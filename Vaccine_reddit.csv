Please get this through your heads, 

None of that matters! IT DOESN’T fucking matter ok? We are all being still being dicked by the same people and same fucking organizations, and the same slave system. People seem to forget how many other players are involved in this game or theatre if you like, you still got China, Russia, U.N., Vatican, Intelligence agencies, media, banking cartel, Hollywood, Council of Foreign Relations, Rockefeller’s, Rothschilds, Israel Mossad... I could go on for days about how many problems the world has, but the point is it doesn’t really matter who you voted for, the show will go on according to plan regardless of your opinions and votes, because it has been planned.The problem isn’t just the players, it’s The WHOLE game, the other teams, coaches, umpires,
Referees, etc.

People are so deluded that they think Trump is going to bring down the whole cabal, stop the great reset, and mass vaccinations, and bring down the media, Vatican, China, U.N., lock up Bill Gates and the Rockefeller’s etc..
I’m sorry but the show is going to go on whether we like it or not, because the other players and “coaches” or handlers in the game still want to play, and they don’t give an ants dick who is selected, because they know the game is rigged in their favor. They don’t even care about the environment, what makes you think they care about you?
You think your that special they care about your wellbeing? That’s cute...

So don’t take this republican / democrat / conservatives stuff too seriously. These are all labels, they are constructs made by man, all they do is separate and divide us. They are all tools of the elite to control and manipulate you and play with your emotions.

Even if Trump is re-elected, you can bet on your life that the game plan would still continue. Because there’s Too many players that want it too continue, they have invested a lot of time and money and aren’t ready to lose it that easily.

The show must go on...

In 2010 scientists in Wuhan published [a study stating they combined HIV parts with SARS](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00705-010-0729-6). This was building on a 2007 study where they tried combining a [*SARS-like bat coronavirus with HIV pseudovirus* that was not previously infectious to humans](https://jvi.asm.org/content/82/4/1899). While they were researching the SARS-like bat Coronavirus, they were unhappy with the low rate at which it infected human cells. So they genetically altered it to make it infect human cells more effectively -- by giving it an HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) outer shell, which enabled the SARS-like coronavirus to attack human cells via ACE2 receptors.

**FYI you’ll notice a lot of these articles have disclaimers (some brand new since yesterday) about them being used as a conspiracy. They offer absolutely no counter argument** other than “it came from bats, therefor it is not from the lab.” Uhh okay, not disputing it came from bats.

9,"One of the most important interviews on the Internet just got even more important, because of the pandemic, now the jigsaw of the plan for the future is almost complete, and the head architects are surely the Rockefeller Family.",5220.0,fs4sxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fs4sxj/one_of_the_most_important_interviews_on_the/,1180.0,1585622275.0,"First here's a brief version of the post summed up quickly:-

1. Decades ago a highly credible investigator, Norman Dodd, discovered that the tax-exempt foundations e.g. Rockefeller Foundation etc, wanted to make changes to society, and their tool of choice (at that time) was war.

2. The tax-exempt foundations said they would continue to use war until they had other effective methods for making major societal changes.

3. 10 years ago, a high-level Rockefeller document described details of other methods for influencing how the world evolves, one such scenario which was suggested in the document was a pandemic.

4. What societal changes do the Rockefellers desire? 
A former Rockefeller family friend blew the whistle on the plans the Rockefellers had for the future.  He was told they want everyone chipped for tracking and to buy/sell.  If they don't like you they will turn off your chip to make it incredibly difficult for you to function in society.

Conclusion:-  The Rockefellers no longer rely on war to make changes in the world, now they have other tools at their disposal, such as pandemics.  Their goal is take away our freedoms, then if we want them back we'll be forced to receive vaccines to gain a digital certificate of movement which allows us to be tracked on 5G control grids. Over time it will be placed onto a chip, which will be hard to avoid. By then society will be cashless, making life without a chip a struggle, almost impossible.

Chief suspects for causing this pandemic = Rockefeller family and their many proxies.

Longer version with more detail:-

[This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RgRGWlDo70) with the late [Norman Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Dodd) was already viewed as one of the most important on the Internet.  If you haven't seen it before, you really must add it to your list.  Dodd was the chief investigator of the Reece Committee, his job was to look into the tax-exempt founds e.g. Rockefeller Foundation, and to find out what they were actually up to.  In the interview he explains that the foundations are really there to make changes in the world, and that the only way they know how to make changes is through war, so their job is really to start wars.  Since war was the only effective method they knew for making major changes, they would continue to use it until they had other equivalently effective methods.  

10 years ago the [Rockefeller Foundation released a scenario document, Page 18](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf), where they looked into different scenarios which could influence the way in which our world evolves, one of the scenarios analyzed was a pandemic.  So what we're seeing here, is that over the decades the Rockefeller Foundation has moved on, they no longer rely on war as a tool to make changes, now they have new tools at their disposal, like pandemics, making them the chief suspects as to who has placed the world into the current pandemic scenario.

Now, you may be wondering what kinds of changes the Rockefellers want to make to society, well one of their [former friends blew the whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzzBix1NdU) in a video of similar importance to the Norman Dodd interview.  Aaron Russo was a filmmaker and a close friend with one of the Rockefellers.  Aaron was told their secret plans for the world, which included everyone being micro-chipped in a cashless society, where one requires an implanted micro-chip for buying and selling.  If TPTB didn't like what you were doing they could switch off your chip, making it almost impossible for you to function in society.

So, as Bill Gates (who is allied with the Rockefellers) recently [admitted on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/), the plan is for people to have digital certificates of movement, Germany is calling them [antibody certificates](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-germany-covid-19-immunity-certificates-testing-social-distancing-lockdown-2020-3?r=US&IR=T).  It's very easy to see how these digital certificates of movement, initially on your smart phone, will eventually be installed on implanted micro-chips, in case you lose your phone and for your convenience, they will say.  You won't be allowed in society without one, as they will claim you may spread a virus, for you to be allowed out in public they will force you to have this, which also means receiving the vaccines and whatever ingredients eugenics enthusiasts Gates and the Rockefellers decide to put in them.

Last but not least, the 5G control grid which is being rapidly rolled out is there to track your movement by connecting with the digital certificate/chip, this is why 5G is being prioritized despite there being so much public resistance and unknown health risks.  While 4G was similar, it is nowhere near as fast and cannot make as many connections, with 5G they can track us in real time.

How can the Rockefellers be stopped?  

The perfect thing about their plan is that they can keep on attacking us with wave after wave of pandemic until we give in.  That means to stop them we need high level people in the world to get onboard, deciding enough is enough.  There needs to be arrests and all their essentially terrorist operations must be shut down once and for all, the Rockefellers and Mr Gates can no longer be tolerated as being above the law.",conspiracy,Vaccine

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

Since the vaccines became available he’s been pressuring me to get it; however, I have stood my ground and refused. We’ve gotten into so many arguments about the vaccines, until recently I told him I’m done talking about COVID vaccines, I’m not getting it, and to please leave me tf alone about it. We’re a gay couple btw.

Fast forward to today… we come to Mexico. Before we even got here so many of our vaccinated friends and family were coming up positive for COVID. It’s pretty insane just how many… But my husband is trying to scare me - he’s telling me I’m gonna get stranded here, I’m gonna be stuck at the hotel, etc etc….. it’s almost like he’s not accepting that all the ppl we know who are getting COVID are vaccinated.

So we get here and he gets sick the next day. And it’s really bad - he was running a fever, he has chills… it was bad. I was scared. So we both took COVID tests. He’s positive and I’m negative. Three days later I take another COVID test, and it comes up negative again. And I feel fine - great actually.

So he begins to tell our friends that he’s positive (and that I’m negative). He’s downplaying his level of sickness. But I’m slightly annoyed because most of their responses are to tell me I need to get vaccinated. They all think that the vaccine has saved his life and he would’ve died otherwise.

It’s like I’m living in an alternate reality. I can only imagine everyone’s responses if I were the one with COVID. Are these people brainwashed. It feels like Stockholm Syndrome. Also worth mentioning, a lot of his friends have been scared to be around me because I’m unvaccinated.

**Covinfo Data Dump:-**

The current Covid19 vaccines have several problems. I would say that there are 9 main areas of interest:

*  the spike protein appears to be cytotoxic.

*  the emergence of immune escape variants.

*  the potential for antibody dependent enhancement.

*  the potential for autoimmune disorders.

*  the narrow design focus of the vaccines.

*  the fact that alternative treatments are available to both prevent and treat covid.

*  they are trying to jab everyone, even people who have recovered from covid and do not need the jab.

*  there are a growing number of severe reactions to the vaccines but this fact gets very little coverage in the press and sometimes it even gets outright censorship.

*  the potential for long term unknown side effects and the potential impact of this on national security.

I will present a brief overview of each issue and then provide scientific data below for support (except for 9. which is more a discussion based on a logical assessment of future risk).

**1.** The spike protein of the virus, that is also being utilized in the vaccines, is damaging to our cells through 3 mechanisms. The first is that when the spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor it causes the ACE2 to send signals to the mitochondria within the cell which destroys the mitochondria, eventually killing the cell. The second is that when the spike protein binds to our ACE2 receptors it causes the ACE2 to send signals to other cells which increases the amount of pro-inflammatory agents in the blood. This inflammation damages the tissues. The third way is that when the spike protein binds to the ACE2 of the platelets in our blood, it causes them to clot. Now, the vaccine manufacturers did take steps to make the spike protein more safe. The spike protein has two parts an S1 subunit and an S2 subunit. The S1 is the part that connects to the ACE2, and the S2 is the part that opens up like a knife stabbing the membrane and facilitates fusion between the membrane of the cell and the envelope of the virus. With the vaccines, they modified the S2 subnit so that it could not open up and jab into the cell membranes if it connects with any ACE2 receptors. They thought this would make the spike protein safe, but this assumption is false and if they had taken the time to do more research before rushing to production they would have found that out. It may seem like the jabby bit is what damages the cells, but actually the major damage is caused by the S1 connecting to the ACE2 receptor. Just the S1, by itself without the S2, causes the ACE2 receptor to start the cell signaling processes that cause the mitochondrial damage, the pro-inflammatory response, and the blood clots.

**Biodistribution data:-**

Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs): https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf

Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell: https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines

**2.** Vaccine enhanced immune escape occurs when a poorly designed or weak vaccine helps create new variants. This happens in the exact same way as antibiotic resistance and regular old evolution. In the case of evolution, if you want to make an organism stronger, you put it under evolutionarily unfavorable conditions. This way you kill all the weak examples of the organism and just leave the strong ones. If you want to create heat resistant bacteria, put a petri dish full of the bacteria under moderately high heat that kills 99% of the bacteria. Save the 1% that were able to survive the heat, allow them to grow, and repeat the process over and over again while turning up the heat just a little each time. Do this until you have a population of bacteria that are all extremely heat resistant. The same process occurs with antibiotic resistance. When you only take half your meds, you kill 99% of the bacteria and you leave only the 1% that were slightly more resistant to the drugs and now they flourish. Before they were a small part of the population but you changed the conditions of their environment so that they have the advantage. You've killed all the normal bacteria that the mutant variants had to compete with so that now the antibiotic resistant bacteria are the alpha strain that have unlimited resources and so surge in population to take over your body. Well, the same thing happens with viruses and vaccines. 

If you produce a vaccine that elicits a weak immune response, you are creating an unfavorable environment for the virus. This will kill the weak 99%, and leave those 1% of mutant virus particles that are not as hindered by the antibodies produced by the vaccine. Whereas before these mutants were only a tiny part of the population and would have been unlikely to transmit on to the next person. Now these mutant virus particles surge in number because they no longer have to compete with the other virus particles and your bodies defenses do not work. They are now highly likely to transmit on to the next person, whereas before they would not have been able to leave the host in which the mutation occured. In terms of creating variants, the current covid vaccines are very bad for three reasons. First, some vaccine manufacturers require two shots and now also boosters because the first shot produces a very weak immune response. Second, the vaccines are very leaky. Even after you have gotten a full immune response from both shots, you can still get and transmit the virus onto others. Well, which virus particles are likely to get passed on by a fully vaccinated person? Clearly they will be those virus particles that have the ability to multiply quickly while avoiding the antibodies produced by the vaccines. This will create very virulent and antibody resistant variants. Watch for these variants in the news as time goes on, we're already seeing things like Delta, Lambda, Eplsion, etc. 

As we implement boosters, they will start to come at faster and faster rates, and over time data scientists will start to see timed correlations between the implementation of mass boosters and the emergence of new strains. Third, the vaccines do seem to help reduce the severity of the disease when people are infected (although this may change as new variants emerge). Why would this be a concern? Well, because of the leakiness of the vaccines we just spoke about. If you have very low symptoms but you can still get and transmit the virus, then you won't even realize that you're sick and you'll be spreading the virus to even more people as an asymptomatic carrier. So, these vaccines will only increase transmission by creating more and more asymptomatic carriers (although this may not be a bad thing, if everyone in the world gets the virus and everyone is asymptomatic, then there's really no need to care about covid anymore. But this is an unrealistic idealization that is unlikely to occur, some people will still get sick and die or suffer long haul covid). One additional point to address here is the claim that the unvaccinated are causing the emergence of new vaccine resistant variants. Let me be clear, the unvaccinated absolutely have the ability to facilitate the creation of new variants. However, it would require a statistically enormous number of people to get the virus before they could produce a new variant by chance. This is because a mutant virus particle will only make up a small portion of the virus population inside a person's body. 

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this particular particle will be able to spread to a new person. Whereas, in the vaccinated, their weak immune response specifically selects for the mutant variants. It is highly likely that if a vaccinated person passes on the virus to another person, the particles they pass on will be those that have the ability to escape from the immune response elicited by the vaccines. An analogy would be if you did an experiment with 500 room temperature petri dishes filled with bacteria and 500 heated petri dishes with bacteria, then found a heat resistant variant but didn't know which dish it came from. It would be absurd to think that the heat resistant strain of bacteria came from the room temperature petri dishes. It would possible, sure, but completely improbable that the heat resistant strain had suddenly appeared in a room temp petri dish. There would be no reason for it to become a dominant strain in that environment. Logically, statistically, and evolutionarily, it must have come from the heated petri dishes. This is a very basic and obvious conclusion, but the media and government bureaucrats in lab coats are trying to tell you that the absurd thing is true. They're trying to say that the unvaccinated (the room temperature petri dishes) are where the vaccine resistant strains are coming from.

Article from 2021 explains that unless vaccination is done quickly, there will be a high probability of escape mutants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95025-3

**3.** There is a potential for ADE, antibody dependent enhancement. This is when the virus mutates so that the antibodies no longer neutralize the virus but the antibodies still try to attach to it. This can actually help the virus get into your immune cells because when the virus is covered with antibodies it will draw macrophages to the virus that will try to eat it. However, when your macrophages come to eat the virus particle that they think has been neutralized, the virus gets inside them and starts replicating because the antibodies actually didn't neutralize the virus. Your own antibodies act like a kind of Trojan Horse. Another way that ADE can happen is your own antibodies connect to the receptors of your cells and actually help the virus get in directly. This was a huge problem with the Dengue vaccine and we need to do a lot of testing to make sure this isn't a possibility. Clearly with these rushed vaccines we haven't eliminated this possibility and with the virus mutating, ADE may pop up with a later variant. We must stay vigilant and keep an eye out for this signal. It will manifest as people with high antibody levels being more likely to get sick and die.

**Antibody Dependent Enhancement:-**

**4.** There is a potential for an autoimmune response from the vaccines. The vaccines that were developed for Sars-Cov-1 used the spike protein, just like the vaccines for Sars-Cov-2. Unfortunately, those vaccines caused the animals to develop serious autoimmune disorders and they ended up causing severe organ damage. There is a question about whether these new vaccines, which also focus on the spike protein, will also cause autoimmune disorders. The problem is that autoimmune disorders take time to develop and to show up. It may also take a long time before doctors and scientists can link the sudden rise in autoimmune disorders with these vaccines. Usually, in a vaccine trial you closely monitor your trial group for years and years. This allows you to identify the signals. With the current program of injecting millions of people, there will be no clear way to link causation to the vaccines and an increase in autoimmune disorders may just fly under the radar. We may not know for a very long time or never. Another concern is that because of the way the mRNA vaccines work, they cause your own cells to present as foreign entities. Your immune system comes over and starts killing your own cells. This has never been done before in human history. We have no idea if there will be long term consequences for this and whether this will lead to autoimmune disorders.

Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186

**5.** The mRNA vaccines are narrowly focused on just the spike protein when they could have been designed to target more proteins. The Covid19 coronavirus has 4 main proteins. There are 3 on its outside and 1 on the inside. The S-protein, the M-protein, and the E-protein, are on the outside, while the N-protein is on the inside. When you get a natural infection your body will likely produce antibodies for all or most of these proteins (depending on the function of your own unique immune system). We knew from studying Sars-Cov-1 that antibodies to the S-protein and the M-protein are both neutralizing. In fact, they used exactly that knowledge when they designed the current vaccines. So, they could have tried to make vaccines that utilize the M-protein to avoid the potential for autoimmune disorders discussed above. But they didn't, they instead focused only on the S-protein. They could have designed the vaccines so that they present both the S-protein and the M-protein. This would have made the vaccines much more effective and less leaky since any mutated virus particles would have to have mutated both the S-protein and the M-protein to avoid the antibodies. Whereas, the current vaccines are narrowly focused on just the S-protein, meaning that the virus only has to mutate the one protein. It is exponentially harder for an organism to mutate two beneficial traits vs just mutating one beneficial trait. So, these vaccines are worse than they could have been.

**Vaccine efficacy:-**

Article explains how vaccine manufacturers have used relative risk reduction to determine that vaccine efficacy is ~90+%, however they should have used absolute risk reduction which would tell us that the vaccines will only reduce total covid cases by ~1%: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext

Addendum to the above information. This video from 2013 explains the difference between relative and absolute risk reduction in a very simple way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K30MGvOs5s&ab_channel=TerryShaneyfelt

Article from 2005 explains that antibodies to the S-protein and the M-protein are effective in neutralizing the sars-cov1 virus. However, the sars-cov2 vaccines only target the S-protein. This is evidence that the vaccine manufacturers could have chosen to make a superior mrna vax that produced two types of antibodies, but chose to focus narrowly on just the S-protein: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16544518/

Antibodies from vaccines start to drop within 6 months, get ready for endless boosters: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9

**6.** There are alternative treatments that are effective against Covid19 but they are being suppressed. Why? Because the vaccines are not approved by the FDA but instead they are emergency use authorized only. The emergency use authorization can only be granted if ""there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives"". Well, a growing body of scientific research is showing that both Ivermectin and Fluvoxamine (among other drugs) are adequate alternatives for early treatment of Covid19, and both of these drugs have been FDA approved for years. Unfortunately, that means they are now off patent and no one can make any money off of them. So, for the vaccines to continue to receive their EUA, the existence of these treatments must be suppressed. We have seen a huge amount of censorship of doctors who have been speaking out about these drugs.

**Ivermectin:-**

Emergency use authorization for the vaccines cannot be granted if there are effective alternative approved treatments for Covid19. So, if the pharmaceutical industry is going to make any money off covid, they must suppress the existence of any existing off patent drugs that may be effective in treating or preventing covid: https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization

**7.** We've known for decades that once you are infected with a virus or disease, your body creates a robust immune response, including memory T cells and B cells. These cells stick around so that you can quickly respond to a new infection. However, this fact is being completely ignored by vaccine pushers, they want a needle in every arm, even in the arms of those who do not need it, like the covid recovered. We might say, well covid is new and different, and perhaps immunity wanes after a time. This assumption was prudent in the beginning of the pandemic but now we have lots of evidence that the covid recovered have a near zero chance of getting sick again. Your body takes a few weeks and months to build up its antibodies after an infection. Most of the time the second infection takes place during this time frame. There is no reason to force every covid recovered patient to take an experimental drug, especially after that initial 3 month period after they have build up a sufficient immune response. If you still think that the miniscule chance that their immune system has failed makes them a danger, then why are these people not asked for proof of antibodies. It's because they don't actually care if you have antibodies. The vaccinated, without knowing whether they have antibodies or not, can walk around free, but a covid recovered patient, with proof of antibodies is still considered a danger. It's ass backwards and it is evidence that vax pushers don't actually care about immunity. It is just about getting a needle into every arm. The reason why they are doing this, I do not know I leave it up to you, but it doesn't make sense and I make a point of not going along with things that don't make sense.

**8.** There is a growing amount of data that people are having severe reactions to the vaccines. It gets little to no coverage in the press, in some cases people who talk about their reactions on social media are being censored and called anti-vaxxers (I mean, how asinine to call someone who took the jab an anti-vaxxer) or fakers (I am sure some are faking for money/attention, but I highly doubt it's many of them given the social consequences for lying). Some senators have done press conferences with these people so they can tell their stories. There are publicly accessible government databases which contain reports of people who have had adverse reactions to the vaccines. These systems were put in place in the 90's to act as a sort of early warning system and to give transparency to the public after previous botched vaccine rollouts like the 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle. You can go and read these reports for yourself. There are websites that download the reports and present them to the public in a very readable manner (the government website from the 90's is not very good). There are concerns that these reports are being made in error or by bad actors. However, research has been done into these systems and it was found that more than 80% of the adverse reactions had seemingly no other cause or explaination aside from the vaccine. In the past, if a vaccine hit 50 deaths or a few hundred adverse reactions on these reporting systems, they would shutdown the vaccination program. As of writing this, for the covid vaccines the deaths are into the thousands and the serious adverse reactions are into the hundreds of thousands. Yet they just keep rolling with the shots and now are even forcibly manadating the shot.

**VAERS:-**

Analysis on the VAERS death data shows that in 86% of reports the vaccine cannot be ruled out as a causal factor in the death of the patient: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis

Addendum to the above link. OpenVAERS is a site that allows you to easily read VAERS reports and breaks down the numbers. The reports seem to be a lot of people who have comorbidities or are old, but there are also some really eye opening cases where young people experience horrible side effects. Read for yourself and make up your own mind about what the vax is doing to your fellow Americans: https://www.openvaers.com/openvaers

**9.** Criminals are innocent until proven guilty, but medical drugs are not like criminals, medical drugs are guilty until proven innocent. Pharmaceutical companies must prove the innocence of their medications through long term testing. Doctors, bureaucrats, and the public seem to have forgotten this fact when they mandate a new technology to be injected into us without long term testing to prove the innocence of the drug. The vaccine may have completely unknown and serious side effects that manifest in a majority of the people only in the long term. So, the vax may appear to be safe in the short term, but in the long run it causes severe harm or even death. It is extremely risky to innoculate the entire population if we don't know what the long term effects may be. It is especially risky to vax our critical workers with an experimental drug about which we know nothing in the long term. If it turns out that within 2 years of taking it, the vaccine causes the debilitation of a large portion of the people who took it and we had forced all our healthcare professionals to take it, then our countries will lose a large portion of their healthcare professionals. This would devastate our society's ability to treat the sick and cause massive death and suffering. Same goes for the military. If we vax all our fighters, and the vax turns out to greatly physically or mentally weaken most of the people who took it, there goes our ability to defend ourselves. We won't be able to fight off any aggressors and will lose years of military experience as we will have to re-train a whole new set of recruits without the previous military leaders. If most of the laborers are vaxxed and the vax causes bodily weakness, then they won't be able to go to work and our production falls to zero. Without domestic production, we would have to rely on foreign imports but the economy would also grind to a halt so the nation would have no money to pay for these imports. This would probably be a death stroke for whatever nation was victim to it. So, force vaccinating critical workers, or even a large portion of the menial labor force, is a massive national security risk. We also have no way of calculating how large the percentage of risk is since we know nothing at all about the long term effects of innoculation with this type of technology. This could utterly destroy any highly vaxxed nations. This outcome would be so bad (total collapse of a society's infrastructure) that only a massive amount of safety data could justify innoculating the entire population with any treatment. But we just don't have that safety data for these experimental drugs right now, and will probably not have it for decades to come. By then, it will be too late to do anything about it. You can fry an egg, but you can't unfry it. Just the same, you won't be able to unvax the population, there's no way to get the vax out of the body once it's in. The solution is to only vax the old and vulnerable at risk populations and not vax everyone. This issue worries me deeply since there must be risk responsive people at high levels of government who must understand and be sensitive to this type of national security risk. Yet, these people are either being completely ignored or they are allowing the government to proceed with the risky mass vaccination programs anyway.

Separately, these 9 issues would be a concern. But put together, they are incredibly alarming. To me, something feels very wrong here. You too may have already felt it in your gut or in the back of your mind or when reading this. That feeling that something is wrong is instinct, it is the product of millions of years of evolution. A gift from our ancestors who also saw something that was wrong in their environment and had this weird bad feeling. They acted on it and it saved them. So they were able to pass on that instinct to their off-spring from generation to generation. Now, after millions of years, it finds its way to you. If you feel what I feel, that something is very wrong here, I implore you:

I want to declare that I have lost hope in ALL of humanity. I thought that the average person had an ounce of thought in them but it seems like most people are brainless zombies whose stupidity is a danger to society. 

Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, fuck everyone who has allowed this to go on for this long. I lost my early twenties to this shit and have lost hope that people will revolt against the government. I have lost friends over not being vaccinated (fuck them anyway), I have experienced physical health problems because of this bullshit. Mental health problems. You name it. Why? All because people are IDIOTS who would rather listen to the same fear driven narrative after two fucking years than to actually think for themselves. At this point I don’t fear a virus. I fear people’s endless and unchecked STUPIDITY. Are people really that dumb to be blind to how much they are getting played by their government? At this point I’m struggling to understand how these people even functioned before the pandemic with such little brain function. 

The UK government has seen how much of an idiot the average person is. In fact, they have been releasing footage/pictures every few days showing us how government officials and our PM, Boris Johnson, have all been breaking lockdown rules since last year. They think we are IDIOTS and honestly I AGREE WITH THEM!!! They are literally making a fool out of everyone and it’s making people angry. They are laughing at us because 2 years in and we are only getting stupider. 

We could have stopped this but now what? We are, once again, being brainwashed with this Omicron bs. Honestly, let people be injected with 50 boosters in the future. They have ruined the lives of the younger generation and I honestly could not give a shit about what happens to anyone at this point.

You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Vaccine

The news has just come out that our “Freedom Day” in Sydney/New South Wales will be on October 18, when pubs, cafes, restaurants, retail shops and hairdressers can finally re-open but only for the fully vaccinated. Only the fully vaccinated will be able to attend weddings and funerals and travel regionally, with a special app pass that will be essential for movement within the state. 

I don’t want the vaccine. My husband doesn’t want the vaccine. Other than this, we are fully vaccinated.  I have a family history of heart attacks in the 40s and my own clotting issues that arose in 2019 and I am very worried about adverse effects of both the Pfizer and AZ vaccines. My doctor won’t give me an exemption. In fact, I was told just recently that I will soon have to find a different family doctor as the practice will soon only see patients that are vaccinated. 

We have a wedding later in the year and a regional holiday booked in December which now won’t happen for us. My children want to go to a toy shop and they don’t like Zoom. I want to touch the clothes I buy to check the quality. I want to smell the candles that I am planning to get as Christmas presents for the family. But I can’t.

I am not ok and I can’t tell anyone except my husband about it if they ask me tomorrow on R U OK Day because they will think I am selfish for not having the vaccine, despite my fears being based only on my own medical history.

I have worried about many things in life but this right here is beyond the realm of anything I ever feared.

Edit 1: it’s late at night here in Sydney and I won’t get to respond to all your comments tonight. I had a good cry before but your thoughts and tips have given me hope  and strength - thank you.

Unfortunately my father isn’t one of those people.

Prior to his booster, my father was a hard working, successful man. He was bringing in about 20k a month, had a beautiful home, and a decent life overall. That all changed once he got his booster in December.

He went for his booster shot on 12/23 at 10AM. I arrived at his house at around 8PM to find him on the floor, unresponsive, covered in a pool of urine.

Called 911, brought him into the hospital. Told every doctor and nurse that he had gotten his booster about 8-10 hours ago, they all looked at me as if I was insane.

Turns out my dad had a stroke. What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. 

Since then, he’s been a wreck. He hasn’t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything. He used to be a healthy active man, since the stroke he stopped cooking for himself, stopped exercising, eats like shit, and hasn’t been able to return to his job. He’s now back in the hospital for a blood clot in his leg and narrowly missed amputation. He is going to have no choice but to sell his home as he cannot continue to afford it with no income.

Thank you big pharma for ruining my fathers life! And taking away from mine.

72,The conspiracy around using proper diagnostic tools to assess myocarditis,3136.0,si9hwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/si9hwu/the_conspiracy_around_using_proper_diagnostic/,69.0,1643759516.0,"Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) is a documented possible adverse reaction the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.

Myocarditis resolves in weeks or months in 50% of cases. In the other 50%, the immune system perpetuates a chronic inflammatory state, which leads towards cardiac myopathy, and eventual congestive heart failure, which can shorten lifespan by 10-20 years.

In Australia, the Federal Government has collaborated with ATAGI (Aus version of the FDA) to produce a set of guidelines for doctors for assessing myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. The guidelines tell doctors to use 4 tests: ECG, inflammatory blood markers, troponin levels, and chest X-Ray.

To the non-expert, this might seem reasonable. However, if you turn to the myocarditis scholarly literature, it all says the same thing: these 4 tests are not ‘sensitive’ for myocarditis, and indeed are negative more often than not in cases of myocarditis. Research shows that troponin rise only occurs in about 30% of myocarditis cases, for eg. This means these tests generate lots of ‘false negatives’ for myocarditis (even though when they are all positive they can indeed be used to ‘rule in’ myocarditis). The only tests that can definitely rule out myocarditis are MRI of the heart, and cardiac biopsy. Nowhere in the Australian guidelines do they mention cardiac MRI.

Is this a mere oversight? Possibly. The Australian Government, as in other jurisdictions, has setup an insurance scheme to provide pay-outs to those who have suffered covid vaccine injuries. The more confirmed cases of such injury, the more the Government pays out. Curious that they have instructed doctors to use 4 tests that are frequently negative even when myocarditis exists, and failed to mention the 1 non-invasive test (MRI) that is the 'gold standard' for diagnosing it, and produces almost no ‘false negatives.’

In my own case, I have seen a cardiologist and had an ED admission, after presenting with all the classic symptoms of myocarditis. In both cases they did the 4 tests listed above and told me I was fine, and did everything they could to downplay possible negative consequences of the vaccine - the doctors' sole focus seemed to be minimising 'vaccine hesitancy'. I am not fine. I have gone from doing 4 intense boxing sessions/week to being unable to do any exercise beyond a short walk on flat ground without experiencing major chest pain and shortness of breath, which has been ongoing for the 3 months since my vaccination. I am seeing the cardiologist again this week, and will strenously request an MRI of the heart. At this stage, despite these problems, in no hospital records have I been documented as having any diagnosable problem. I am sure this would be true of many individuals who were involved in the initial mRNA trials, which came up with the data about myocarditis supposedly affecting only 1/100,000. The real numbers, if proper assessment with cardiac MRI had been used, would be massive. My GP, who is pretty good, thinks about 1/100 are getting persisting myocarditis (ie not just a few heartbeat flutters for a few days).

Anyone with ongoing chest tightness/pain/palpitations/shortness of breath, please be aware that only an MRI of your heart will make sure that myocarditis is not being missed. The other usual cardiac tests, of course, need to be done as well, but if they are negative that doesn't actually exclude myocarditis.

The point is, you should stop shaming us just because ""rEaL tYrAnNy"" is happening on the other side of the world. Where were you fucks when Obama bombed the living hell out of Afghanistan? Where were you fucks when Trudeau painted his face BLACK and stuck his tongue out with a banana in his hand singing ""DAYOOO"" (or honestly during any of his other million scandals).

But most importantly, where the FUCK were you when the Canadian government decided it would be a good idea to ban your fellow citizens from travelling across our great country, or when Canadian universities & colleges banned and de-enrolled their unvaccinated students on a split second decision (who PAID for their educations and got ROBBED).

Where were you all this time? You don't have to stare at your computer screens and seethe about Russia/Ukraine to feel like you're united against tyranny when it's already in the atmosphere around you. Beaten protestors, frozen bank accounts, emergency orders, digital vaccine QR codes, travel bans, the thousand lockdowns that bankrupted people...should I go on?

**Recent Conspiracies:**

Political:

- The Secret Correspondence Between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/545738/

- The indictment of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, suggested that the president’s top lieutenant for part of last year was a highly paid agent for pro-Russian foreign interests. And the guilty plea extracted from George Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser, confirmed the second known attempt by Mr. Trump’s team to tap Moscow for damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, coming months before his son Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for the same purpose. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-manafort-indictment-analysis.html

- Inside Hillary Clinton’s Secret Takeover of the DNC, by Donna Brazile. Per an agreement between the Clinton Campaign and the DNC: In exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings. https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

- In its self-described ""pied piper"" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new ""mainstream of the Republican Party"" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning, telling the press to take Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruz seriously, rather than marginalizing them. http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/

Science Whistleblowers and information about little known problems in science: 

- ""Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government.

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

- Of the 84,000 chemicals in commercial use in the United States -- from flame retardants in furniture to household cleaners -- nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision. The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html

Top comment heard from at least 25 different redditors with “unique” opinions:

> That catchphrase is just popular because of comedian Joe Rogan. 


But these delusional dolts are forgetting how Dr Malone, a genius doctor who created the groundwork for the experimental mrna, phrased in a really eloquent on a Joe Rogan Podcast heard by 80 million people, how this country is full of blind idiots losing their fucking minds by taking experimental gene therapy with absolutely zero long term research. 


This phrase is causing mental breakdowns in logic as redditors are seething and coping because now Dr Malone’s eloquent way of explaining their neurosis is popular and they don’t want to be stereotyped as delusional religious nuts for $cience

**Second edit**

For the Vaxxed worried that hey maybe this vaccine is going to harm me since there is no long term data and Pfizer sucks dick at making drugs that work safely, here’s a list of items that I recommend you have in your cabinet if you start noticing autoimmune flare ups like eczema, eye redness, skin legions, or a cold that won’t go away, it could be a sign of Antibody Dependent Enhancement, something Dr Malone correctly predicted as an outcome for the vaccinated as new variants developed:

* PQQ
* Daily aspirin or eat garlic daily
* Milk thistle can help too
* Regeneron, yes, the trump touted regeneron that was mocked is now currently in clinical trials as a treatment for the ADE as well as for symptoms of spike proteins. 
* Prayer. Seriously, start praying because even the cdc is only relying on hope at this point since their is no data that the boosters will help you. Probably won’t, so seriously start praying it does. 

For the unvaxxed looking to boost their immune system without becoming a lab rat, add these to your medicine cabinet: 

*  Liposomal vitamin C
* vitamin d3+k2
*  vitamin b6
*  zinc
*  omega-3
*  beta glucans
*  l-lysine
*  n-acetyl cysteine (NAC)
*  selenium
*  elderberry 
*  Ahcc

From hosting numerous Drs and scientists questioning the vaccines or how the whole ordeal has been handled to curing his own case of Covid with Ivermectin, Vitamin D and Zinc. The guy has the biggest podcast on earth and has used his platform to call bullshit.

The media can’t stand him now. He’s censored on YouTube and Spotify constantly and publications that used to rave about his podcast are now ridiculing him relentlessly.

I always thought the guy was genuine. I’ve been a fan for a long time. So now more than ever, support this dude.

Let the record show. I don’t care if he is PRO VACCINE. That isn’t the point. At all.

>**”They are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection but against hospitalization and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all age groups. It isn't just the elderly,"" Fauci said. ""It's waning to the point that you're seeing more and more people getting breakthrough infections, and more and more of those people who are getting breakthrough infections are winding up in the hospital.”**

>**Fauci went on to say, ""I think … that the boosting is gonna be an absolutely essential component of our response, not a bonus, not a luxury, but an absolute essential part of the program.""**

>**According to the virus expert, researchers did not ""have to time"" to do extensive studies to determine whether two doses would be better than three, as there was a pressing need to get vaccines out to people sooner rather than later, which was ""life-saving for millions of people,"" he noted.**

>And as more time passes, we'll be able to see how long the boosters keep recipients protected from COVID—but Fauci is optimistic. **”We don't have the proof yet—the proof of the pudding will be after you get people vaccinated and boosted, and we have a greater durability of protection that doesn't wane as easily.”**

On Tuesday I decided to comply and get the vaccine because I didn't want to lose my career. I love my job and am very excited for what's coming next for me. I got the 1st dose of the pfizer vaccine. 

On Wednesday I went to urgent care because along with the other expected side effects I was experiencing bad shortness of breath to the point where getting dressed had me exhausted to the point where I needed to sit down and rest. I also had chest pain/discomfort/pressure surrounding my heart area (it feels like there is a rock in my chest that is slightly oversized for the space it occupies). The doctor there did an EKG which came back with signs of heart inflammation but was otherwise normal.  She discharged me saying I had signs of myocarditis after receiving the vaccine and told me to go to the ER immediately so they could check for other signs that she was unable to do herself.

Fast forward the ER doctor was very dismissive. He told me I ""did the right thing"" getting the vaccine repeatedly. He told me my symptoms could be a muscle strain or acid reflux, and also said maybe I have covid (though he did not test me). I purposely did not tell him I had covid before because i suspected they would try to tell me my condition was from that instead. I was discharged after bloodwork, chest x-rays and a CT scan.

On Friday I followed up with a primary care doctor. I needed to get it in writing that I should delay or forego completely the 2nd dose otherwise my employer will still make me comply. This doctor informed me that my ekg did show signs of heart inflammation and that my blood platelets were high. These are indicators of inflammation and clotting. He referred me to a cardiologist and agreed that I should wait to get the 2nd dose until consulting with him. I asked him to provide me written documentation of this as well as his recommendation that I should wait at least 1.5 months for the 2nd dose, otherwise I will be fired. He said okay ""no problen I will be right back""

When he returned to the room:

Him: ""so I talked with my supervisor and we aren't allowed to provide that documentation except for in extreme circumstances""

Me: ""so what you're saying is I basically need to be having a heart attack for you to write your recommendations on the vaccine down?

Him: ""yes""

Me: ""if I was sent to the ER with these exact symptoms after receiving the flu vaccine, would your recommendation be that I never get that vaccine again in my entire life?""

Him: ""yes""

Me: ""it is utterly pathetic that you cannot document in writing what you just recommended to me 5 minutes ago""

Him: ""I agree""

Me: ""well then can you give me the name of a doctor who can?""

Him: ""no""

Throughout this conversation he blinked a lot and avoided eye contact. I could tell he was fighting his own moral battle about keeping his own job versus doing the right thing. There are bearucratic pressures influencing the quality and accuracy of the care we are getting from our doctors. I have lost complete and utter trust for our medical providers.

Vaccinated 1 dose (12+) = 93.90%
Vaccinated 2 dose (12+) = 86.88%

- you cannot enter a hospital and visit a family patient if you are not vaccinated.
- you cannot travel legally if you are vaccinated, and you cannot leave the country.
- QR code based apps implemented to visit any public venue. This means you cannot just fake a paper card, all is digital. 
- if vaxxed you go into a coffee shop only to be forced to fill up documents about yourself before you get to enjoy your coffee. Excuse me? Why would I waste my time and give my personal information for a 2$ coffee?
- if vaxxed you sometimes not only show your we code on the app, but you also need to show an additional piece of identity... Just for a damn meal at the restaurant. 

Up until now you could also be at least in grocery stores... Well as of this week, New Brunswick province announces they can ban unvaccinated Canadians from GROCERY STORES! Yes, a grocery store and mall with grocery can check your vaccination status and refuse your entry. 

My province of Quebec is working on a bill announced as of this week to publicize ALL personal and private medical information so that it can be relayed between the doctors, affiliated clinics and the government. The government wants access to files and information currently protected under privacy medical laws. 

It seems my country Canada is full of a bunch of loyalists to absolute governmental power. There is nothing in this that is about health. Not once we're we recommended to be healthy through real-life impactful situations, by being active, eating healthy...

To every other country that hasn't gone full-Canada/Australia/Austria/Israel. Keep fighting and don't forget that the moment you give them an inch and allow them power they will NOT go back on it and will crave for even more power. 

For the obligatory bot or shill that will ask ""where's the conspiracy bro"", ""Health"" is today's corporate-lobbied governmental power-grab, government is lying to all of us, and the political dynamic is not what they say it is The pandemic only helps them further get control over us.

... And for the obligatory bot that will ask ""who is they""... TPTB.

Telling the public they needed more than 1 shot would’ve been hard In the beginning. Baby steps?

Start asking questions…Is this a ’’Business of care’’.What incentive do they have to ending this when indefinite shots rake in billions?

His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being ""forced"" against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more.  

The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy.  He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine.  He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn't provide any evidence either.  Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDC’s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.

Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.  

Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.

Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Maryland’s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.

Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christina’s life.""

So in short:-  

1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money
2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials
3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government
4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms
5. Rinse and repeat

France, Italy, the US, Australia, etc... Tens to Hundreds of Thousands of people showing up to protest against vaccine mandates and vaccine passports. And for whatever reason, there has been a total media blackout about it.

The protests are on such a mass scale, it seems to threatens the entire of the global economy. One weekend of protest in Southwest was enough to basically take down its entire system. Shelves are empty in stores because of port workers and truck drivers losing their jobs. The list goes on. The media, however is telling us that it's all ""transitory inflation"" and that the worker shortage is ""a good thing, because it means people are looking for better jobs."" Complete BS, obviously.

The mainstream media, at this point, is not even trying to make an effort to create a convincing lie. Instead, they're just hoping big tech and big govt do their part in censoring news about what is literally history's largest mass protest.

I have been here for years and have a reputation in my department as being ""an angry conspiracy theorist"" and ""having a problem with authority"", I do not fit in here ... but I work my balls off, and am really good at what I do.

So I am overhearing a couple of co workers talking about New York, and why so many New Yorkers are buying property around where I live. I brought up the Vaccine laws, and mentioned the 9 year old in NY who got arrested for not having a vaccine passport.

They both look at me and in unison ""well she should have had it"" and they look at each other and giggle at the fact they both said the same thing. (yes they are a gay/trans married couple extremely SJW) One of them mentions that ""people who don't take the vaccine shouldn't be allowed in grocery stores or bars""

I respond ""I thought you two were anti fascist.""

Their demeanor changed entirely. One of them goes off:

""A deadly disease is killing millions, we all need to get vaxxed, Its not fascism, its the least you could do. People who aren't vaxxed shouldn't even be allowed in hospitals unless they are getting the vax... Like, if I get to the hospital and an unvaxxed person gets there at the same time , they better see me first or that's bullshit""

My response ""The reasons you both are there is more important than anything when determining who gets seen first. What you said is the same as saying you want the unvaxxed to die""

His response ""I do""

In that moment something truly glorious happened - His supervisor entered the convo with ""I'm, unvaxxed.""

Greatest deer in headlights look ever. ""w-why not?"" he asked legit terrified.

""Because it doesn't do anything. You can still get and spread covid after you're vaxxed. Besides I already had covid. So why would I get vaxxed when I have the antibodies?""

""I don't know"" one of them answered in a confused tone.

I jump in again - ""Studies from the UK are showing that people who are vaxxed dying at a much higher rate than unvaxxed."" and I mentioned UK is getting rid of masks, and vaccine mandates in a couple weeks

A few moment later I overhear one of them say to the other ""Oh shit. They were right""

The other responds ""Why are they mandating it then?""

""I would say fascism, but maybe you prefer totalitarianism"" I respond - Their supervisor has a mini laugh attack.

I then overheard the two them have a conversation about how ""the angry conspiracy theorist in sales was actually right""

This virus will likely never go away regardless of the number of people that wear masks, vaccinate or lockdown. Since the virus is always changing and vaccines don't provide sterilizing immunity, there will always be the need for the next booster since the old ones will no longer be matched to the circulating variant.

In my opinion the whole discussion about the ""optimal"" number of boosters is a distraction to make people believe the end of the mass vaccination program is near and if they just take another dose the virus will be defeated. Once people get used to getting their shots twice a year, they will come out and tell people they need to take these shots forever.

Australia is building large mRNA factories that will be completed in 2024 and will be able to produce 100 million vaccine doses a year. That is 4 doses per person each year.

If they had come out in 2020 and told people that they need to take two doses a year forever people would have rejected it.

They are doing what they have been taught to do in most cases. We all trusted the CDC. We trusted the FDA. We trusted that all clinicians were like us, wanting to actually help and cure people. I have learned just how false that is. 

What you don't understand is that the frontline clinicians who are doing their best, have come to trust leaders that are currently misleading them. The recommemdations and protocols come down from corporate, who are following the cdc guidelines. 

I watched frequent presentations of obviously manipulated data. I listened to constant urging to convince everyone to get this safe and effective vaccine! What I never saw or heard was the truth. No public health officials wanted to discuss VAERS data (vaccine adverse events reporting). No one wanted to discuss unreliable or changing cycle thresholds for the PCR test (false positives/false negatives) No one wanted to acknowledge data from across the world that suggested [Ivermectin](https://web.archive.org/web/20210907152911/https://ivmmeta.com/) as a successful treatment. No one wanted to have to admit that the most vaccinated country on the planet, Isreal, is now the most infected! No one wanted to talk about the change in guidance for cause of death, for who was counted as a ""hospitalized COVID patient"".

There is a script, one narrative. Everything else is ignored, censored or excused. Doctors and nurses on the frontlines do not know these facts because after a 13 hour shift in the thick of it, who wants to hear anything else about it. 
They know what the hospital administration tells them, and that's only what is passed down from corporate. 

They are told to give Remdesivir. That drug killed so many people in a [trial for ebola](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1910993) that it couldn't finish the trial. It causes renal failure and multi system organ failure, you know, the things that the most severe COVID patients seem to die from. This just happened to a friend of mine. I told them not to take him to this certain hospital chain because of this protocol. They took him anyway. He didnt last 48 hours.

As this scenario is witnessed over and over again, it terrifies the nurses. They are told all this death and devastation is from COVID, that's the disease process. No one questions the drug. After all, occasionally it works. It is so much worse than you can comprehend.
 
No one has been given informed consent with these vaccines because all the data has not even been collected and many of the most severe of reported side effects are not listed on the package inserts. I've read them all. 

I'm so disappointed in my career field that I have spent most of my life very passionately living in.

In November 2020, I committed to a college in my home state (insane New England state) with an athletic scholarship. In May 2021, they announced that the vaccine was required.

The school didn’t begin accepting exemptions until late July, and I didn’t get an answer back until early August, only 3 weeks before move in date. 

They declined my religious exemption. I had to toss my $30,000 athletic scholarship down the drain, for a sport I love dearly and have lived and breathed my entire life. 

I had to explain to my coaches, future teammates, and everyone I knew that I wasn’t attending this school anymore. It was extremely humiliating, and lead me to avoid people so I wouldn’t have to break the news. Only a very small handful of people in my life knew the full truth about why I was no longer going to attend, and they all supported me 100%. I wasn’t willing to risk losing everyone else in my life over this though.

Because I didn’t hear back until August, I had no time to apply to other schools and explore my options. They definitely did this on purpose, they wanted to “trap” students with denied exemptions into getting the vaccine last minute so they could attend. This wasn’t going to happen for me, this is a hill I’m going to die on. I’m NEVER EVER getting that vaccine. 

Days later, a very close friend of 7 years essentially cut me off because of stuff related to the vaccine and all of this insanity. I have basically no friends now as everyone is busy with college and in a new chapter of their lives. I’m taking online classes and hoping to transfer to a school without vax mandates in Florida, although the chances of this are really slim.

This entire situation has made me feel very depressed, lonely, and isolated. Losing almost everything has made me lose motivation in school, as I’ve been too depressed to stay on top of my schoolwork. My grades are suffering, so I’m most likely never going to get into that Florida school. I’m never going to be able to live my dream as Division 1 athlete as I’ve destroyed my future by almost failing out of this semester of online classes. 

I could be getting amazing grades, making new friends, and living this dream. Instead, I’m spending my days at home completely isolated. I’d rather have no future and nothing to look forward to in life than give into these sick, disgusting, and tyrannical mandates. If it weren’t for the most important people in my life being against all of this as well, I don’t know what I’d do. I’d rather give up everything than give in.

Senator McConnell also blamed misinformation for the low rates of COVID-19 vaccination among Americans, which are fueling a rise in coronavirus cases, particularly in Republican-dominated states.

Some private sectors are offering incentives or declaring mandates for its employees; Even some universities have joined hands. Auburn university is giving $1,000 scholarships, prime parking and other prizes to fully vaccinated students.

The Biden administration is also imposing restrictions with respect to vaccination requirements for federal employees, \[both civilian and military\].  Thursday President Biden called on state and local governments to use funds from his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to offer $100 payments to individuals in order to incentivize coronavirus vaccinations. 

Additionally, Biden in his remarks Thursday afternoon announced that the federal government will mandate that its employees get vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to frequent testing. He referred to Kroger's \[a supermarket in some states\] that offered its employees $100 incentive and encouraged other supermarkets to do the same, including giving time off. 

Significant political figures and media outlets, however, largely reject need for vaccination or even mask mandates. Former president Trump has remained silent and many commentator \[though not all\], continue to minimize the dangers of COVID infection and death.

Tracking looked at deaths per 100,000 people in roughly 3,000 counties across the U.S. from May 2021, the point at which vaccinations widely became available. People living in counties that went 60% or higher for Trump in November 2020 had 2.7 times the death rates of those that went for Biden. Counties with an even higher share of the vote for Trump saw higher COVID-19 mortality rates.

In October, the reddest tenth of the country saw death rates that were six times higher than the bluest tenth, according to Charles Gaba, an independent health care analyst who's been[ tracking partisanship trends during the pandemic](https://acasignups.net/21/12/02/weekly-update-covid19-casedeath-rates-county-partisan-lean-vaccination-rate) and helped to review NPR's methodology. Those numbers have dropped slightly in recent weeks, Gaba says: ""It's back down to around 5.5 times higher.""

The analysis only looked at the geographic location of COVID-19 deaths. The exact political views of each person taken by the disease remains unknowable. But the strength of the association, combined with polling information about vaccination, strongly suggests that Republicans are being disproportionately affected.

Recent polling data that show [Republicans are now the largest group of unvaccinated individuals](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/importance-of-partisanship-predicting-vaccination-status/) in the United States, more than any other single demographic group.

The Biden administration defends the loan forgiveness program, citing in particular the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. This authorizes the Department of Education to forgive the student loans of some borrowers who are at risk of default because of a ""war, military operation, or national emergency."" COVID-19, the administration argues, is a qualifying national emergency under the statute, as it was formally declared a national emergency by then-President Trump, and, subsequently, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos invoked the HEROES Act when pausing loan repayments early in the pandemic. The Biden administration argues that the need to mitigate the financial hardship caused by the pandemic has not gone away. 

Biden's plan would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and $10,000 for other borrowers, for people earning up to $125,000 a year or part of a household where total earnings are no more than $250,000.

A federal judge in [Missouri dismissed the states' request](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/20/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-lawsuit-gop-states-dismissed/10556660002/) to block the program in October, ruling that they lacked standing to sue. While their case presented ""important and significant challenges to the debt relief plan,"" the trial court ruled, ""the current plaintiffs are unable to proceed."" On appeal, the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit [sided with the states' request to temporarily halt the program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/14/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-blocked-appeals-court-puts-plan-hold/10592105002/).

Those decisions follow a yearslong push by conservatives to curb the ""administrative state."" They argue federal agencies should have less power to act unless there's clear congressional approval.

Idaho's Governor, Brad Little (R), is currently visiting the Texas border. While the Governor is away, the Lt. Governor, Janice McGeachin (R), has named herself Acting Governor, and inquired of the state's Adjutant General about the steps it would take for her to send the Idaho National Guard to the US southern border.

That's wild enough, but in her own words, she also went on to edit the Governor's executive order on vaccine passports and mandatory testing. Eight minutes later, the Governor tweeted that she didn't have the authority, and that he would be rescinding all orders signed in his absence.

As far as I can tell, Idaho's Constitution does say she's Acting Governor whenever the Governor is away, but is there any precedent for actively going against the will of the Governor as soon as he crosses the state line?

Edit to add the following from the Idaho Statesman:

> Was this instance of an executive order legal?

> Probably not. Following McGeachin's March attempt, Rep. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, requested that the Idaho Attorney General's Office clarify the legality of McGeachin's actions. Deputy Attorney General Brian Kane wrote a detailed letter in response.

> Under state law, school district trustees, cities, counties and public health districts have the power to determine policies to protect public health. State law also prohibits executive orders from changing state law.

> Kane wrote that her March order was not legal. He said ""the statute makes clear that an executive order can only be issued to ensure 'that the laws are faithfully executed.'"" He also pointed out that it encroached ""upon the express statutory authority of local government entities,"" including school districts.

12 . Bigger push on monoclonal antibodies, more support for small businesses affected.

Biden & the Democrats campaigned on “beating the virus.” ( [https://joebiden.com/beat-covid19/](https://joebiden.com/beat-covid19/) ) In 2020, multiple Democratic governors instituted lockdowns (aka shelter-at-home orders.) Last year, as vaccinations became available, they moved away from lockdowns and switched to vaccine passports (requiring private businesses to check immunization records before allowing entry) & vaccine mandates (requiring government workers, then private employers, to require vaccinations.)  
Coming into 2022, Democrats’ primary strategy appears to be doubling down on vaccinations, especially booster shots / third doses which were recently approved by the FDA.

But is this a sustainable strategy going forward? While many Americans are willing to get a shot or two or three (I got mine last week), there may be increasing resistance to indefinite semiannual/annual shots for the foreseeable future, especially if mandated. And mandates are being hit with legal challenges - there’s a certain percentage of Americans who refuse to even get their FIRST shots. It’s also not a certainty the FDA will approve further booster shots.

In contrast, since last year or even late 2020, Republicans have mostly begun shifting their messaging to “this virus is endemic, so we should learn to live with it, minimize economic disruption, and avoid eroding personal freedoms.”

Of course, there are plenty of possible scenarios where the situation could end favorably for Democrats. The virus could mutate into far less deadly variants or even dissipate altogether, and this discussion would be moot. But imagine the virus doesn’t go away, and this coming spring/summer, there’s a new variant tearing across the country. What do Democrats do next: mandate a fourth shot?",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

The CDC has also requested that states waive requirements for applications for the distribution facilities that would prevent the facilities from being fully operational by November 1st, but that these waivers will not compromise the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. 

They have estimated 2 million doses by the end of October, 10 to 20 million doses by the end of November. The vaccines would be distributed to healthcare workers and other high-risk groups first.

To be clear, this is about the ***vaccine passports***, not vaccines in general. Conversations about this tend to be fairly charged, which isn't helped by the fact that ""vaccine passports"" are not a single thing, but rather a number of different proposals which vary in terms of the institution implementing them, what actions are restricted, used only at entry points or within borders, how long they will last, etc.

In the US, some states such as New York [have introduced voluntary vaccine passports](https://www.pcmag.com/news/new-york-launches-first-digital-covid-19-vaccine-passport) for gaining entry to stadiums, theaters, and other large venues, while other governors such as Texas' Abbot [have signed executing orders ""banning"" vaccine passports](https://www.startribune.com/texas-governor-bans-mandated-covid-19-vaccine-passports/600042837/).

Internationally, UK [is set to test vaccine passports](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/04/06/uk-loosen-covid-lockdown-starting-april-12-test-vaccine-passports/7103285002/), Israel [has already implemented them in some situations](https://news.yahoo.com/israel-rolls-vaccine-passport-system-162215497.html), and China [has vaccine certifications for cross-border travel.](https://globalnews.ca/news/7685366/covid-vaccine-passport-china/). (Chinese government officials also appear to be lobbying WHO to help [implement an international program](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202103/1217876.shtml).)


*** 

###Reasons for Vaccine Passports

* Decrease the risk of spreading Covid between countries
* Decrease the risk of spreading Covid within countries (in the case of VPs being required for entry to theaters, gyms, etc.)
* Increase tourism by allowing vaccinated people to travel and to feel safe traveling
* Increase internal economic activity by opening more locations, increasing capacity, and presumably increasing the perception of safety

The reasons against vaccine passports are less straight-forward: some apply only to certain implementations, and some will presumably not be relevant in the future. I'm going to break these down by practical objections and philosophical objections. This isn't necessarily a clear-cut distinction, but practical objections could be conceivably be overcome by some technological innovation, whereas philosophical ones cannot. *Me listing these objections does not mean I necessarily agree with them.*

###Practical objections:

* Uncertainty of effectiveness of vaccines to stop transmission: [WHO has cited this as reason they oppose mandatory VPs for intl. travel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-vaccines-idUSKBN2BT158)
* Inequitable access: not everyone has access to vaccines, so VPs would discriminate against poorer people and countries
* Medical conditions: some people have conditions which could make vaccination risky, and could presumably be discriminated against
* Privacy/data theft: The company or government implementing VPs could either maliciously or negligently allow private data to be used against participants
* No long-term safety data: While the safety trials look promising, we simply have no data past ~12 months. (Already, [EMA has linked AstraZeneca with blood clots.]
(https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersComService_2_MOLT/idUSKBN2BT1ER))
* No FDA approval for vaccines: In the US at least, the vaccines have only been given emergency use authorization (I think this holds internationally, but don't know)

###Philosophical objections:

* Turns rights into privileges: more relevant for in-country VPs, things which were once considered rights would now be conditioned
* Coercive medical intervention: If a person must take a vaccine to exercise what would otherwise be their right, the notion of ""informed consent"" becomes murky.
* Increased surveillance: Especially if tied to smartphones, VPs would limit the ability of people not to be surveilled by governments and corporations.
* Expansion of government/corporate power in general: Some are opposed to any more regulatory authority.
* Slippery slope: If VPs are normalized, it would decrease a barrier for other restrictions on liberties based on compliance with government policy, or the development of ""social credit"" systems like in China
* Opposition to vaccines and/or pharma in general: This would include across-the-board anti-vaxxers.

I think that's a fairly comprehensive list of the general arguments for and against vaccine passports, but if I missed any of the major ones I'll add it to the OP. (I listed more arguments against than for, but because the arguments for are generally well-understood and accepted by those who advocate VPs, while those against VPs have a broader range of reasons they object.)",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

Covid has had a substantial affect on the world in the last couple of years. With a new, more infectious ""Variant of Interest"" (omicron) \[defined by WHO as having one or more of the following characteristics;  

* increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR
* increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR
* decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics\]

a question arises pertaining to the ethics of mandated vaccination.

Governments over the world had/have implemented legal mandates in response to the Covid virus, ranging from businesses being shut down to restricted travel, to required testing, to mandated rent reductions while people could not travel to work.

In a similar vain, subnational organisations, such as schools and hospitals, have mandated that their students and employees respectively, receive a vaccination in order to physically attend.

Recently, Austria has become the first European country to make receiving a vaccine mandatory (with medical exemptions) on pain of administrative fines and potentially prison time if the fines are not paid. ([Link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/19/austria-plans-compulsory-covid-vaccination-for-all) as per Rule 2.)

Is it ethically justifiable for a government to make people undergo medical procedures under threat of fine or prison, if it is in the name of reducing casualties?

Is such a mandate necessary in countries with high vaccination rates?

Are there better ways to ensure wider immunisation than punitive measures?

For example, journalist Maryn McKenna explores this connection in [her 2019 New Republic piece](https://newrepublic.com/article/153264/rise-right-wing-nationalism-jeopardizing-world-health) that has come to renewed relevance considering recent calls for a more engaged multilateral public health framework.

Anyway, one part of the modern culture wars that I feel like hasn't garnered a lot of discussion in the wake of the various ""anti-woke""/""Don't Say Gay"" bills over the last two years has been the expectation that the parent's role in the child's life has become more all-encompassing than it was a generation or two ago.

Likewise, [this year has seen a major rise in ""parent's rights"" groups pushing for book bans to be enacted in schools, particularly on works with a focus on race or sexuality](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/), limiting the ability of students to exercise autonomy in educating themselves on topics their parents may disapprove of. So where should we draw the line on where the authority of a parent to raise their children in a manner they see fit ends?

These bills also empower parents to be informed on changes to their students lives in school without the approval of the student. To quote [the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/er/PDF):

>In accordance with the rights of parents enumerated in ss. 1002.20 and 1014.04, adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and the school's ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The procedures must reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children by requiring school district personnel to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with the parent. The procedures may not prohibit parents from accessing any of their student's education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school district, as required by s. 1002.22(2). 

This is often cited by critics as *requiring* teachers to out LGBT students that may have confided in them to their parents, though particularly with regards to trans students using a different name and gender than they were enrolled under. Because the bill also empowers parents to threaten schools with legal action if staff members refuse to comply, then the students can no longer trust teachers or counselors to be adult confidants they can turn to outside of their family, cutting off an arm of social support that students have had access to in the past. How much should a parent be able to know about their children versus how much privacy and autonomy should a child be able to have?

And this isn't just limited to schools, the medical rights of children are also largely left in the hands of parents to decide. This isn't particularly new, [there have been multiple cases of children dying preventable deaths of illnesses that could have been treated if not for the religious objections of the parents](http://childrenshealthcare.org/?page_id=132) for over a century, from Christian Science to Jehovah's Witnesses to Orthodox Judaism.

Similarly, while the last decade has seen significant progress to [have conversion therapy for minors labeled as child abuse and banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy), it still remains legal in half of the country. In all of those cases, the parents aren't the ones who have to live with the consequence of the decisions they make on behalf of their child, the child is. So how much should _their_ opinions weigh in on what they want to have done with their health and their bodies?

""[Think of the children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3D8670smTI)"" action is [nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_trial), but the new framing of the issue has in some ways moved away from ""protecting children"" and more around ""parents' rights"", and that raises the question for me of how far those rights _should_ extend. No one likes the idea of the government telling families how to raise their kids because parents are, ostensibly, acting in what they consider to be the best interests of their children, and no way to raise a child is one-size-fits-all. You can even make good faith arguments to Left-leaning parents that these expansions of parental rights _can_ be used to monitor their children and allow for interventions to protect their kids if they show signs of self-harm, or radicalization, or sexual exploitation, which makes the argument of expanded parental rights appealing to them too. Yet as parental oversight has expanded since the days of ""Stranger Danger"" and away from the free-range ([sometimes _actually dangerous_](https://www.generations.com/insights/gen-x-on-the-edge-surviving-childhood)) childhoods of older Millennials and Gen Xers, we're seeing [concerning rates of mental health issues](https://healthmatch.io/blog/the-gen-z-mental-health-wave-what-is-causing-the-surge) among Gen Z that may be tied to [growing up in environments dominated by helicopter parents and limited in personal autonomy that weakens their emotional resiliency](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60624/young-adults-are-struggling-with-their-mental-health-is-more-childhood-independence-the-answer). So where do we draw the lines on where a parent's control over their child ends and a child becomes an autonomous person with their own rights? How do we as a culture get parents to build trust with their children and relax control over their lives? Is that something we even should be doing, or should parents be able to shape their child's life around their personal beliefs?

Not everything that happens in the world is the president’s fault. Sometimes you are given a bad hand of cards, and you do the best you can do with those cards. 

Let’s take a look at the three overarching issues that have led to the cratered approval ratings of this administration: economy, pandemic, and war. 

The Trump administration, however you may feel about Trump, have enjoyed historic economic gains. Of course, these gains cannot be sustainable forever. As fast as the economy shoots up, it’s destined to come back down. Anyone, even if it were Trump in office now, would see these historic inflations.  Because historic gains lead to historic inflations, and we have a recession about every 10 years in this country. So how has the Biden admin dealt with this issue? Biden has sent out money to everyone to help stimulate the economy and is currently raising interest rates to slow down inflation, while also being careful as to not crumble the economy. 

Secondly, we have Covid. That’s an unforeseen and frankly, unstoppable, pandemic that could have happened no matter who’s in office. Again, we must look to how this administration has reacted to it. The Biden admin distributed testing and vaccines nationwide, at record volumes and record speed. But viruses, as viruses naturally do, have mutated and now we have various forms of Covid to deal with. This pandemic is an ongoing problem that we’ll probably wrestle with in some form for the next decade. 

Finally, we have war. Russia decides to attack Ukraine and the world has to figure out how to deal with this. Fighting back with troops is out of the question, since no one in their right mind wants world war 3. Short from war, Biden and his European allies have done everything else. Give weapons to Ukraine? Check. Sanction Russia? Check. It’s so severe that the Russian economy is crumbling before our eyes, and innocent Russian people are suffering. But this was a a sacrifice that needed to be made to respond to Putin. 

So, that leads us, to why the Biden administration sees itself with terribly low approval ratings. Is it because the Biden admin hasn’t been public enough touting their own efforts and achievements?  Is it because after all of this, the public still doesn’t feel like the Biden admin hasn’t done enough? Is it because no one knows or cares about what the Biden admin has done, but seeing food and gas prices as historically high prices is enough to lose confidence in this administration?

If distrust in the American institutions ever reached levels that are as low as Russian levels are, the ruling American president at that time would surely be kicked out of office or impeached, not be continually re-elected (and yes I am fully aware that the Russian elections aren't exactly fair or free) with a 70% approval rating.",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

I can't think of any argument they give against the COVID vaccine that doesn't apply to the flu vaccine.  The COVID vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of people with next to zero adverse reactions, so it's more thoroughly tested than any flu vaccine.  If the government is capable of putting monitoring chips, or mind control, or the mark of the beast in COVID vaccine, it's capable of doing the same with flu vaccine.  And so on.

38,Questions About Federal Funding and Planned Parenthood,70.0,5p15jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5p15jy/questions_about_federal_funding_and_planned/,155.0,1484878308.0,"Hi all, college age girl speaking. 

I see a lot of people on Facebook arguing that no tax money goes toward funding abortion (except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the mother), and therefore defunding planned parenthood would really just be depriving millions of women of non-abortion related health care services (like contraception, physical exams, vaccines, screenings for conditions like STDs/anemia/diabetes/high blood pressure, etc.). 

But at the same time, Planned Parenthood received more than 40 percent of their total revenue from the government (based on 2015 numbers), which they presumably need in order to function. Now I understand that they can't use that funding on abortion, but they are the biggest abortion provider in the U.S. So if the government ceased to provide that funding then PP parenthood clinics, and therefore a large number of abortion clinics, would presumably close.

It seems like the reason Congress wants to withdraw funding from PP isn't because they want to deprive people of access to basic healthcare, but because PP is an abortion provider. Pro-lifers feel that by keeping PP in business, the government is keeping abortion clinics open. But hypothetically, couldn't PP physically move its abortion services into separate clinics and say ""there, the clinics the government is funding are independent and only provide non-abortion related health care services"" and resolve the issue at the center of the debate? It just doesn't make sense to have all of those non-abortion related healthcare services disappear because they're seen as a package deal with abortion...

Also to be clear, I am not in favor of outlawing abortion or making abortion difficult to obtain. If my contraception failed and I became pregnant I would definitely seek out an abortion. It's a decision I never want to have to make, and my heart goes out to anyone in that position.

However, the era of Covid has now left me wondering, has the pendulum swung back to the left?

In the past two years, I think we may have reason to believe this is the case. In the US, Biden defeated the populist right president, Trump who was roundly condemned for his Covid response. In Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, and Chile, socialists have all been elected president. Whilst in Germany and Norway, Social democratic parties have won their first election in over a decade. 

Whilst this is true, center-left parties have also won reelection too. In some cases, landslides have been seen in Portugal, South Korea, New Zealand, and Canada. 

By comparison, comparatively few examples can be found of right-wing parties winning in this environment. Two examples include the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, however, this is mitigated by the fact, both already had incumbent right-wing governments prior to their elections. Additionally, center-left parties appear poised for victory in Brazil and Australia this year.

If true, some possible reasons could include the following. Firstly the fact right-wing governments due to having the incumbency, may be more likely to face consequences from the Covid-recession. Secondly, the the fact people are now facing increasingly dire economic circumstances may mean they vote for parties that offer more social and economic support. 

Thirdly, unpopular positions in this political environment such as vaccine hesitancy are increasingly associated with political right. And fourthly, for some, the fallout from Covid may have radicalized to the left as it revealed the broken nature of many ""Capitalist"" institutions.

Currently, to save more lives many countries are closing schools, putting cities into full lockdown/quarantine, and cancelling mass gatherings of people. This should help reduce the strain on healthcare systems and minimize the number of direct and indirect deaths due to the virus. However, this strategy will likely prolong the amount of time the virus is spreading throughout the global population. Until a majority of the population in each country has caught the virus and there is some level of herd immunity or vaccine, this pandemic could keep hitting in waves over the course of the next year or so. The appropriate health response in each wave will be to limit social contact, which means there could be repeated closures, cancellations and quarantines over the next year. This will greatly damage global economic output. It’s crass to talk about economics when people are sick and dying, but our modern life does depend on the economy continuing to function. 

From an economic policy standpoint, if governments ignored the pandemic and allowed the virus to rip through each country unhindered, the economic impact of the virus would probably be shorter-lived and more limited in scope. The death-toll would, of course, be astronomically higher, but economic activity across the globe could return to normal perhaps twice as fast and the overall damage to output could perhaps be shortened.

The main reason why they theorized that no war would occur (in the near future, at least) was because either the US’s economy was too dependent on China’s, vice versa, or both. Alternatively reasoned, China wouldn’t want to face sanctions and the ramifications of a hostile takeover of Taiwan.

In the past week alone, however, we have seen enough degradation in the US-China relationship and other, relevant international political events to raise some large, red flags:

- [The US-China meeting in Alaska ending in a glorified screaming match](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitter-alaska-meeting-complicates-already-shaky-u-s-china-ties-11616185669), where China said that the US does not “have the power” to contest Chinese interests.

These events I’ve listed aren’t even the full extent of the relationship, as there have been far more large, precarious, and dangerous events that have occurred in the past to damage US-Chinese relations, like Canada’s imprisonment of Meng Wenzhou, Chinese foreign officials in many countries being caught for spying, and the Chinese-US Houston consulate spat, to name a few. I’m sure that more significant events will occur in the future, given both countries’ disdain for the other continues to become clearer and grows.

We already know the anti-Chinese stance is a bipartisan stance even in the deeply partisan US, and also in the EU. This is far from the first time we’ve seen aggressive foreign policies and announcements from China, but President Biden’s stance has been unexpectedly hardline.

So if you rewind 10 years back, the biggest talking point among the right-wing circles was how Muslims were the number one enemy of the United States, how ""Shariah Law"" was going to be implemented in America, Muslim immigrants were seen as a big problem, people like Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller were prominent. The so-called ""Ground Zero Mosque"" was a big dividing point among Americans. This hatred against Muslims really entered popular consciousness around 9/11 and then peaked around 2012 plateauing into the rise of Trump and the War against ISIS. 

But today, it seems that Muslims are no longer a talking point among the right-wing Americans. Instead their attention has turned against ""Liberals"" as a whole, against things like critical race theory, transgender controversies, gender ideologies, LGBT stuff. The right-wing echo chambers and talking heads focus entirely on how evil Biden and the Democrats are. There is continued hatred of Muslims but it gets subsumed into a wider hatred and disdain of immigrants as a whole I've noticed. 

This is probably attributed to a few things. The rapid and easy defeat of ISIS probably showed most Americans that radical Islam could never pose a threat to the United States. The New Zealand Mosque Shootings probably made some people realize they've gone too far with their talking points. And the political polarization in America reached such extreme levels that the right-wing stopped caring about Muslims. COVID may have also played a role where it was a massive global event that took attention away from 20 years of news focusing on radical Islamic terrorists, and the right-wing focused their attention on fighting mask and vaccine mandates instead. Plus America no longer being involved in Iraq or Afghanistan and the news cycle eager to move on from those topics.

Adding on to this dynamic, in California, governor Gavin Newsom is facing a likely recall election, and with teachers unions being among his and the Democratic Party’s strongest allies, he has little political power to “fight back” against the union’s demands.

In this interview, Trump says the following:

>""Oh no, the vaccines work, but some people aren’t the ones. The ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine. But it’s still their choice. And if you take the vaccine, you’re protected,”

* will this action cause his base to turn on him?
* what could his motivation be for speaking positively on the booster knowing his base has embraced anti-vaccine sentiment?
* how does this change the narrative for democrats and liberals who feel the former president hasn't done enough to encourage vaccination for his supporters?

The Mass media seem to focus on certain protests and ignore others. The protests they tend to focus on are ones that are in line with the foreign policy interests of the United States government and the ones that get less attention are ones that either the US has no interests in or are actively not in favor of. Why did the protests that happened recently in Haiti or Colombia get ignored but others got plenty of attention?

**Edit:**

 I'm seeing a lot of the same responses of people saying basically that ""the news media is just meeting demand"".

But how could this be the case how exactly would the news media know what protests would be in demand before they even happen. The protests happen all around the world and are about different things.

if they are just meeting demand how do you explain the very real trend in favor of coverage of protests that the US government is in favor of.

Like take these examples for instance.

Coverage of the 2019-2020 protests of Iraq vs Iran.


The Iraq protests were  of a very large size and they were calling out things like State corruption, Unemployment, low wages as well as calling for an end to the US occupation of the country. They were met with severe state repression many protesters were killed by the government. The protests eventually called for the overthrow of the government of Iraq.


The protests in Iran were against Government corruption, Increase in fuel prices, Human rights Abuses, and opposition to the theocracy. They were also met with severe state repression and many protesters were killed by the government. The protests eventually called for the overthrow of the Iranian government.

The two protest movements were calling for much the same thing and These protests were going on at about the same time. The main difference is that the protests in Iraq were against the foreign policy interests of the US government and In Iran the US government was trying to do Regime change in the country.

The main stream media covered Iran far more then Iraq. The protests in Iraq were back page news but the Iranian protests were front page news.

Or that another example. the example of the main stream media coverage of the protests in Myanmar vs Haiti.

Both these protests were pro democracy movements fighting against an authoritarian government but the US was in favor of one movement (Myanmar) and against the other (Haiti).

The protests in Haiti were fighting against the authoritarian rule of the now dead President of Haiti Jovenel Moïse. Who illegally stayed one year past the time he was supposed to step down as President and have new elections. Jovenel Moïse. Ruled by decree for a whole year Haiti was effectively a dictatorship during that time. The US government supported Jovenel Moïse's clam to be the president of the country and didn't call out his Hunan rights violations.


The protests in Myanmar were fighting against a coup by the military against an elected government. The military claimed the elections to be rigged without any evidence and did and illegal coup against a newly elected government. The US denounced the coup and called for the military to respect democracy in the country.

It seems very unlikely to me that the media is just meeting demand for certain things as these news stories are very similar to each other and you would think that demand would be similar as well. 

When the US government is in favor of a protest movement the main stream media coverage of the events are more frequent but when the US government is against a protest movement (or neutral) the coverage is vary little or something even almost non existent.

It seems very unlikely that the mass media is just meeting demand because many of these events are very similar and you would think that the public would like both things to be covered. But they are not equally covered but it does seem like the mainstream media covers things when there are in the interests of the US governments foreign policy agenda.

73,On the impact Brexit might be having on the process of European unification,8.0,nup3sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/nup3sn/on_the_impact_brexit_might_be_having_on_the/,4.0,1623103877.0,"Brexit has been, and is being, one of those political events whose ramification will stretch far ahead in the future. The events which led to the United Kingdom eventually leaving the EU and the whole negotiations process have been thoroughly discussed here and elsewhere, so this is not my goal with this post. It is meaningful to mention, however, how the European Union, while always having the sharp end of the knife, has never actually pushed nor wished for Brexit to happen, leaving the UK all the time they asked for and offering fair conditions. Not once the right the UK had to leave the Union has been questioned nor obstructed, despite sailing in unexplored waters and under the threat of starting a domino effect propelled by populists having gained maximum momentum at the time.

In theory, there were good grounds to expect that the withdrawal of one member could have increased the probability of others leaving. An exit that would have provided similar benefits as those granted by regional integration but with fewer constraints, might very well have tempted more countries. Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier explained how the EU indented to deal with this matter in 2017, when he presented the [stairway model](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-options/stairway-to-brexit-barnier-maps-out-uks-canadian-path-idUKKBN1ED23R?edition-redirect=uk) for European trading relationships. Nevertheless, the willingness of the other EU governments to remain united in the negotiations could not have been taken for granted and the extent to which Brexit could have triggered a domino effect very much depended on the outcome of Article 50 negotiations, which were destined to set the benchmark for what a leaving member could or could not expect to gain. Support for leaving the EU reflected how voters thought their country could stand in a similar situation, which in turn depended on how they rated their national economic or political strength. This helps to explain the paradox of greater electoral support for Euroskeptic parties in prosperous countries such as Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK itself.

But that was before the actual Brexit process, before the infinite Parliament sessions, before all the delays, before COVID. All those things have affected the European population's attitude towards the EU, and citizens have, on average, a greater understanding of what it means to live in a single market where capital, goods, services, and people are able to move freely across national borders . The populist agenda of getting a better deal outside the EU than as a member state was most believable in the absence of any formal exit talks. The confidence with which Brexit was promoted was linked to confidence in getting a “better deal” as a third country, and the UK approach was to use the prospect of an unwanted disorderly exit to extract concessions. The EU nonetheless never offered a compromise that might have weakened its integrity. These moves resulted in leading both sides to publicly prepare for a no deal outcome, thus showcasing to many Europeans the inherent difficulties of accepting the trade-offs that come from leaving the EU. Risk aversion thus explains the lack of a Brexit domino effect, and the 2019 elections confirm this theory.

The pandemic has then created a situation in which the pros and cons of responding alone to a crisis can be immediately tested. On one hand, the EU has shown not to be able to immediately react, tied to a mechanism which is clearly not suited for day to day decision making, and the UK has started the vaccine campaign months in advance with respect to EU-27. On the other hand, London might pay dearly the exclusion from the NextGenerationEU plan, not to mention the much higher level of travel restrictions British citizens are experiencing right now.

The recovery plan is a very big deal, if not for the amount of money involved, for the way this money will be financed. The EU has decided to share a large part of Covid induced debt, and the degree of this sharing is unprecedented. It entails a very large increase in the purchase of national sovereign securities by the ECB and, most importantly, the issue of common debt on global markets (the eurobonds) used to finance loans and subsidies for member states to be used with aims and in ways jointly designed at the community level.  This could turn out to be the first step towards a permanent increase in the size of the EU budget, and a regular supply of eurobonds for the financial markets could enhance the international role of the euro and of EU capital markets. 

The point at discussion is the correlation between this newly found, and crisis induced, EU momentum and the departure of its historically most skeptical member. Mind that correlation does not mean neither induces causation, and is indented as a purely statistical term. More on Britain's behavior inside the European Union can be found [here](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/1752/1/U188014.pdf), but it's safe to assert that the UK has often pushed back the process of further political European integration. The Union is now free of the constrain this represented, and how much better, or worse, European economy will be compared to the UK in the years to come might determine an even greater wish to share financial sovereignty. Furthermore, the EU represents a unique political entity, which pushes the boundaries between a federation and a confederation, and which has now shown to withstand both entry and exit. 

Do you think Brexit will benefit or threaten the idea of a united Europe in the years to come? Do you think that NextGenEU and eurobonds would have happened as well with the UK?  Will the post pandemic situation give new life to euroskepticism and populism or drag it underwater? How much better or worse can the UK expect to perform post covid?

76,"A question on the Paradox of data collection and vulnerability (specifically by the gov, though it applies beyond that as well).",7.0,okgoy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/okgoy8/a_question_on_the_paradox_of_data_collection_and/,12.0,1626306193.0,"When the government collects data, it has risks and rewards. In some cases, for the most part, the US government and the population at large has accepted the risk relative to the reward. Example:

Government Housing Standard Regulations.

The government evaluates many properties to keep them up to code. It keeps those who live there safe in the long run, and tells them what places are having code issues.

There is a risk that said database of code violations could be used against the buildings which are still working to get up to code. But this risk is usually considered so small as to be insignificant.

The risk occurs both by the Government gathering the data, but also if said data is insecure, how it could be used by outsiders with malicious intent. Further, even if the government is currently using the data carefully, a future government could re-purpose said data for political uses that might harm those who were intended to be helped by the database.

An example of one which, I think, most of society would agree the risk relative to the reward is way too high to be used in any casual manner by government agencies:

A listing of ethnic background of individuals and where they are located.

Such a listing could be argued to be useful for government agencies when it came to protecting said minorities from being targeted by hostile groups, to offer those locations greater services pursuant to that group's needs.

The risk, however, of a future government using that data to target specific individuals, or for an outside entity with malicious intent gaining access to that data, is such that such information is not 'casually' collected by the government.

However, the government obviously collects said data with the Census. The data from the Census, however, has some of the greatest security of any database ever taken and can only be released 'in aggregate'. This still poses some risk, but to a far smaller degree.

For an example of one that could be seen as controversial: Vaccine data.

Knowing where people who were unvaccinated lived could allow the government to put larger services in those areas in case of outbreaks or to increase efforts in the area to increase voluntary vaccination.

In some ways, the government has an aggregate form of this simply through keeping track of it's distribution efforts. But once again, the aggregate is far less risky.

But a theoretical door-to-door listing of who is and isn't vaccinated could allow for a future government to know who to look for to force vaccinations. If said data got loose, if in the hands of a foreign power, they could know where to strike with biological warfare, for example.

Another example: Gun ownership

If the government had a database on every gun, it could theoretically provide greater service regarding guns for those areas, be it free lessons in safety or more accessibility to gun permits.

The risk which is most often stated is that a future government agency could use said database to confiscate those guns. If the data was compromised, it would also tell those who intend to steal guns exactly where to go to get them.

A mixed possibility, which can be seen as risk or reward depending on the circumstances, would be that law enforcement could better know the risks at any particular household and what to be aware of.

And, of course, the concept of privacy plays a role.

A government finding it's own vulnerabilities could use it to address it to correct said vulnerabilities, but also acts as a database for malicious external groups to use those vulnerabilities.

Gathering the data can make things better, but also make things worse.

How do you draw the line? If your perspective was slightly different, how would that change where you drew the line? (As in, if I had more faith in the security of the system, would that shift things)

Perhaps much of the paradox comes from the fact that 'data' is too large a category and each category has a different line, in which case, how do you delineate the categories?

This post is typed from the perspective of the US, however its a far more general question and I'd love to hear if/how you might think that the line drawn elsewhere should be drawn differently where you are.

[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ali-a-rizvi/the-phobia-of-being-calle_b_5215218.html) one, to be specific, and I was musing. I was thinking, ""This guy sounds pretty reasonable, on the other hand, I want to be careful to respect Person X' right to be a Muslim. Long and short, I was trying to think up some universal formula, or list, for rights, the natural, inalienable, hardcore rights kind of rights.



Part 1
I was thinking along these lines: This list of rights should apply to every human. It should be as long as possible, i.e. you should be able to do as many things as possible (Things you might do, just to clarify: believe in a God, love Justin Beiber, speak your mind, buy a pack of gum, study glassblowing, etc, etc). if I, as a government or just a hypothetical, want to take away a right of Person X, I should have a damn good reason. 


That said, there is one important caveat: You should only be able to make decisions and do things that pertain to you; your rights are not rights **over** somebody else. Put another way: you can do whatever you want only if you're the only one involved, otherwise, there are limitations. Pertaining to the article, I don't think it's reasonable that Person X' right to religious freedom should let him dictate what women in his family wear, or what I eat for brunch, or the playing of the Carmina Burana. 

Break.

Part 2
That said, I thought myself into a bit of a pickle. The article mentioned female genital mutilation (To be clear: I do not think this is a nice thing to do, and I do not think it equates in any way to circumcision of a penis.) At first, this seems to fit rather well into my thinking: FGM is something you may believe in, but it is not a right you have, because it involves someone else. 

But. I thought some more. I imagined Person X, with their infant child. Person X must, in order to be an effective parent, make some decisions for this child. For instance, Person X might wish to prevent the child from walking into traffic, breastfeed the child, or vaccinate the child. If the child is male, Person X might want to circumcise the child. If the child is female, Person X might want to practice FGM.

With the less rational part of my brain, I want Person X to be able to parent the child, stop them from walking into traffic, and vaccinate the child. I don't think circumcision is that big a deal. I think FGM is a very bad thing. There is some debate about vaccination, breastfeeding, etc. I want to reconcile the inability for the child to be a full, rational agent, with the idea that, when they are, they may not appreciate what their parent did. While the case of FGM seems very cut and dry, the intricacies around things like circumcision and even vaccination give me pause.

The question for this discussion will be: ""Should vaccines be mandatory?"" and follow-up questions could be: How many vaccines, for what specific diseases?

My thinking on the subject has changed over time. I used to be a proponent of mandatory vaccines, however I've grown more libertarian and I can no longer support forcing people to take drugs against their will - even if it's for their own good. What used to be black and white now seems like a grey area.

Just like any drug, vaccines are not 100% safe. In debates I have seen links to [SV40 virus contamination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40#Polio_vaccine_contamination) and the [original Swine Flu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak#Reported_vaccine_side_effects) vaccine causing neurodegenerative disease.

On the other side, proponents talk about [herd immunity theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) and expect that everyone who is able to receive the vaccination should do so.

Lastly, there are the manufacturers of the vaccines themselves. Let's not forget that this is big business and contracts to supply vaccines run into the billions of dollars, and vaccines like [pandemrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemrix) involved millions of doses at short notice. We have to keep in mind the obvious incentive for companies like GlaxoSmithKline to push as much of their product as possible, since their profits depend on it. Or just the fact that mistakes do happen, and by cutting corners in testing and QA, contaminated vaccines have made their way into patients in the past.

So what is your opinion? Should people be forced to take vaccines against their will? How about new vaccines that have yet to be tested? Is there a safe limit to the amount of vaccines that can be given at one time? What happens to the people who are injured from a vaccine? If there is a major flu pandemic, would you support giving everyone a dosage, even if it's yet to be proven?

Of course I'm approaching this from a devil's advocate point of view since most are in favor of making vaccines mandatory.

He's tough on immigration, but without the ""sending us their rapists"" dog whistling. Maybe he promises a wall, whether that's actually a good idea or not, because it's a simple, symbolic idea. But without the ""make Mexico pay for it"" nonsense. And with some acknowledgement that people overstaying visas at least as big a problem. Probably without a path to citizenship, but also without pretending that we're going to immediately deport over ten million people.

Our imaginary non-Trump departs from standard GOP rhetoric, like the real Trump, in not supporting cuts to social security and medicare. 

He has to be at least nominally pro-life to run as a Republican, but like the real Trump let's have him be ""soft"" on that issue.  On gay marriage too, he probably has to say ""traditional marriage"" in some approving way to hope to get the GOP nomination, but again can be ""soft"" in a way that tries to thread the needle of winning both GOP support and moderate/independent support.

He's pro-gun of course. That goes without saying. 

Health care is a tough one. The real Trump has supported single payer, then universal healthcare that isn't single payer, then Obamacare-lite with the pre-existing conditions regulations (and therefore a mandate), and most recently a standard sort of GOP position that is essentially a rollback to pre-Obamacare plus some cost cutting. 

Our non-Trump is running for the GOP nomination so where Trump ended up on health care is probably where our guy needs to start, or something close to that. Maybe also with something along the lines of: ""I will repeal Obamacare, but not in a way that hurts people. We will repeal Obamacare when we can replace it with something better and not before."" It's nonsense, but it's nonsense designed to let both sides imagine that it means what they want it to mean. Like I said, this is a tough issue. It's no surprise it's an issue that has gotten Trump so tangled up.

Our non-Trump, like the real Trump, has zero of the theocratic leanings of someone like Cruz. He can't be an atheist and have any hope of getting the GOP nomination, but like the real Trump he's not going to be any sort of evangelical. 

Needless to say, our non-Trump doesn't engage in petty twitter feuds. Doesn't insult other candidates left and right. Doesn't re-tweet white supremacist infographics. Isn't a birther. No vaccine pseudo-science.  Doesn't think climate change is a Chinese conspiracy. Not anti-science in general. Doesn't speak approvingly about committing war crimes. 

**Now here's the question.**

Is our imaginary Trump a *better* Trump-like candidate in terms of winning the GOP nomination and having a good shot at winning the general? Capable of attracting independents and moderates and disaffected Democrats even, while not alienating conservatives *too* much?

Or is this more reasonable Trump a dud?

One last thought: I've tried to describe a candidate that the real Trump *could have been*, at least in theory, although it implies far more self-control, and none of the thin-skinnedness, than the real Trump actually seems to have. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

My mother's a psychiatric nurse. We were talking about the Newton shooting, when I brought up this point.

I don't know what law is on the books regarding physical examinations (a.k.a. checkups, or doctor's visits) and schooling. Some schools require students to be up to date on vaccinations, participation in sports requires a doctor's note, and so on. However, this might be federal, state, or local; I'm not sure.

On the books or not, the vast majority of my peers that I've talked to get an annual checkup from a physician.

Meanwhile, an extremely select few have ever visited a psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist, or counselor even once in their lives.

Why is this so?

Shouldn't we value our mental health even more than our physical health? No longer are the children of America at risk of developing polio, few will contract something more serious than pertussis or meningitis during their schooling. But incidence of depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental health issues seem to be rising. This may, or may not have something to do with the rise of mass shootings, such as those in Columbine, Aurora, or today's in Newton.

If every child was examined psychologically as often as they are physically, I believe that incidence of mental health issues would decrease. 

Whether or not this would help would-be mass murderers sort out their issues and save countless lives, this would benefit countless children in other ways. When thoroughly examined, and subsequently prescribed medicine or scheduled for therapy and counseling, students with depression might not resort to self-harm or destructive behavior like so many of my friends have. 

If it's on the law books that students must get physically examined and vaccinated for schooling, I firmly believe that a psychological examination should be mandatory as well.

If annual checkups are just a cultural norm, I feel that more Americans ought to visit psychologists and psychiatrists as often as they do physicians. I'm asking my mother to schedule myself, my siblings, and her and my father for appointments with a local psychologist for basic evaluations, to take my own first steps.

94,What Republicans Really Care About ,0.0,10qcur,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10qcur/what_republicans_really_care_about/,0.0,1349045815.0,"An Editorial by Me

Republicans don’t like poor people. Or women. Or gays. Or immigrants. Or Muslims. Or minorities of any kind really. Let me clarify. By Republican, I mean Republican strategist or power broker or decider or Presidential candidate – not your rank and file Republicans. Because, shockingly, there are plenty of women and poor people and minorities and gays who check Republican on their ballots. 

Why don’t Republican elites like all of these groups? Well, it’s not so much that they don’t like them. It’s that they don’t care. 

Let me repeat that because it’s an important point: Republicans don’t care about women, or immigrants, or non-Christians, or minorities, or poor people, or gays. Even if you are one and vote for them. 

What the Republican elite love is money and power and holding on to both of those. The problem is that there aren’t a lot of rich white men left in this country. We can all see that rich white men are the primary group of Republican power brokers. And according to the 2010 census, their numbers are shrinking. So what Republicans have to do is keep the minorities and poor people busy with campaigns against gay marriage (It will ruin traditional marriage!), against unions (They are job killers!), against Planned Parenthood (They are baby killers!), against women (They have vaginas!). In fact, let’s all say it out loud: vagina. Vagina. VAGINA. Look around. Did your walls crumble? See the four horsemen? Locust plague on its way? I didn’t think so. But it’s ok to talk about the unborn – just not the passageway from which they emerge. Maybe if we referred to vaginas as if they were an up and coming neighborhood about to gentrify: ""Unborn Adjacent,"" they would be more palatable. But I digress. The reason the nation talked about vaginas, or Republicans’ inability to talk about them, after the Michigan legislature silencing: it distracted us from the economy. 

Republican strategists work silently and behind closed doors to ensure that this country and this world exist for one purpose: to increase shareholder value and fatten the pockets of themselves and their cronies. It’s what’s taught in every business school across the country. Everything else is a red herring for what Republicans really care about. 

Do you vote Republican because they claim to be pro-life? Guess what. Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital invested in a company that profited off of disposal of fetuses after abortions. And I know plenty of women who work at Planned Parenthood and will tell you they have seen the same women who protest outside of an abortion clinic waltz right in for an abortion at some point in their lives. One in three women gets an abortion by age 45, and they simply cannot all be Democrats. 

Do you vote Republican because they claim gays will kill traditional marriage? Well, the divorce rate among those who vote Republican is much higher than that of Democrats. Maybe it’s getting married too young and not having enough money that are the root causes of why marriages fail or not having anyone tell you that some partners can be controlling or rage-aholics - not that Rick and Steve got hitched on Cape Cod. Gay marriage is already happening and there’s been no discernible link to the failure rate of traditional marriages. Or maybe Kim Kardashian’s marriage failure is due to gays getting married. I could be wrong. 

Do you think you hate Obamacare? I hate to break it to you, but eventually we all rely on nationalized health care – it may have paid for vaccines you got as a baby, or those STD tests and treatment you got as a teen and didn’t want mom and dad to know about, or those 20 years of medical and nursing home care gramma got after granpa passed away. We’ve all seen the ridiculous protest sign: “Get your government hands off my Medicare!” The mind fairly boggles at the idiocy of such a statement. We spend the most money of any nation on health care and yet there are at least 30-odd nations whose health is better than ours. And the government runs the health care systems in almost ALL of those nations.

Do you rail against the idea that Obama said, “You didn’t build that” to small business owners? Well, if you read anything factual, you know that comment was taken out of context and has been exploded into a propaganda firestorm. But let’s consider a small restaurant owner. She needs to be sure her kitchen meets building code so the building doesn’t burn down (govt), she needs to pass inspection so her customers don’t get sick (govt), she needs to apply for loans so she can make all her purchases (govt backed banks), she needs to pay social security and taxes so that she can retire (govt), she needs the roads that lead to her restaurant so her customers can get to her place of business (govt). The list goes on. So sure, she may have built the restaurant, but without ANY of the government’s help, it probably wouldn’t have been possible. 

Republicans want their sheeple to be afraid of terrorists, mad at socialists, and then blame Democrats for everything. They want to whip them up into a frenzy about gay marriage, the “global terror threat”, abortion providers, and gun rights because they don’t want their constituents to realize at the very same time they are being lulled into a Valium sleep about the loss of high paying jobs with decent health insurance, the loss of unemployment benefits, the loss of women’s rights to equal pay, the loss of opportunities for minorities to participate in government by strict voter ID laws, and the loss of government control over money-making ventures like parking and property for unnecessary stadiums. 

Never in my life have I thought Democrats were perfect. They can be corrupt. They can be in the pocket of big business. They can vote for unnecessary wars and condone drone attacks on innocent people that result in more foreigners hating America rather than creating a safer America. They can create a health care law that allowed drug companies and insurance companies guaranteed profits rather than demanding that health care be provided for all at a price that all can afford. But at least they read the definition of what a government does, and they try to do it: govern. 

Republicans have proven again and again that what they are interested in is the Flood. Like the Engineers in the movie Prometheus (spoiler alert!) they want to create a vicious monster to wipe out humanity – by humanity, I mean anything that is anti-business. Anything that stands in the way of holy profit. And rather than making hideous aliens with elongated heads and acid for blood, Republican elites use the weapon of propaganda against gays, women, minorities, unions, and Planned Parenthood to keep the rank and file busy with inconsequential projects and protests so that they can keep on sucking the blood out of our great nation. Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone Magazine called Goldman Sachs “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.” He was correct but sadly his metaphor was too narrow. The entire Republican power elite is a school of vampire squid that gets together in the depths of the ocean, plans their attacks in secret under cover of night, and then enlists the dumber species of fish to slowly destroy their own environment and themselves. And then the Republican squid jam their blood funnels into the dying corpses. 

What do Republicans continually harp on? The debt. The US Treasury states that, as of August 2012, debt held by the public was approximately $11.19 trillion or about 72% of GDP. Intra-governmental debt was $4.79 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $15.98 trillion. And a global, super-wealthy elite has exploited gaps in tax rules to hide an extraordinary $21 trillion of wealth offshore… according to research commissioned by the Tax Justice Network. Not all members of the global super-wealthy are Americans, but a large proportion are. In fact, according to Thom Hartman, “400 super-rich Americans control more wealth in the country than 150 million other Americans, and yet are effectively taxed at a rate of just over 16% while the rest of us pay up to 35% plus higher levels of sales, property, and other taxes. To put that in perspective these 400 rich oligarchs effective tax rate has dropped by more than 2/3 since Dwight Eisenhower's administration – while the rate for working people has nearly doubled. Rich people get a 2/3 tax cut over the last 50 years – working people get screwed with a 100% tax hike.” And this trend, this horrifying reality is what Republicans want to keep secret. It is why they want to keep the faithful busy with restricting abortion, preventing gays from marrying, and talking about family values and freedom and gun rights. Because if the Republican power elite were forcibly submitted to lie detector tests, I doubt that any answer about their core values would read truthful unless the question was, “Do you believe in money and power?” 

It is our responsibility to educate those whose opinions differ from ours. Many liberals often ghettoize themselves in The Huffington Post and many conservatives ghettoize themselves in Fox News. I see a lot of liberal friends post things on Facebook to their own liberal friends. This is the choir to which they are preaching. I hope we can all reach out to those who claim a different political bent than us and those who claim not to care about politics at all. And I understand being frustrated with the leaders provided to us. The solution is to be the change you wish to see in others. Please vote. And encourage everyone you know to vote. Push them. Cajole them. Drive them to the polling station. Lend them a stamp. Just vote. Because I have to believe there are more thinking people in this nation than there are ignorant ones.

* Mandates policies to protect citizens from themselves.
* Aggressive and sensetive views on social equality.
* Compatible but not necessarily affiliated with Marxism.

* Let citizens make their own decisions. But institutions don't get to jeopardize the safety of the individual.
* Egalitarian, but passive views on social equality.

I say ""probably don't"" because I've seen eyewitness testimony that at least on the surface is compelling, and it's hard to prove a negative. Also, scientists are continually discovering new species. Still, scores of cryptozoologists have ""hunted"" these animals for years and have yet to turn up any hard evidence of their existence.

But isn't it kind of fun to believe in them? The same way it's fun to believe in ghosts, UFO's, and physic phenomena--or at least entertain the possibility. It just makes the world a more interesting place. And in the same neighborhood, maybe just door or two down, is the belief in conspiracy theories.

It's fun to picture a world full of shadow organizations; nefarious groups of puppet-masters in our government and elsewhere meeting in secret chambers, discussing ways to enslave us while performing bizarre rituals. It's good entertainment. It's even more intriguing because those who believe get to be a part of it. They have a role, if only as the person in the know--one who has had their eyes opened and is privy to that which most citizens aren't, and therefore able to help save humanity and fight against it.

But therein lies the danger; it's really easy to get sucked into this sort of thing and start taking it all way too seriously, especially if one has paranoid tendencies. In my occupation, I work with a lot of mentally ill people, and their delusions often have to do with the CIA, the FBI, the Free-Masons, the Illuminati. And where did they get these ideas?

Now, before I go on, let me say; I don't trust the government unquestioningly. We have been lied to before. The government is made up of people, and people lie. And conspiracies have happened. The Gulf of Tonkin really happened. Watergate happened. The recent bridge incident in New Jersey happened, and that was a conspiracy. Not a huge or elaborate one, but a conspiracy nonetheless.  

But conspiracy theorists take a huge leap beyond what we know and what is reasonable and see a conspiracy and a hidden agenda behind everything. Any time there is a mass shooting it's a false flag operation by our government to them. They refuse to even entertain the possibility that maybe a disturbed non-government citizen decided to commit an atrocity for whatever insane reason. No, that's too simple. It was the government.  It's foolish to assume that everyone or even the vast majority of elected officials are malevolent by nature.  That sort of thinking is what leads to actually totalitarian, evil regimes.

Too bad this evil government is always so sloppy, because they seem to leave clues obvious to ""those who really know what's going on"" scattered all over the place whenever they pull one of their deeds. They really need to learn to cover their tracks better.

That exhaust leaving airplanes? Not just a byproduct of the fuel planes consume. No, those are contrails, spraying us all with secret chemicals designed to do some sort of damage to our minds. Vaccinations? An honest attempt by doctors to eradicate and protect children from disease? Please, don't be such a sheeple. More ways to pump our bodies full of mind-altering substances that will make us easier to enslave, so don't vaccinate your kids. Oh, and that smallpox, measles, mumps, etc. are coming back as a result is a small price to pay.

Where conspiracy theorists hook people is by starting with a small bit of truth, then taking it in a wild direction. But that direction is usually an easy to follow narrative that makes sense. It's actually not at all hard to make something sound believable. I once saw a mock documentary on Mermaids, of all things, but it was so well done in a believable, pseudo-scientific way, that I actually started to get sucked into it before I figured out that I was watching fiction. Others had the same reaction, even calling the Navy, outraged at their atrocities towards these cousins of ours.

There are several radio/Internet gurus that espouse these theories that people follow. They convince people that they can't trust the government, but they can trust THEM, because they've figured it all out and have their best interests at heart. And if you'll send them $19.95, they'll send you their DVD explaining everything to you. You HAVE to watch this; you and your families future depends on it. Otherwise, just be a sheeple, but then don't complain when you end up getting shuffled off a FEMA camp at the end of a rifle by a jacked booted, federal thug.

Conspiracy theories aren't exclusive to one particular political philosophy. However, they seem to be most prevalent on the extreme right, especially among libertarians and Tea Party types, and they've even seeped somewhat into the mainstream right. After all, several popular conspiracy theories concern a certain president named Obama who they really don't tend to care much for. He's really a Kenyan, he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. His wife is actually a man.
And here is where the danger starts becoming real. These sort of conspiracy theories are strongly tied with an extreme anti-government view. People who believe that revolution is upon us and that it may be time for an armed insurrection against the Feds. When Cliven Bundy refused to pay grazing fees for letting his cattle use federal land because he ""doesn't recognize the federal government as existing,"" an armed, self-appointed militia came to his defense. These men were ready to shoot federal officers just trying to do their jobs, because they are ""tyrants,"" you see.

As of this writing, these men are still there. They are comical because they take themselves so seriously, but this is also what makes them dangerous. They have set up checkpoints and have stopped and harassed citizens, making them prove that they are residents of the area. They are so invested in their fantasies about themselves and the federal government that they are making it other peoples' problems and trampling on their rights, apparently missing the irony of it all. If they were to actually get their way and overthrow the government, we are getting a nice sneak preview of the new tyranny we will be subjected to, and it'll be ten times worse than what we already have.  What do you think will become of anyone who they deem to not be a ""freedom loving patriot?""  

There are real problems and legitimate concerns that this country is facing. Worrying about men in the woods worshiping an owl statue is just a distraction. An entertaining distraction, but a distraction nonetheless.",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine
98,Ebola is on track to become a global public health disaster and we need to radically increase our efforts to rollback the virus' spread.,0.0,2kc5by,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2kc5by/ebola_is_on_track_to_become_a_global_public/,12.0,1414289004.0,"*I am not a medical professional and I welcome any people with serious medical knowledge to comment and correct any of the following*

In the big picture, there is one fundamental question that should be on our minds when thinking about any disease outbreak: are the total number of cases increasing, or decreasing? 

Currently, cases of ebola in Africa are increasing and, despite our best efforts, don't show any sign of slowing. The media has generally focused most of it's attention on the very few cases that have thus far made it to the U.S., but the sensationalist coverage of the cases in Dallas and now NY seem to be very disconnected from the larger and more important narrative of the catastrophe unfolding in Africa. I think that parts of the Ebola media story have been sensationalized, but overall I think we could very well be dealing with the beginnings of a global medical epidemic that is going to require a commitment of resources and accompanying political response on orders of magnitude greater than we are currently prepared for.

**We need to talk about a medical Marshal Plan for ebola in West Africa.** Even though we have responded by sending in the military and ramping up CDC efforts, I don't see how we are going to avoid a series of increasingly serious incidents in the U.S. without making this our top priority.

The case of Dr. Craig Spencer in NY should make clear why a travel band is neither a short or long-term solution. As a medical worker, he would have been traveling to and from west Africa under a travel ban anyways - unless people are proposing that a travel ban include marooning all U.S. citizens and medical volunteers in Africa, and I don't think they are. I have yet to read a single opinion from a qualified medical professional advocating a travel ban, since it will hamper efforts in Africa. So the Fox News hysterics who are obsessing over that issue can all take a seat for now.

But ebola now appears to be a bigger problem than many people think. There are currently 20,000 to 30,000 cases of Ebola in Africa, but the CDC estimates that there could be **1.4 Million in 4 months**. That is exponential growth. The implications of this go far beyond 50% of 1.4 million Africans dying, horrific as that will be on its own. There could be famine, refugees, political instability, and new cases continuing to break out worldwide as things spread. Ebola is becoming endemic. I'm open to discussing what exactly the implications are, but I think we can agree that the consequences will get worse as cases increase, and cases are undoubtedly increasing. 

When will they stop? They won't. Unless there is a massive containment effort, coupled with a vaccine. I'm optimistic about a vaccine, since it seems like it's being fast-tracked, but it's still going to take at least a year before it's rolled out. I'm definitely interested in hearing more perspectives on the effectiveness of that. But regardless, the current effort at containment needs to be significantly ramped up, if only to buy us more time. 

We don't need to be talking about the possibility of us or people we know actually *getting* ebola, we need to be talking about what happens when there are 10+ cases a week in the U.S. cropping up requiring these now-familiar emergency quarantine procedures. Any healthcare system has a breaking point, and a continual, increasing influx of new ebola cases will be enormously disruptive to daily life, the economy, and our general sanity. I don't see how the current outbreak in Africa is *not* on track to deliver that scary future to us in the next 1-2 years. But if I'm missing something here, by all means please point it out and assuage my concerns. 

To summarize, we need to massive international effort to increase the the amount of money and personnel working to contain ebola in Africa, or else we will continue to see more and more cases cropping up in western countries, with no ceiling to their number. This is a political issue not in the partisan sense, but in the sense that we need to motivate our governments to do this now.",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

Well, as much as I disagree with Ted Cruz, I would lie if I say he wasn't at very eloquent when he talks or that he couldn't write really well (no seriously, he writes pretty well, it's like looking at something you hate a lot but appreciate the artisan construction behind, like reading garbage presented in a Gucci cover). He is very literate. I don't think Ted Cruz wakes up in the morning and feels threatened that gay people are ruining the sanctity of his marriage. I know, I know, there are crazy smart people, but he seems the type behind closed doors and 7 drinks in, that he doesn't really care about gay influence and recognizes minority struggles that can be alleviated besides ""creating jobs by cutting taxes"". 

&nbsp;


Ben Carson, I don't really like him, either. Politics aside, brilliant surgeon. You could see him internally agitated when asked about vaccines. When he responded, he gave an ambiguous answer, he sounded like he was heavily trying to tip toe around a balance between, ""WTH, stop believing this crap about vaccines and autism?"" and ""Carson, don't screw this up. You need to stay in this race, some people in the crowd don't have their chickenpox shots"". When Trump said, ""Give a small dose of vaccines and spread it out over a long period of time. I think if you did that, you'd see a huge drop in autism"", you could totally see Carson looking like, ""WTF, this isn't alcohol man. It's not like if you spread out your shots, you get less drunk"". 

&nbsp;

Even to some degree, Trump is really hard at covering it up with the cheesy American flag hugging and his . Like he has a lot of aversion to slandering homosexuals, probably doesn't care about abortions, and realizes quantitatively that food stamps are an insignificant financial detriment to the US. The dude is a New York billionaire socialite. His Muslim comments probably enticed a call from his billionaire BFFs in Qatar (he admits he's chilled over there with billionaires) to which I guarantee you he said, ""Dude, this is just an act, I'm 69 and bored"".

Jindal has a horrible twang, went to Brown and Oxford. I guarantee you his social awkwardness is a combination of lost identity in the US and strict parents who pushed him to get into Ivy league schools. I'm pretty sure his parents gave him a phone call over his, ""We went to America to become Americans, not Indian-Americans"" comment. 

I am pretty serious in this post, actually. I know I'm making some assumptions, but I truly believe a lot of 2016 candidates are pandering. Some, like Huckabee and Rand Paul, I believe are true conservatives. Others, it seems like a show.  ",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine
101,White House Proposes Cuts to Vaccine Program,0.0,2uutgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2uutgk/white_house_proposes_cuts_to_vaccine_program/,2.0,1423127113.0,"Why is nobody in this hysterical vaccine debate recognizing these key facts:

1. The White House has proposed $50 million in cuts to the vaccine program
2. Obama's position is virtually identical with Chris Christie and Rand Paul - that vaccines should be voluntary, not federally mandated.
3. There are virtually zero politicians right now willing to propose federal mandates for vaccines. 
4. While the party leader, Hillary, has stated ""vaccines work,"" even she has not advocated forced vaccinations.

This ""debate"" is hysterical, but it's not really a debate because there are no politicians who are actually putting any policy forward. It's more circle jerk than debate.

102,Do you think that the US will lose its status as global superpower?,0.0,y2pm05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/y2pm05/do_you_think_that_the_us_will_lose_its_status_as/,65.0,1665636391.0,"By now, it's no secret that there is a possibility that China will become the new superpower. China has been in an economic boom for the past few decades. The country has acutlaly played a big role over the past few centuries, being the source of the silk road. Until the age of colonialism, it had the largest GDP in the world. In fact the Chinese name for China is *zhongguo* meaning ""center state"". All of this plays into the idea that China's rightful place is at the top of global affairs and that the century of humiliation was just a fluke.

Just to be clear, when I say global superpower, I mean the following:

* Largest GDP in the world
* Dominant currency
* Dominates the world through soft and/or hard power
   * Best military
   * Cultural exporter
   * Good at forming diplomatic ties with other countries
* Leads the world in innovation

The US has led the world in these categories since the end of WWII but how mcuh longer can it continue to do so?

Both the US and China have advantages and issues. How well both countries do at solving these issues will determine whether China overtakes the US.

**US**

*Advantages*

* Ths US is relatively open when it comes to immigration. Research shows that immigration has a postiive impact on the host country because immigrants tend to be more entreprenurial and because they bring new perspectives (wisdom of crowds).
* As a high income country, the US currently has an advantage when it comes to pulling in capital and innovating.

*Disadvantages*

* America has issues with political polarization. As we've seen with the Covid vaccine, we can't even agree on basic facts. The US struggles to repair century old infrastructure, unlike China which is currently in the process of building it.
   * Race relations are also an issue
* Making education equally accessible should be a priority for the US. This will not only help alleviate inequality but also increase America's high skill workforce, increasing productivity.

**China**

*Advantages*

* Admitedly, getting things done is much easier when the government allows for unilalteralism. Compromise is actually pretty inefficient. For example, pretty mcuh all of China's high speed rail network was constructed after the California high speed rail was first announced, the latter has faced significant setbacks. This doesn't mean that demcoracy is inefficient (since European coutnries have simialrly high quality public transit) but rather that the US isn't in a very good place for cooperating.
* China has a population four times larger than the US. This means that China's GDP per capita only needs to be a quarter of America's before it's on even footing. Even if China only manages to achieve the same per capita GDP as the US, that's four times America's GDP. Obviously, it seems that the rest of the world would catch up enough to keep this from happening but if that were to be the case now, China would hold a majority of global GDP.

*Disadvantages*

* The only good thing to invest in is real estate. Government bonds don't offer enogu return and the stock market is too risky. This has helped to encourage land speculation. Considering the current state of the economy, it may already be too late to address this one.
* As a middle income country, China is approaching what is known as the middle income trap. You see, the reason why lower income countries are able to sell products to higher income coutnries is because they're cheap. However, as people get richer, wages go up. Eventually, it reaches a point where it stops being cost effective.
* China is heading for a demographic bust. Unlike the US which can simply rely on immigration, China has a strong ethnic tradition, pretty much leaving that out of the question. This means that if China doesn't at least get fertility rates up to 2 per woman, the working age population will be burdened by the elderly.

Whichever country does a better job at addressing their structural issues will be dominant. If China addresses its issues better than the US, China will come out on top. If the US addresses its issues while China fails to addresses theirs, the US will remain global superpower.",PoliticalDiscussion,Vaccine

104,Accepting that there are advantages & disadvantages to gun ownership,0.0,3g4m23,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3g4m23/accepting_that_there_are_advantages_disadvantages/,70.0,1438954284.0,"So, I'm absolutely furious by gun proponents' irrational unwillingness to entertain the notion that gun ownership may have drawbacks. I propose the following compromise and reality check for each side of the aisle.

Gun opponents: guns *are* used to successfully prevent crime and in self-defense. It's debatable exactly how often this happens and we have no way of knowing what the outcome *would* have been if the victim had been unarmed, but a gun is a good way, for example, to scare away an unarmed or less-heavily-armed intruder. 

http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/defensive-gun-use/

Gun proponents: you have to admit that the presence of a gun probably increases the likelihood of suicide, accidental death, and homicide. It's just plain logical that, if I have a bout of severe depression, or become uncontrollably angry, then I am more likely to harm someone if I have a good tool at hand for doing so!... & guns are among the most excellent tools for suicide and homicide. 

This argument is absolutely flawless. It is not necessarily an anti-gun position, just a fact which shows that gun ownership has some disadvantages. The pro-gun guys need to accept it, and if they don't, they are being just as irrational as climate-change deniers or the anti-vaccine crowd.

The most lucid optimistic argument comes from Igor Schatz in [this long twitter threat](https://twitter.com/copernicus2013/status/1495936129358520321?s=21). I have compiled it to readable form here. I am curious if anyone here sees major flaws with his reasoning. His basic is that Putin’s bluff has been called and Putin is now chained to an outcome he did not want. Schatz’s comments in essay form below:

My 2 cents on Putin’s decision today:

This is a strategic defeat for Putin and a full-scale war is even less likely after today then before. Let me explain in this thread. The primary goal of Putin has been to subjugate Ukraine and especially its foreign and defense policy to Russian interests and priorities.

In essence the goal was to make Ukraine into a vassal state, a la Belarus where Russia retains full political control and leverage and which is currently in the process of soft annexation. The primary tool to achieve this goal have been Minsk protocol 2 which were signed in 2015 after a Russian-military-led offensive on Debaltseve, a small town in Donbas but a major railway juncture. 

This agreement achieved a cease fire, a pow exchange and basically stopped the active phase of the conflicts. The protocol aimed at reintegrating the separatist part of Donbas into Ukraine proper but on the conditions drafted by separatists’ Russian handlers. More specifically, Putin’s focus on Minsk 2 was on the part that would require Ukraine to conduct a constitutional reform that would give the separatist region a special status that would allow it to veto any foreign and defense policy decisions. 

Since separatists are just Russian puppets and their leaders are in fact Russian citizens ( the current one is even a member of Putin’s party ), this would essentially give Russian government a direct political control over Ukraine, essentially eliminating its sovereignty for all intents and purposes. Additionally, the protocol envisioned full amnesty to separatists many of which engaged in outright criminal activity and human rights abuses that would be on par with Hamas. It also stipulated that the separatist militants would be renamed and remade into a local police with potential jurisdiction over the whole country, and it also put the region in charge of appointing its own judges and prosecutors, that of course would be drawn from the ranks of militants with the implicit advice and consent form Kremlin. You can imagine the kind of Justice that would be practiced by such judges and courts.. there was 0 chance that Ukraine was going to accede to giving up its sovereignty, as it has had 0 political and civic support for obvious reasons.

The confidence game put on by Putin that involved the massive show of force aimed at compelling Ukraine or compelling the west to force Ukraine to abandon its sovereignty via this backdoor maneuver. Putin’s calculus was that the west is divided and weak, Biden Administration is weak especially since he canceled sanctions on NS2 in may and practically agreed at the Geneva summit in June to do Putin’s bidding on talking Ukraine into Minsk 2. 

Putin also counted on destabilizing Ukraine politically by keeping the threats of force, potentially leading to the fall of government and divided country that would lead to a friendlier regime that he could either control or even potentially install. All of these assumptions of Putin were proven wrong… the west is united, and even Putin’s attempt to send separate letters with same demands/proposals to different countries in a gambit to try and pick some off didn’t work.

Instead he got one response from the EU directly basically telling him “buddy, why you wasting your time and printer paper sending your silly letters around when you can just send one directly to Brussels which is where you gonna get a single response from”. His progressive escalation also didn’t work on rattling Ukrainians.. there was no panic in the country, the political leadership was united and showed amazing resilience and resolve and the army was disciplined not to respond to military provocations. 

Putin kept escalating because inertia took over and because he assumed that credible threats of war (culminating with nuclear drills over the weekend) would scare soft Europeans who don’t want war and who are visiting the Kremlin like never before. At the same time, the US has turned up its own info war which basically meant to say that a) we are not going to honor your ultimatums and b) we have seen your war threats and are ready for war if that’s what you intend. 

The reaction from the Ukrainian government was similar a) your demands to give up our sovereignty are unacceptable; b) we will talk about our aspirations to join NATO louder because its our sovereign right to chose alliances we sign up for and c) we see your troops on our borders and hear your threats but we won’t panic and we are confident in our army that acquired a lot of combat experience since 2014 ( I’ve seen a number of 400,000 of Ukrainians with active combat experience ) and is highly motivated. Meanwhile, the UK, Canada, the US and a number of other NATO countries have been sending plane loads of weapons to Ukraine for weeks, on some days up to a dozen planes - to either help deter Putin or help Ukraine army defend the country more effectively. 

In the end, Putin’s confidence game has failed, since he never planned on the actual war which would be costly in resources and lives and very risky since given Ukraine’s resolve he wouldn’t achieve political aims even by military means, he doesn’t have enough troops to control the country which is the 2nd largest in Europe by territory and has a large population motivated to kill an invading force, and this adventure might even cost him his own regime at home.

The decision to recognize the separatist part of Donbas today is probably the worst outcome for him and the best for Ukraine: it buries Minsk protocols, getting Ukraine off the hook politically and preserves the status quo by freezing the conflict but in a favorable state: full responsibility for the area is shifted to Russia, Russian troops that are already present there would now merely operate actually wearing their uniforms and as such holding Russia more accountable for what happens there while accelerating military and economic aid for Ukraine as well as needed domestic reforms that would speed up the eventual path to the EU.  For Putin, this is a strategic defeat because he lost Minsk protocol as a tool for potential political leverage over Ukraine.

Ukraine is now more united, more anti-Russia and on a faster path of spinning out of Kremlin’s “sphere of influence”. Why did Putin go for this option ? Well, faced with western and Ukraine’s resolve in response to his ultimatums and what he thought were credible threats of force, but unwilling to make good on these threats (high five to the boys at Langley for confronting his bluff in the information space) he also needed to save face and show a win for all his Herculean confidence efforts. The win that he needed for this not so much to show to his domestic audience but to show to his own little circle of strongman that constitute his inner circle… because coming out of this as a loser in their eyes would basically dramatically shorten his reign.

The residual risks right now is that the separatists might want to expand their territorial control since they only control 1/3 of the administrative regions in Donbas and claim domain over the whole admin region. While this is a risk, it doesn’t seem highly likely since it would create a risk of a big war for Putin that he was trying to avoid, since expanding territories controlled by “sovereign republics” doesn’t score anything for Putin politically while risking far harsher sanctions and bad optics of dead civilians that allegedly he wants to protect, etc.. this is probably a good time for him to consolidate and absorb mild sanctions from the west while doing his best to shift attention from this issue for now he is likely to come back with another attempt at Ukraine at another time, but for now he knows he lost badly and its better to get attention away from this quickly to make sure the strongmen around him don’t think too hard and realize the same. 

It’s much better for him to focus on the ongoing soft annexation of Belarus which I predicted a month ago. Russian troops aren’t leaving after the end of planned exercises yesterday, and Belarus is holding a constitutional referendum on the 27th. Part of this constitutional reform calls for allowing Belarus to host nuclear weapons on its territory (guess whose wink-wink), and if you followed Belarus elections in August 2020, you’d know that results of the referendum are preordained. 

So we will likely have permanent Russian military bases and nukes on Belarus territory shortly… look on the map and you’ll see that Belarus is quite close to the center of Europe.. this would be a legitimate win for Putin and I think he’d want to focus the attention of his entourage as well as homegamers watching state tv on a legitimate win and away from Ukraine where he lost.. the small wild card is whether anti-Lukashenko protests that were suppressed in 2020 will will resume if the people realize that their independence and sovereignty at stake in a country where Lukashenko has little support and legitimacy.. mind you, Lukashenko has always been independent-minded on behalf of his country and this is a new development. 

Some final thoughts: why has Putin decided to raise the stakes now.. i think COVID is partially responsible.. during COVID Putin has been isolated and has narrowed his inner circle and the people he sees personally. Just look at him meeting foreign leaders to refuse to submit to the anal-probe Covid test at the opposite end of a 50 foot long table. 

My theory is that he is deadly afraid of COVID partly because he has grown more paranoid, partly because he might be immune compromised based on reports of some severe illness he might have had in 2019 (unconfirmed), and also because he is not vaccinated and he has seen the severe death toll of the unvaxxed in Russia. I am pretty confident that he is not vaccinated because he is too paranoid to allow himself to be injected with anything. 

Because his inner circle likely narrowed to the hard liners, this also means that his sources of information and advice have narrowed and he likely only receives advice and info that he wants to see and/or that his entourage wants him to see. And he probably miscalculated in his assumptions that his confidence van would succeed because they were based on information that wasn’t representative of reality. My theory also explains why his speech today was so unhinged. He came across extremely angry, but mainly because he has lost and he had to resort to the option in his arsenal that he wasn’t really planning on using.

To summarize: Putin played a high confidence game to compel the west to new world order and to compel Ukraine to loss of sovereignty and lost. There won’t be a full-scale war (though limited confrontation in the east Ukraine is still very much on the table). But there also won’t be a big deescalation, though I think we will see some troop drawdown shortly since he can’t keep the troops idle for too long living in tents in the middle of the Russian winter end. 

Basically, if Putin was serious about a full-scale invasion he wouldn’t need the theater of recognizing the separatist “republics” first; he also would have had the state prepare the nation for war through months-long war propaganda - which wasn’t happening … Putin thought he was going around open-carrying in Massachusetts but realized that he is in Texas instead... so he had to resort to grabbing a misplaced wallet and retreating to the nearest bar to get drunk.",geopolitics,Vaccine

Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare.

The Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country.

Part of gaining legitimacy to govern is stamping out petty corruption in the bureaucracy. To government regularly takes action such as firing hundreds of [police officers](https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/rwanda-fires-200-police-officers-accused-of-corruption-20170206), or entire departments of the [ministry of health](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Rwanda-fires-health-directors-disbands-medical-tech-unit/4552908-4707022-voekylz/index.html) suspected of corruption and as a result Transparency International's Corruption Index ranks Rwanda the least corrupt Least Developed Country in the world. Moreover, the government has worked assiduously with donors to adapt best practices on institutional design to local circumstances. An example of this is the Imihigo system of to a management. Imihigo refers to a precolonial system where warriors would publicly pledge what they would accomplish in battle, and face humiliation if they failed to achieve those goals. In its modern adaptation, mayors and other higher level officials would pledge to accomplish development goals, and assisted by a large core of elected local leaders in achieving those goals. While the goals were set by the central government, elected leaders have high levels of authority in how goals are to implemented allowing for best practices to spread from district to district.

One of the greatest successes of the efficient and flexible state is improving public health outcomes in Rwanda. Rwanda today has a life expectancy of 67 and an infant mortality rate of 29, levels of health outcomes similar to much wealthier nations such as India or Bolivia. Part of this success stems from the over 45,000 elected community health workers at the village level. They are generally respected members of the community and tasked with ensuring universal vaccination, and to serve as the first line of healthcare. In order to improve health in a systematic manner, the government has implemented a health insurance system that covers over 90% of the population. The bottom quarter of the population does not have to pay into the system, and even the top .5% of Rwandans only have to pay $9 a month. However, given most Rwandans hover above basic subsistence, it has taken the coercive might of the Rwandan state to make this system financially feasible.

Unsurprisingly, the government and international NGOs have struggled to operate in such a difficult environment. In today’s podcast episode, I will discuss the origins of political violence in North Kivu and Ituri, the administrative chaos that has resulted from 25 years of civil war, and how this has made effective action against Ebola next to impossible.

The Belgian colonial administration had long [promoted ](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.2250&rep=rep1&type=pdf)the pastoralist Hema over the agricultural Lendu as part of its divide and conquer strategy of ruling. The Hema maintained their privileged status after independence. The Congo Wars saw a massive influx of arms to the region, and unsurprisingly Lendu organized militias to use force to gain power and privileges for themselves. The conflict [restarted ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/uganda-strains-thousands-flee-violence-dr-congo-ituri-190626061523083.html)in June of 2019, with at least 160 killed in Hema Lendu clashes, and hundreds of thousands fleeing to Uganda.

Unsurprisingly, Congo has seen a complete breakdown of state authority in the Congo since the beginning of the wars. The state lost much of its ability to [tax](http://www.lse.ac.uk/international-development/Assets/Documents/PDFs/csrc-working-papers-phase-two/wp21.2-rise-and-decline-of-the-congolese-state.pdf), and with it the ability to finance the provision of basic services. Hospitals are so [strapped ](https://www.apnews.com/daf47512c8f74e869b722782299b4a0e)for cash that they must hold patients hostage to get money to buy basic supplies. Doctors and Nurses regularly go unpaid for [months](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-health-crisis-looms-doctors-strike-continues), and the state relies upon the [Catholic church](https://www.voanews.com/africa/catholic-church-drc-defends-role-paying-teachers) to pay public servants in remote areas because the government lacks the capacity to do so. Progress often occurs more on paper than in practice. For example, according to [official statistics](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.imm.meas), 80% of infants in the Congo have been immunized for measles. Despite this, a massive measles outbreak has [infected ](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/drc-declares-measles-outbreak-after-1500-deaths)87,000 and killed over 1,500. Basic healthcare services are a [patchwork ](https://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1505-8-20)of private clinics and non-profits that are not up to the task of containing a major epidemic. The public neither pays taxes, nor receives benefits from the state, and so sees it as an outside force unconcerned with the best interests of the public. This especially true in the northeast of the Congo, where the outbreak is concentrated. In the runup to the 2018 presidential election, the government of the Congo [cancelled ](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-elections-reversing-dangerous-decision)voting in Beni and Butembo, two cities hit hard by the Ebola crisis because of the public health crisis. The president has on multiple occasion expressed strong [dislike ](https://www.jww.org/conflict-areas/drc/killings-beni-whos-behind-atrocities/)for the largest ethnic group of the city, and the city was almost certain to vote for the opposition. The public’s view of ebola became wrapped up with the political conflict. One [quarter ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30063-5/fulltext)of people in the region do not believe there is an ebola crisis, while another third believe it is perpetrated by nefarious force. The lack of administrative capacity, and trust in government has made ebola all but impossible to combat.

Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is terrifying for the horrific way it kills people, and its lethal nature. People with ebola [suffer ](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease)from vomiting, nausea, decreased liver and kidney function, and eventually massive internal and external bleeding. The disease is incredibly [lethal](https://mailchi.mp/sante.gouv.cd/ebola_kivu_04juil19), with 57% of all people suffering from ebola dying in the current outbreak. Although ebola is a terrifying disease, it isn’t necessarily a difficult disease to control. Ebola is most contagious at the later stages of the disease, or in the [corpse ](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6508a2.htm)of someone has contracted ebola. Funerals have emerged as a powerful vector for spreading the disease, and a flashpoint in relations between local communities. Public health workers faced hostility from villagers angry that their relatives were being taken away to treatment facilities and could not even be buried in a traditional manner if they died. Attacks my community members against public health workers are common, and 85 health care workers and 42 clinics have been [attacked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). Worryingly, some of the attacks may have escalated from disorganized mobs, to [coordinated ](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/06/04/726139304/an-urgent-mystery-whos-attacking-ebola-responders-in-congo-and-why)militia attacks and disinformation campaigns. The details of what is behind this are murky at best, but only make sense in the context of state failure that I have so far described. The regions conflict have also resulted in large numbers of refugees [fleeing](https://www.africanews.com/2019/07/03/congolese-refugees-fleeing-to-uganda-nearly-double-to-8000-in-past-month//) to other countries in the region, spreading the virus to new places. A child fleeing to Uganda infected members of his family [resulting ](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/health/ebola-uganda-africa-congo-intl/index.html)in 3 deaths. However, Uganda and other countries in the region have substantially better organized public health system, and seem capable of [containing ](https://www.independent.co.ug/who-chief-meets-museveni-reassured-on-ebola-control/)ebola outbreaks.

The ebola crisis today has deep political roots that have resulted in the collapse of the state’s administrative capacity that has made it impossible to effectively react to the ebola crisis. This desperate situation is made even worse by the fact that the international effort to fight the ebola fighting is running out of funds. The WHO expected health financing from February to July to cost $98 million, but only $44 million has been received funding. The WHO has so far been able to move funds around to keep anti-ebola efforts, but it is a fundamentally unsustainable system.

# INTRODUCTION

About two weeks ago, the Economist had three articles about China's involvement in Southeast Asia, a leader titled [ The rivalry between America and China will hinge on South-East Asia](https://archive.is/oOFsm), an article in Asia section [Asian countries are learning to cope with Chinese bullying](https://archive.is/0Morl) and in Briefing [Tea and tributaries In no region is China’s influence felt more strongly than in South-East Asia](https://archive.is/me4NV).

This post will focus on the last article and will be organized as follows

1. SUMMARY
2. COMMENTARY
   1. *COMING BY SEA: THE MERCHANTS*
   2. *ASSIMLATION AND INTEGRATION*
   3. *THE MANDARINS: CONTROLLING FOLLOW PEOPLE AND GOODS*
   4. *OPENING THE FRONTIER AND COLONIALISM*
   5. *SURGE IN MIGRATION AND DEVELOPING THEIR OWN IDENTITY*
   6. *CHINA'S INFLUENCE IN A ""COMPETITIVE"" REGION*
   7. *NEW MIGRANTS*
   8. *MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA: INSECURITY*
   9. CHINA'S INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS
   10. *CHINA'S POLICIES TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIAN CHINESE: NO MORE DRAMA*
3. CONCLUSION

I decided to do this post for two reasons, to provide people with a basic understanding of China's engagement with the region from pre-colonial times until now. 

# SUMMARY

The article starts by describing the Milk Tea Alliance, a democratic solidarity alliance, that started as a meme, made of netizens from Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Myanmar. It was set up in response to Chinese internet trolls and nationalist commentators on social media. The Alliance was united in their love of Milk Tea and opposition to anti-China Communist party solidarity

**HISTORY AND PAST MIGRATION**

Imperial China claimed primacy over Southeast Asian rulers. Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma (now Myanmar) were important tributaries. Mr. Bilahari Kausikan, a former Singaporean diplomat accuses China of “imperial hauteur”—a conviction that lesser states owe deference to China.

Ethnic Han Chinese (mainly men) from southern China began to seek livelihoods in the European settlements of Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila \[around (the 17-19th century) The bulk of the migration of ethnic Chinese happened in the 19th and 20th century as they flocked to European plantations and mines, or sought fortunes in trading ports.

**Fact Check:** *The article talks about Chinese flocking to British and French rubber plantations. While true for British colonies, most Chinese in French Indochina were traders or craftsmen,* *French plantations usually employed the native population*

Chinese in Southeast Asia influenced events in China, by being key backers of the revolt against the Manchu Qing Dynasty. More recently, South-East Asian nationals of Chinese descent helped kick-start China’s industrial transformation. Today ASEAN is a key link in the supply chains of a China-centered electronics sector. Chinese tycoons are still intermediaries in the region’s economic relationship with China.

**Fact Check:** [Southeast Asian investment in China is small, making up 5% of foreign investment from 1979-2006, dominated by Singapore with 65%](https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jsaa/article/download/445/445-470-1-PB.pdf) (p3)*. The economic connections between Southeast Asia Chinese business and Mainland Chinese business are exaggerated,*

**ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT AND NEW MIGRANTS (XIN YIMIN)**

The PRC's aggressive economic push into Southeast Asia has occurred in the decade for most countries. It consists of government backed/guaranteed infrastructure associated with the BRI and private investors. China is a major source of infrastructure loans needed for 1.7 trillion infrastructure investment for developing Asia over 15 years,

Along with this economic engagement has resulted in new migration from China (Xin Yimin or New Migrants). These migrants come in many forms.

* Workers associated with PRC sponsored BRI projects
* Private entrepreneurs and workers for private Chinese companies. They range from tech entrepreneurs in Singapore and illegal migrants working in the “Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone” (Ie border area of Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos) in Chinese-owned online casinos in the Philippines.

**FIGHT OVER WATER: MEKONG AND SOUTH CHINA SEA**

The dispute between China and her neighbors in Southeast Asia is over water. In Mainland Southeast Asia it is over the flow of the Mekong. A drought in 2019 in the lower Mekong might have been exacerbated by Chinese dam-building.

In Maritime Southeast Asia, its over China's sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea.

**CHINESE INFLUENCING OPERATIONS AND OVERSEAS CHINESE**

China's influence operations toward Southeast Asian Chinese by the United Front Department. A key mission is to ensure that, as Bill Hayton puts it in “The Invention of China”: “regardless of how long ago someone’s ancestors left home, or for how many generations they have been citizens of another country, they…still have obligations to the ancestral nation.”

Using the example of the Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia and Indonesian Chinese Governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok), the article says it creates a situation where ethnic Chinese are seen, right or wrongly, as a fifth column. China argues the Economist is often insensitive to this dynamic.

**Opinion:** In the first case the Ambassador intervened, intervened against government-affiliated groups harassing ethnic Chinese merchants. Was it his initiative? In the second case, with Ahok, the Chinese government didn't say anything, even though anti-Chinese violence did occur, because the major thrust of the attack on Ahok was political and religious.

**VACCINES**

The article concludes by talking about China's vaccine diplomacy, with China hoping it would endear itself with Southeast Asians. However, if the vaccines fail to work, it would backfire on China, and Southeast Asia's ethnic Chinese would be tarred.

*Opinion: Given most SEA countries will buy vaccines from China, instead of getting the vaccine for free,* [*I don't see how this is will be a diplomatic win or disaster. It is largely a business transaction*](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/12/07/indonesia-spends-45-million-to-procure-millions-of-vaccine-doses-from-china-this-year.html)*.*

# COMMENTARY

The article looks at China's influence in the region, without looking at it historically and comparatively. China's influence in the region was limited, despite China's size and proximity:

1. The primary way in which China interacted with the region was through trade. However, assimilation and indigenization means over time they develop a separate identity,
2. China's official engagement was checkered and with the centuries-long period of disengagement. China influenced Southeast Asia largely by controlling the flow of people in and out of its ports.
3. Chinese influence is one of many. Southeast Asia is heterogeneous, where multiple influences intermingle.
4. Currently, China faces competition in the region and its economic and demographic impact isn't nearly as strong as perceived.

Furthermore, China's potential in the region is hampered bY mistrust toward China and each other, China's past failure and traumas during the Cold War have made it adopt a conservative and cautious approach in many countries.

# COMING BY SEA: THE MERCHANTS

Outside small communities of Han Chinese in Northern Vietnam and upload areas of Myanmar and Thailand, the vast majority of Chinese arrived in Southeast Asia by sea starting from 200 BC, most of them came from Guangdong and Fujian.

It was also sparsely populated, In 1800 its population was estimated at 12-15 Million, in contrast, China's [population was 350 Million in 1800](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Economic-History/Assets/Documents/WorkingPapers/Economic-History/2015/WP219.pdf)[.](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/#:~:text=China%202020%20population%20is%20estimated,of%20the%20total%20world%20population)

Before the Song Dynasty, Chinese merchants and travelers mostly used [foreign ocean-going vessels to travel to Southeast Asia and beyond](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212682112000261). The first Chinese settlements in the region start appearing around the 11-12th century.

Before the 19th century, national or racial identities were vague, being Chinese was determined by cultural practices like worshipping Chinese deities. Chinese sojourners would marry local women or buy their ""wives"" at the slave markets. Most would be integrated within the local community

However, some Chinese formed distinct assimilated communities with local women and formed what is called Peranakan in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Peranakan spoke a local language with some Chinese vocabulary thrown in (Hokkien) and wore both native and Chinese clothing In the 19th century the definition was extended to full bloodied Chinese who adopted native customs and language.

# SURGE IN MIGRATION AND DEVELOPING THEIR OWN IDENTITY

Starting from 1830-40s, the largest wave of Chinese immigration to Southeast Asia, began. Unlike before, most of the migrants were laborers and craftsmen and had the numbers to form their own communities where they speak could their own dialects

As for education, Southeast Asian Chinese went to Chinese Language. Native Language or European Language Schools. Before the 1890s, Chinese schools were all dialect schools; but from the 1890s onward was gradually replaced by Mandarin medium schools Outside of Malaysia and Singapore, Mandarin never became the dominant language spoken by Southeast Asian Chinese, due to subsequent bans or severe restrictions on Chinese medium education in [Indonesia (1967-2000),](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/53548/INDO_14_0_1107127730_49_71.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) [Thailand (1950-90s)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/651712?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Acc74c59f9e333a2b97b727e166c27df8&seq=22#page_scan_tab_contents) and Vietnam (1975-1990). In the[ Philippines and Myanmar, despite relative freedom, only about 10-15% were enrolled in Chinese medium schools.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/651712?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Acc74c59f9e333a2b97b727e166c27df8&seq=22#page_scan_tab_contents)

Even in Malaysia and Singapore, ethnic Chinese have indigenized and developed their own identity distinct from Mainland China. [In Singapore, English is the dominant language spoken by Singaporean Chinese households](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2331186X.2016.1161958). In Malaysia, the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians attend Chinese medium primary schools (SJK-Cina), but most continue their secondary education in English/Malay.

# THE MANDARINS: CONTROLLING FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS

R[elations with Southeast Asian polity until Yuan Dynasty (Mongols) was generally voluntary rather than imposed](https://www.google.com/books/edition/China_and_Southeast_Asia/lcTADwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) (p132). Outside Vietnam, pre-colonial Asia's official contacts between countries were limited to infrequent contacts every 1-3 years at its height, there would be long stretches lasting 100-200 years where there would be no official contact.

China's official engagement in the region since 1949 is checkered, and only in 1991, she had diplomatic relations with all countries in Southeast Asia. No country in Southeast Asia has maintained full diplomatic relations with China from the 1950s to now.

**IMPERIAL CHINESE TRADE POLICY**

Before the Song Dynasty, China had an open trade regime, meaning foreign traders could come and go into Chinese ports, and the state collected taxes from the trade.

In the Song and Ming Dynasties, both dynasties tied trade to tribute status, but eventually abandoned it as ability/interest in controlling trade weakened. [Under the Song, until 1141 China restricted access to foreign ships of tributary nations, but afterward allowed ships from non-tributarie](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Maritime_Sector_Institutions_and_Sea_Pow/ddcV_cGegX4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=tang+dynasty+trade+policy&pg=PA118&printsec=frontcover)s. Initially, the Ming tried to channel all trade to official tribute missions, but over time this trade was replaced by smuggling, the relaxation of [Chinese ships traveling overseas, and local authorities just taxing non-tribute foreign ships instead of banning them](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-4053-5_7).

Under the Yuan Dynasty, trade was controlled by Muslim merchants who formed partnerships with officials, but [trade declined from 1290-1350s, as the Yuan tried to achieve political dominance and monopoly on trade through force (p83)](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Offshore_Asia/lcT3AwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=song+dynasty+trade+policies&pg=PA77&printsec=frontcover)

To many, the Qing are painted as reactionary toward trade, it instituted the Canton system in 1757, most likely to curb the influence of Christian missionaries. However, the Canton system arose out of a liberal trade regime. In 1684, Emperor Kangxi officially [ended the tribute trade, and allowed merchants from both tribute and non-tribute to enter at least 50 coastal ports](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Qing_Opening_to_the_Ocean/r1gEEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=qing+dynasty+trade+and+tribute&printsec=frontcover), and lifted the ban on Chinese merchants traveling overseas. By 1700, there were tens of thousands of Chinese merchants in ports throughout Southeast Asia. [However, between 1717-27, the Qing government placed a ban on Chinese traveling to Luzon (Philippines) and Batavia (Jakarta)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv3wdbw4.18?seq=13#metadata_info_tab_contents), as well as stopping Chinese merchants returning from returning to China from these locations.

It was during the period of open trade with Southeast Asia, that migrants to the region developed a reputation as trouble makers and lawbreakers that persist to this day, [despite their contribution to the imperial coffers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv3wdbw4.18?seq=29#metadata_info_tab_contents) (p443). Most likely because the main source provinces of Guangdong and Fujian also have sub-culture of criminality due to a history of smuggling due to periodic trade restrictions and the presence of secret societies.

**BELT AND ROAD AND PRIVATE CHINESE COMPANIES**

In the early Ming and with the BRI, private Chinese companies/traders would often join official delegations In the 15th century, 50% of the envoys from Java had Chinese surnames. During a tribute mission, [the bulk of the trade is collateral trade occurring outside the formal tribute, bought by the envoy and accompany by merchants](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-4053-5_7). The same principle applies today with trade delegations. Chinese leaders go to countries promising billions of aid and investments. These delegations included potential Chinese private/SOE investors who are like the collateral trade during a Ming tribute mission. For example, the Indonesian government was complaining about China not keeping their promises, but realized they had to take initiative, and started aggressively contacting investors on these trade delegations, and Chinese FDI in Indonesia went from [US$0.6 Billion in 2015 (p37)](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/document/662318) to US$ 8.3 Billion in 2020.

China's first infrastructure projects in Africa were modeled on Japan's agreements with China in the 1980s, which exchanged infrastructure for natural resources. However, the difference was Japanese projects were focused on East Asia and Southeast Asia where Japanese companies had a presence, whereas China's construction projects aren't tied to the presence of Chinese private / SOE investors. [From 2011-2017, China loaned an average of US$13 Billion to Africa](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198830504.001.0001/oso-9780198830504-chapter-8), but the Chinese FDI has hovered around [$2-3 Billion a year for the last decade](http://www.sais-cari.org/chinese-investment-in-africa).

Even where Chinese infrastructure funding and private investment have a strong presence like Indonesia, there isn't much synergy. For example, [North Sulawesi](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3009231/chinese-tourists-made-indonesias-manado-big-winner-and), is a popular destination for Chinese tourist, and Chinese investors are planning to build hotel resorts, but the Indonesian government-financed airport upgrades in North Sulawesi airport themselves, With this in mind, Indonesia has slated North Sulawesi as one of four provinces for Chinese BRI project.

My personal opinion is people are caught up with the BRI, they should focus on Chinese infrastructure lending and private FDI. Not all Chinese infrastructure lending is BRI, and some private investments are classified as BRI. Many strategically significant private investments aren't counted, and vice versa. People often confuse a loan pledged against natural resources for infrastructure as an investment in the build a plant with no guarantee of return.

# OPENING THE FRONTIER AND COLONIALISM

Southeast Asia, especially Maritime Southeast Asia, is the most ""colonized"" region in Asia. Philippines, Malacca, and Spice Islands have been colonized by Europeans starting in the 1500s. Until the First Opium War in 1839, Southeast Asia was the main conduit for China's contact with the West. Most Western ships would sail from ports in Southeast Asia, and Chinese merchants would travel to colonial ports in Southeast Asia. The earliest [Dutch-Chinese](https://brill.com/view/journals/qua/35/1-2/article-p109_7.xml) and Spanish-Chinese dictionaries were published in Batavia and Luzon respectively in the mid-1600s.

Modern Southeast Asia economic foundations begin in the 19th century when its jungles were cleared for plantations and mines. This expansion was followed by rapid natural population growth and migration of millions of Chinese and Indians. The bulk of ethnic Chinese are descendants of people who migrated during this wave from 1850-1949. This period saw the birth of new towns, most notable, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Davao (Philippines), and Bandung (Indonesia).

While many were escaping the dire situation in China, they were also equally motivated by opportunities the opening of Southeast Asia created. One can see the wealth they brought back by the large European inspired fortress mansions they built in their home villages

&#x200B;

The presence of ethnic Chinese is intertwined with colonialism. Here is a group photo of Chinese and Dutch women in the Dutch East Indies in the 1930s. The Chinese women are wearing either Javanese, Chinese and Western dress. The women both Dutch and Chinese would have communicated in a mix of Malay, Dutch, and Javanese. While racial classifications existed in the Dutch East Indies, the definition of European was applied to any whose European father recognized them as their legitimate children. Most ""Europeans"" were part native or Chinese.

While, Southeast Asia historically was part of the Indosphere, by the 19th century it starts the process of integrating with East Asia and marks the beginning of the decline in Indian influence. Today there are hundreds of thousands of Muslim Indonesian maids working in Hong Kong and Taiwan with Sanskrit-influenced names like Supriyanti, Darmawati, etc.

# CHINA'S ""INFLUENCE"" IN A COMPETITIVE REGION

Southeast Asia has varied economic ties, which have become more diversified over time. The table below shows China's share of Southeast Asia's exports, FDI, Infrastructure funding, and Tourism. It is much lower than United States dominance in North America or Germany's importance in Europe.

 

|Category|China's Position and Share (includes HK)|Competitor Position and Share|
|:-|:-|:-|
|% of Asean Exports To Region (2019) ^(1)|1 20.7%|2. EU 18% 3. USA  12.9%|

&#x200B;

1 For trade we use ASEAN exports to China because it is a better indicator of dependency. It varies between countries, but every ASEAN country runs a trade deficit with China. Australia and New Zealand exports to China make up [35%](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/AUS/Year/2018/TradeFlow/Export) and [24%](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/AUS/Year/2018/TradeFlow/Export) of their total exports and [South America](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/BRA/Year/2018/TradeFlow/Export) roughly sends about 25% of its total exports to China

2 Since 2015 China's share of FDI is 14-16%. EU is ASEAN's largest investor, with second place alternating between China, US, Japan, and Inter-ASEAN.

Companies from different nationalities invest in different sectors. European investments are mostly in banking and services, the Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese are predominately in manufacturing, ranging from 70-80% of the investment. The Chinese companies are more diversified than other East Asian countries with about 20-25% in manufacturing, and the rest divided among utilities, infrastructure, telecommunication, services, and mining

# NEW MIGRANTS

The number of new Chinese migrants in [Southeast Asia is estimated to be around 2 Million (20](https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/advanced/1093148/new-wave-of-chinese-coming-to-live-in-thailand) out of Southeast Asia's total population of 673 Million, It s most likely more, but even if you take the outlandish estimates for each country the combined total would be less than 4 Million. It might seem like a lot, but as a % of the population, it is small compared to recent Chinese migrants in Australia or Canada. The bulk of them come from Yunnan as they cross overland from the porous borders between China and Mainland Southeast Asia (ie Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia)

The number of legal Chinese immigrating to Southeast Asia is low. The only country where there is a substantial [number of legal permanent Chinese migrants is Singapore, with 450,000](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrants-in-spore-mostly-from-malaysia), where 70,000 are from Hong Kong and Macau. This number includes naturalized Singaporean citizens, Permanent Residents, and Temporary Workers Compared to the West, Singapore [isn't a welcoming place for Mainland migrants, it is often seen as a stepping stone for most Mainland migrants to the West.](https://archive.is/YB9tC) In most other Southeast Asian countries it is difficult to get permanent residency, let alone citizenship.

The Chinese government often considers these new migrants, like previous generations of Chinese sojourners, to be troublemakers. First, many are working in their respective countries illegally. Secondly, Chinese gangs run online casinos and other questionable activities like [phone scams](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/phone-scammers-exposed-web-deceit-across-region-scam-town-china-11394844) targeting people in China. While these activities are disliked by residents and the Chinese government, it Is a lucrative source of income for many regional governments.

# MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA: INSECURITY

According to David Shambaugh, China's relations with Southeast Asia starts in 221 BC, when the Qin Empire invade Yue kingdoms in what is now Southern China and Northern Vietnam. This started a 400 year period of conquest and rebellion. By 200 AD Southern China was largely pacified. During this period, Northern Vietnam was occupied from 111BC - 905 AD. Yunnan was incorporated into China in 1382 after the Ming defeated the Dali Kingdom. From 221 BC to the 1700s Southern China experienced waves of Han migration. The migrants assimilated with the local population, and displaced them, pushing some to what is now Southeast Asia.

**FEAR OF LOSING THE JUNGLE WALL**

While there were subsequent invasions, like the invasion of Burma in 1765-69, Chinese expansion and settlement stopped by the Ming Dynasty, and the current dividing line between China and Mainland Southeast Asia took hold. However, the border areas of Southwest China and Mainland Southeast Asia are one cultural and economic region.

The fear of losing the jungle barrier and economic feasibility has stymied efforts to build rail links connecting Southern China to Southeast Asia. The Nanning-Hanoi line is the only rail link connecting Southeast Asia to the outside. The Laotian section of the China–Laos railway is only expected to be completed at the end of 2021.

Here is a list of Chinese invasions and interventions after the first occupation of Vietnam (111BC-905 AD) Dynasty (includes those of Mongol and Manchu dynasties).

1. Mongol Invasions of Vietnam 1258, 1282–1284, 1285, and 1287–88
2. Mongol Invasion of Burma 1277-1287
3. Mongol Invasion of Java 1292
4. Fourth Era of Northern Domination (Vietnam) 1407-1427
5. [Ming Military Pacification of South Sumatra](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493537?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A1c52ae3b12a677c1a25ab020bbb21d33&seq=11#page_scan_tab_contents) 1408 (p11)
6. Sino-Burmese War 1765-69
7. Qing Invasion of Vietnam 1788–89
8. Sino-French War 1884
9. Sino Vietnam War 1979

**SEEKING A BIGGER BROTHER**

Countries in Mainland Southeast Asia have a history of war and conflict. The Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia ended 32 years ago, and the [Thai-Cambodian Temple dispute occurred just 8 years ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12378001).

Secondly, the smallest countries, Cambodia and Laos are dominated by their larger and richer neighbors, Vietnam and particularly Thailand. Thailand makes up 58% of Laos imports and 42% of Laos exports, While Cambodia has a more diversified trade regime. 22% of the Cambodian labor force works in Thailand. As a result, Laos and Cambodia turn to China to balance against their larger neighbors. However, the dominating presence of Chinese interest in Cambodia and Laos concerns both the [Thais](https://www.nationthailand.com/opinion/30370250) and Vietnamese.

# CHINA'S INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS

While the article doesn't mention it, in the 1950-80s, China supported insurgents and Communist parties throughout the region. And in the case of [Myanmar still does.](https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/guest-column/china-myanmar-no-interference.html) With regards to the countries that didn't recognize her until the 1970s like Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines, the official stance is don't acknowledge it ever happened. With Cambodia, [the Chinese have convinced the Cambodians not to mention China's support of the Khmer Rouge.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/10/xi-jinping-fake-history-lesson-hun-sen-china-cambodia-khmer-rouge/)

While for countries like Indonesia and Myanmar, it's more problematic, since documents that call for a suspension or downgrading of ties indicate China's interference. When ties were normalized between China and Indonesia, both parties agreed to disagree on Chinese interference Until recently, academics thought the Chinese had no prior knowledge of the Indonesian Communist Party's (PKI) murder of six generals, but a [Chinese researcher found proof in the archives in Beijing that Mao had discussed the plot with the PKI leadership before the coup](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/01/china-and-sept-30-movement.html) while researching another topic. However, the extent remains a mystery.

# CHINA'S POLICY TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIAN CHINESE: NO MORE DRAMA

In the 1950s, China considered Southeast Asian Chinese a problem that harmed their relations with regional countries. For the early PRC leaders like Zhou Enlai, overseas Chinese meant Southeast Asian Chinese, since they made up 90% of overseas Chinese in the 1950s.

Southeast Asia Chinese[ were mostly merchants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235043811_The_PRC's_Overseas_Chinese_Policy) [who considered themselves superior to the native population and did not assimilate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235043811_The_PRC's_Overseas_Chinese_Policy). They were village money lenders and controlled the rice mills. Until 1900, [most colonial and native governments outsourced to them, tax and the state-regulated opium trade. ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20072417?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Aa797098d4eb56a31bbd4668fb01fab87&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) It is not the type of people, Mao's China wanted to associate themselves with.

**NOTE:** Opium taxes contributed anywhere from 10-50% of tax revenue in 19th century Southeast Asia, whether it was Burma, Siam, Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Singapore, or French Indochina. [It was also important for the beginnings of Chinese capitalism in Southeast Asia,](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20072417?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents)

However, in non-Communist countries where she had diplomatic relations like [Indonesia](https://books.google.com/books?id=w02WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Indonesia+pro-ROC+schools+1950s&source=bl&ots=yEonYf42dS&sig=ACfU3U2en6TnFDqxSU2EyllbFngVLkRCHA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMmOyo5rrvAhWUHzQIHb_oAFoQ6AEwD3oECA8QAw#v=onepage&q=Indonesia%20pro-ROC%20schools%201950s&f=false), [Myanmar](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/In_the_Name_of_Pauk_Phaw/314k7FP10cYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ROC+chinese+schools+Burma&pg=PA66&printsec=frontcover), Cambodia, and Laos but had active KMT support among the Chinese community, she backed pro-CCP elements. From the modern Chinese perspective, the ethnic Chinese are seen as victims, but to the Indonesian and Burmese, who already had a multitude of problems, the Chinese were just another problem.

[Chinese diplomats manned barricades in West Java, Indonesia in 1959 to stop the expulsion of Chinese families from their rural landholdings.](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Chinese_Policy_Toward_Indonesia_1949_196/oboWNz-7biUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=China+indonesia+relations&printsec=frontcover) China took in 100,000 Chinese Indonesian evacuees from this expulsion, hoping to get young people with technical skills, but instead got middle-aged traders and their families, many of whom could barely speak any Chinese dialect. Even though it was resolved in1960, it worsened relations with elements in the Indonesian government. Then there was the breakdown in relations between China and Vietnam between 1975-79 exacerbated by China's attitude toward Vietnam's persecution of Vietnamese Chinese (Hoa), while at the same time condoning her allies, the Khmer Rouge's genocide of their ethnic Chinese population.

By the 1980s, China realized her past involvement with ethnic Chinese issues yielded little results back home and abroad. Now China is more concerned about protecting citizens and her economic interest in Southeast Asia, which is challenging enough, In Vietnam in 2014, there were anti-Chinese riots due to the South China dispute, 21 Mainland Chinese were killed, Recently, in Myanmar, Chinese factories have been ransacked and destroyed in response to China's suspected involvement in the coup.

# CONCLUSION

The basis of any understanding of China's relations with Southeast Asia and the West should always be trade and economics first, and from there you build a foundation for your strategic and political engagement with China. That is why political geography and critical geopolitics are better at portraying this reality than an IR-centric approach, because it doesn't assume the dominance of the state, or that the state is cohesive. The Chinese state actors had to deal with non-state actors (ex. overseas Chinese) as well as multiple local state actors, the situation can get messy like in Myanmar",geopolitics,Vaccine

15,7 key trends whose inter-play can cause significant global geo-economics turmoil,32.0,q27sl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q27sl8/7_key_trends_whose_interplay_can_cause/,7.0,1633474740.0,"I would like to table 7 key trends that I sense have become more exacerbated and I see them causing significant global geo-economic turmoil in the near future (6 months-1 year),

1. **The** **deflation risk**: The US and other western economy have built up an enormous amount of liquidity as part of COVID economic fallout containment measures. A lot of this liquidity was 'helicopter money' with far less of it going to building up sustained economic activity or infrastructure - resulting in it contributing to higher inflation. Already  inflation in US, UK, Germany, France etc are reporting the highest inflation recorded in 10-30 years. The risk here is that **sustained inflation may lead to lasting and strong demand deflation amongst the world's big consumer markets, adversely impacting businesses and cross-border trade globally**.
2. **The China risk**: Alarming economic news from China - crackdown on tech and businesses had been coming for some time. The current real estate ""crisis"" (if it turns out to be one) - has the risk of erasing significant value trapped in Chinese real estate - which in turn would **lead to significant erosion of consumer confidence, consumption and appetite for lending amongst financial institutions - a recipe for recession**. Obviously given the sheer size of the chinese economy any ""x %"" hit will have global reverberations.
3. The **supply chain risk**: We recently had large media houses such as even CNN reporting about a potential risk of a ""supply chain collapse"". Container shipping rates have gone up by 5-10x and social media is full of alarming visuals of endless cargo ship pile-ups. Given poor customer fulfillment by global supply-chains as well as **increased cost for both manufacturers and consumers**, there is likelihood of fall in demand and supply. Additionally, the b**uilt up inventory as it is released into the market will again lead to a supply glut** which will **suppress demand** and lead to inventory losses for manufacturers. Given that global trade is \~$20 Tn or 20% of global GDP - again a supply chain shock of a ""x %"" hit will cause a massive bill.
4. **The energy risk**: Prices are surging across the fuel spectrum, from Natural gas, Coal to Gas, as economies push to re-start and hit the U-shaped recovery of their economies. However excessive heating of demand can have a whiplash effect due to excessively **high energy costs and cause a demand drop from consumers as well as a supply drop as producers are unable to meet the high energy bill**. China is already resorting to wide-spread power cuts and India is expected to follow suit soon.
5. **The climate risk**: Climate instabilities are manifesting in increasingly starker ways - widespread falls in food production from in Latin American and African nations, prediction of an unexpectedly cold winter this year that will further exacerbate energy demand in the Northern Hemisphere and global water shortages. This again has a **potential to decimate growth, especially in developing economies**.
6. **Covid-2x?**: While vaccinations have clearly ensured that the worst of the COVID crisis is behind us, there are still **possibilities of significant waves, especially in winter**. Threat of a new break-out variant still looms impacting global travel and movement, adding to economic uncertainties. Moreover there have been, unforeseen consequences of mass vaccination such as the Australian trucker strikes, mass firings/resignations in the US of ""non-vaxxers"", etc And even as we try and combat COVID, the **recent case spike seen in Israel, despite almost global high vaccination and vaccination fatigue may mean that COVID still has a potential to cause massive pain to the global economy**.
7. **Geo-political risks**: I distinctly ""feel"" that the world has worsened in terms of geo-political stability v/s pre-COVID. South China sea is at a historic high in terms of tensions and the situations is worsening between China and India in the Himalayas. An Afghanistan under Taliban has apparently opened a Pandora's box in Central Asia, even as there are new tensions between Turko-Azeri alliance and Iran. Most sub-saharan powerhouse economies such as South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia seem to be facing significant internal turmoil. A combative Biden administration is testing nd pushing back an equally combative Putin who recently tested a 2k km range sub-launched hypersonic missile capable of carrying a tactical nuke. Israel's neighborhood seems restive especially given the situation in Lebanon. The only bright spot seem to be the rapprochement between Israel and Gulf countries but even there it is shaping more like an alliance pitted against Turkey. Even in the EU we see small but not insignificant friction between Eastern European nations such as Hungary-Czech-Poland v/s the rest. There is also increasing break-down in co-operation, most notably between UK and Franco.

I welcome your views on the trends listed above,

Do you think I am over-stating their potential to cause havoc?

Do you feel there are other far stronger counter-trends that nullify and stabilize the ones mentioned here?

Do you feel that the window mentioned 6 months-1 year in which we will see a crescendo or at least a local maxima is exaggerated and that these will play out but over a shorter (more painful) / longer time frame (less panful)?",geopolitics,Vaccine

Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.

Many of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took “the White Man’s Burden” seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.

The achievements of the Belgian Congo were financed by the rich reserves of copper in the Katanga province of Congo, and UMHK, an Ango-Belgian conglomerate, sent the bulk of its profits to Europe. The Belgian colonial government deliberately privileged certain ethnic minorities to create ethnic conflict they could manipulate. Above all, the Belgian government saw Africans as little more than big children and presumed they would rule indefinitely. The education made primary education readily available, but only a handful of university graduates. At independence there wasn’t a single African military officer in the police and security forces, and no Africans in the colonial administration with real authority. The Belgians left the Congolese as unprepared as possible for independence.

After independence, the United States supported the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a brutal and corrupt dictator because he was strongly anti-Communist.  At first, the mines ran much as before, with mining output reaching all time highs of around 500,000 tons in the late 1970s. However, the government assumed the period of high commodity prices would last forever, and so did not maintain large financial buffers, or invest in maintenance. Instead, the Congolese elite consumed the wealth with avarice. The fall of the USSR proved a disaster for Mobutu mean the end of vital American support. The power lines that connected the mines in the interior to hydro-electric power plants on the coast were cut by militias, and rioters chased the ethnic minority that held the majority of management jobs in the mines. Mining output decreased from close 500,000 tons of copper to 35,000 in 1993. In 1994, millions of Rwandans refugees fled into the Congo in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, sparking the brutal Congo Wars and putting the final nail in the coffin in the Congolese mining industry.

The DRC’s mining industry has steadily rebuilt itself after the end of the Second Congolese war in 2003. Cobalt has emerged as a key component in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries used in electrical cars. Soaring demand has led to the price of cobalt more than doubling over the last two years to $50,000. While some electric car companies, such as Tesla, are attempting to minimize the use of cobalt, demand is likely to soar in coming years. Whether the Congo benefits from this boom is a more complicated question. About one fifth of the cobalt is comes from artisanal mines, where wages are low and workers as young as seven.  Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who financed the father of the current dictator’s rise to power, controls the allocation of new mining permits. The Inga-Kolwezi transmission lines that connect hydro-power dams at the mouth of the Congo to Katanga only generate power for the mines, but not the surviving villages. While export revenues have soared, it is unclear if Congo has the institutions to transform this into prosperity for ordinary people.

The DRC’s natural resource wealth has not benefited ordinary people because those in charge have little incentive to do so. The Belgians had no incentive to make to Congolese capable of self rule. Mobutu had little incentive to allow the countries resource wealth to benefit those not connected to his regime. The current regime does not seem able to use Congo’s resource wealth in a way that benefits the country. The news stories coming out of Congo are almost universally tragic, whether it is civil war or epidemic. Changing the narrative about the Congo will require reforming the countries institutions. Lets hope this time the Congo manages to do so.

Everyone seems to think KSA has wildly succeeded with the help of Covid 19, but could the oil price (dipping into negative territory) be too low, and demand not enough for even the KSA to survive? Maybe US fracking market share would have been hurt if prices didn't fall so drastically, but with Covid 19 low demand crashed prices, more than a oil glut would have.

To me it's a given that US fracking will be hurt, many companies will go bankrupt and major consolidation will happen. But the fracking equipment isn't going anywhere, they will be liquidated and when prices go back up after Covid 19 they will be put in use by other people. From what I read US fracking is extremely flexible, able to open and close wells in a matter of weeks not months, this bodes well for their withering this temporary storm.

How long can KSA survive such low oil prices? Did Covid 19 push prices beyond what KSA can withstand? Wasn't it just bad timing for MBS plan, given Covid 19 would have had the same effect as his plan, without the risk of being the person to execute the plan. And Covid 19 may have actually made the plan a potential failure.",geopolitics,Vaccine

Regardless of political affiliation, theres a lot to be criticized. There have been poor decisions made medically, socially, and economically. It’s undeniable that many people have died or fallen into dire economic straits due to the pandemic. We’ve also seen an uptick in mental health issues stemming from prolonged isolation. Additional outcomes are more difficult to quantify, and the fallout from others will likely take years to fully manifest. 

Since day one, federal messaging has been inconsistent and often divisive. Guidelines are continually shifting with minimal explanation, and our leadership has not provided a coherent strategy on how individuals and organizations should respond. Politicians on both sides have used the pandemic to virtue signal, and policies often seem more politically than epidemiologically motivated. People are distrustful, scared, confused, or burnt out by the pandemic. Too many are either horrified of the virus to an unreasonable extent, or ignorantly refuse to believe it exists at all. Both Biden and Trump deserve criticism on all fronts. 

We often look backwards with the benefit of hindsight and say what could have been done differently, but leaving all that behind, what are some substantive policies and decisions that you would make as president today in order to better respond to these issues? This is a broad, open-ended question, so I’ll break it down into 4 main categories. 

1. Pandemic response legislation: What policies (EO, through Congress, etc) would you enact in order to decrease Covid related deaths and hospitalizations? 

2. Economic policy: What legislation would you try to pass to jumpstart the slumping economy? This could be on the macroeconomic level, or at the individual level (stimulus check, programs to pay landlords for missed rent, etc). 

3. Federal messaging: This is crucial. How would you go about convincing Americans to trust what the government has to say? How can people be persuaded to follow CDC guidelines or to get vaccinated. If you are skeptical of the CDC/pharma companies, the question still applies. How do you build trust with a wary population? 

4. Instilling hope in the future: How would you inspire the American people to have confidence and belief in the future? Think about what leaders have done in the past during times of great turmoil. The best of them inspire their people to see the light amidst the gloom. How would you paint a luminous vision in the minds of your people? 

Any other ideas are welcome, I just subdivided the prompt to make it easier to respond to. I’m also open to any disagreements on the assumptions I made in this post. For instance, if you do think the government has handled the pandemic well, I would love to hear your opinions. Thank you!",Freethought,Vaccine

I thought it might be worth injecting some evidence back into the current debate about Islam/Islamophobia etc. I have made no judgements here, the evidence is provided for your perusal.

[Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) is the brain and face of Gapminder, and gives awesome talks. He has a half dozen at TED.

But for us it means we have a ton of data at our fingertips.

For example, [here is a graph](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=t1YAVXUoD3iJKy2mSq2Padw;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tyeSLo9Zpmw_e05IR3EoReg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=93$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=23$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) of the **murder rate of women**, with colour coding of countries by religion. 

In the setting of the recent discussions about Islam, the things to notice are twofold. 

The top about ten countries are Christian (even the 2 white bubbles as per Wikipedia). The highest Islamic country is at number 15 if I counted right. The entire top 30 contains about 5 Muslim majority countries.

The other thing to notice is that there is a strong trend between murder of women and poverty. A few outliers to be sure, but the trend is real.

The same relationship between religion and **general murder rate** holds [in general](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=tBrbR3BlR_12WlTIlSTpu6g;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tZgPgT_sx3VdAuyDxEzenYA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=98$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=131$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) although the poverty correlation is weak.

Of course, there is other data that is relevant. **Female literacy** [lags in the impoverished Muslim majority countries](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdE8xR0dUWDI4ME02SjQ5bi1NYnFHN0E;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=24;dataMax=115$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) slightly more than Christian or ""Eastern Religion"" majority countries.

**Fertility rates** [are relatively evenly spread](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) by religion and directly correlate to poverty levels, and [even more closely](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=0ArfEDsV3bBwCcGhBd2NOQVZ1eWowNVpSNjl1c3lRSWc;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=1.8;dataMax=682$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) to **child mortality levels**.

I remember some talk recently of Islam in some areas being against **vaccination** (well, because the US used a fake vaccination program to find out where Osama bin Laden lived in Pakistan). But is it true that Muslim majority countries vaccinate less? [Nope](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=txVTyScWObTBNuMmkNtLh1w;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=99$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=).

Female foeticide is a big problem in highly patriarchal societies, perhaps **gender ratios of children** it could be a decent indicator of gender conflict? The [data suggests](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tfWSVJPJHn3u7e_7MUaCbnw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=88;dataMax=121$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) that in the impoverished world Muslim majority countries are indeed having more male babies delivered, but (and this surprised the hell out of me) are no more unbalanced than *rich* Christian nations.

Of course, India and China are in a far worse position, which is a known and urgent problem. 

Also surprisingly, **age at first marriage for women** is [pretty even](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=t4eF8H_jq_xyKCUHAX6VT1g;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=13;dataMax=34$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) across religions. A few more Muslim majority nations right down the bottom end, but there is almost no difference.

**Whether women work** [does show a significant difference](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=), the lowest rates are almost exclusively in Muslim majority countries.

The one thing I can think of that it doesn't have that I really wish it did was wealth per person and wealth by gender.

I'm keeping this post as a go to for data on religion and various social indicators. Hopefully useful, and remember - Gapminder is awesome!",Freethought,Vaccine
