Where the only food will be genetically modified or synthetically lab produced. Meat and naturally grown food will only be for the globalists. People need to open their eyes.

I stand with the Dutch farmers  💪🏻

They are fighting against the WEF who are taking steps to seize their land by stopping them farming.

Meanwhile in SRI LANKA -  The newly installed WEF President is simply more of the same. He has vowed to crackdown on ‘fascist’ protests. He means his own people, desperately trying to stop the globalist experiment that was originally responsible for destroying farming and their economy. 

Bill Gates and his WEF friends are infiltrating and buying up farms around the world, while Western governments are bribing farmers to retire.

In July 2019, the WEF explained how global farming can take on climate change. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/agriculture-climate-change-solution/

*How's the protecting jobs part going*? https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-to-fight-climate-change-in-agriculture-while-protecting-jobs

Apparently, across these two articles, we need to ""re-examine"" (in 2019) the relationship between agriculture and climate and begin a ""just transition"" to new forms of agriculture, embodied in principle in the Green New Deal. *How's that going*? 

The video is about Germany's ""Just Transition"" to a life after coal. *How's that working out*? https://youtu.be/9EmsA7wG2lo

The second article links to this Malthusian charmer, which openly advocates for lowering fertility rates, among other suggestions. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/how-to-sustainably-feed-10-billion-people-by-2050-in-21-charts

I quote *""2. limiting meat consumption to 52 calories per day by 2050""* and *""4. Achieve replacement level fertility rates""*?

**They've been planning this disaster for a while!** https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/our-food-system-is-at-risk-of-crossing-environmental-limits-here-s-how-to-ease-the-pressure

Check out the section on *""stronger regulation of water and fertilizers""*. If they cant buy your farm, they'll make it prohibitively expensive to produce or operate. Only corporately ran farms will be eligible for support, at least until they collapse the privately owned ones. 

Another reason why they wanted lockdowns, most small businesses operate in the food and restaurant sector, bankrupting these small businesses limits everyone's availability of food at the same time it stops the farmer selling to the restaurant, interrupting this self sustained micro economy. 

This is just from WEFs own website, I hope this answers any doubts on the ensuing food collapse! When one company holds so much power, but comes from the richest and oldest families of the world. You need to question what their agendas are! Controlling the media, farming, land, banking, medications, food supply and now plagues. **Wake up**!",conspiracy,climate change
7,9/11 and the Mandela Effect,3907.0,j6tnm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j6tnm9/911_and_the_mandela_effect/,824.0,1602086887.0,"You’ve probably seen the meme that says we’re living in the wrong timeline[.](https://imgur.com/a/1u1iy9Z) While this sounds like a joke, there might be some truth to it. There are some researchers who claim what happened on 9/11 was a temporal event that caused our timeline to split in two. Supposedly there is a parallel world where the Twin Towers still exist and the apocalypse is being avoided. This is not to say I think we are living in the wrong timeline, but that is something I will get into in another thread. Just know that there is still hope.

[Perhaps the darkest timeline is needed for some collective shadow work.](https://preview.redd.it/6t6vcii9sor51.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8cbbba6a7c0457feb36c380dc20ab2974967a31)

However, I do think our timeline has been altered and probably more times than once. While this is not something you can really prove, there are many oddities surrounding 9/11 as well as a synchronistic pattern hidden in pop culture that seems to point to this. In the movie Back to the Future, after the protagonist accidentally activates a time machine and alters the future, the Twin Pines Mall becomes the Lone Pine Mall. Notice how the clock reads 9:11 when flipped upside down.

[134 reads like hel when flipped upside too. Are we living in a bardo state like in the movie Jacob's Ladder or the show The Good Place?](https://preview.redd.it/mpvjh0olsor51.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b627f229519b5dd69408ae343894d17a2c304401)

Was this a reference to the Mandela Effect and the Twin Towers becoming the One World Trade Center? In the second Back to the Future movie, the protagonists accidentally create a new timeline where a wealthy man named Biff takes over their town. Biff lives in a skyscraper casino and turns their town into a chaotic dystopia. According to the screenwriter Bob Gale, Biff was based on Donald Trump. This is not a political statement, I’m just saying it’s odd how things turned out.

[I wonder if Bob Gale knew Trump would run for president?](https://preview.redd.it/8bo9ufr6tor51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c67c76d0be49e4d19a4cb080d7b1326eb994343e)

In the Super Mario Bros. movie, a meteorite impact millions of years ago caused the universe to split into two timelines, the one we live in, and one where dinosaurs evolved into a humanoid race. President Koopa, a reptilian human hybrid, seems to be another caricature of Trump. President Koopa wants to merge his dimension with ours and attempts to rule Manhattan from the Twin Towers, which are portrayed as a gateway between worlds. The Super Mario franchise is strange when you think about shamans eating mushrooms to commune with serpent gods.

[Looks kind of similar, right?](https://preview.redd.it/qsuztr05uor51.jpg?width=933&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=007cb9d5ff5b3a443a6cf50b368cb3606b28ec7f)

There are many more examples of the WTC acting as a gateway. In an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Twin Towers are used to transmit energy that propels the earth into another dimension. Take note of the sphere between the buildings, this will become relevant later. In the intro of Power Rangers: Time Force, a machine called the Time Shadow is seen standing on the towers. Take note of the moon in the background as well. This will become relevant too. During the final scene of Fringe season 1, the WTC is seen intact in a parallel universe.

Another interesting example can be found in Star Trek. In the show, space explorers are sent back in time to stop an alien invasion in the 1940s that altered the outcome of WWII and allowed the Nazis to invade the US. Once they kill the alien leader, one of the characters tells the protagonist that the timeline has corrected itself just as an image of the Twin Towers burning passes in the background.

[From Star Trek: Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/u5o4vercvor51.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b5d42d00e4e8e46a1c1f31565948aa51caa78f2)

The idea of a parallel world where the Nazis won WWII is very prominent in pop culture. But why is this? Is it possible creative people can intuitively sense other realities while absorbed in the act of creating? Philip K. Dick believed that’s what he did when he wrote The Man in the High Castle. He claimed:

*""I in my stories and novels sometimes write about counterfeit worlds. Semi-real worlds as well as deranged private worlds, inhabited often by just one person…. At no time did I have a theoretical or conscious explanation for my preoccupation with these pluriform pseudo-worlds, but now I think I understand. What I was sensing was the manifold of partially actualized realities lying tangent to what evidently is the most actualized one—the one that the majority of us, by consensus gentium, agree on.""*

Coincidentally, Philip K. Dick was one of the first modern thinkers to predict the Mandela Effect. He once declared:

*“we are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs.”*

The Nazis were rumored to be in possession of a time machine known as Die Glocke, or in English, The Bell. They were supposedly taught how to build this device by extraterrestrials and the craft was said to be kept in a facility known as Der Riese, or The Giant. It sounds far fetched, but The Nazi Party was actually formed from The Thule Society, an occult group that dabbled in channeling and other magical practices. They were also known to use the Black Sun symbol, an esoteric representation of a gateway into another dimension.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Sun\_(symbol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_(symbol))

In Twin Peaks, a show about a small town caught in the midst of an interdimensional battle between good and evil, there seems to be a reference to Die Glocke. In season 8 there is a device that looks just like it, and at one point, a character called The Giant appears next to it.

[A conception of Die Glocke compared to the mysterious bell device in Twin Peaks.](https://preview.redd.it/gd4ml7mxvor51.jpg?width=710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df988856910a7ac4cd6bb2690d82a83ea3599bc8)

Twin Peaks is full of occult symbolism. In one episode a character is given instructions to find a portal that opens 253 yards east of Jack Rabbit’s Palace at 2:53 pm on October 1st. This portal is located in Washington. However, there is another in Las Vegas. Strangely enough, on October 1st, 2017, the Las Vegas shooting occurred in a lot 253 yards away from the Luxor Hotel, a giant black pyramid with the strongest beam of light in the world shooting out of it. Victims were mostly those attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival.

[There's also black pyramids on the instructions.](https://preview.redd.it/l5at0s4mwor51.jpg?width=876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee1f4f6c3965b08fc775919b0e8daeeae4f5f16d)

But it gets stranger. Jason Aldean was one of the headliners. If you look at his tattoos, there’s a Jack card and an Ace card underneath a black sun, which as mentioned earlier, is an occult symbol that represents a portal. This card from the Illuminati game is almost identical. A Jack is worth 10 points. An Ace is worth 1 point. This odd coincidence seems to be a reference to the date 10/1. Keep in mind this date looks like the number 101. This will become relevant too. But was the Route 91 Harvest a literal harvest of souls meant to energize a portal?

[This one is too much of a coincidence for me.](https://preview.redd.it/fxe2xktaxor51.jpg?width=543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6733f9fce9bb186b98166d823c10ff325a2ec252)

The name Twin Peaks seems to be a reference to the Twin Pillars, a Masonic concept that originated from the Biblical idea of Boaz and Jachin, two pillars that stood on the porch of King Solomon's Temple. The Twin Pillars can be found in ancient architecture all over the world and are sometimes used in Tarot. They are said to represent a doorway into a higher realm. In this Masonic artwork, you can see the Black Sun between them.

[Jachin, Boaz, and the Black Sun.](https://preview.redd.it/ivg77smxxor51.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cab85308fbc92b75b6c4d02dc7a57b887780fd4)

The Twin Pillars and the gateway in between can be represented by the number 101. In Twin Peaks, the entrance to The Black Lodge, a place that exists in another dimension, is depicted as a rabbit hole between two trees, which resembles a zero between two ones. In George Orwell’s famous novel 1984, Room 101 is a place where people’s worst fears come true. In The Matrix, Neo’s apartment number is 101. Here it’s interesting to note that he escapes the matrix by going in room 303. This year marks 303 years since Freemasonry was founded. Perhaps they will make their getaway come December? Many occult researchers claim the Twin Towers were supposed to represent the Twin Pillars. There even used to be a statue called The Sphere placed in between them, making the buildings resemble the 101 Gateway.

[The Black Lodge entrance from Twin Peaks and The Sphere centered between the Twin Towers.](https://preview.redd.it/7vkjantoyor51.jpg?width=1082&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2de6642831b124f565eaf68d00896721f29dd4d8)

Is it possible that the WTC‘s design was intended to create an interdimensional doorway using sacred geometry? Some say the Twin Towers even acted as a tuning fork. The buildings were wrapped in aluminum alloy with a resonant hollow interior. If you look at the picture above and to the right, you can kind of see how the sides of the towers even look like one. The Colgate Clock also once faced the WTC from across the water. If you’ve read my previous threads, you’ll probably notice it’s octagonal shape. Many portals in pop culture are portrayed as being 8 sided, like CERN, the largest particle collider in the world. Many conspiracy theorists speculate CERN is actually an interdimensional doorway. Some of the scientists working there have even said this. Why is there so much symbolism? Can it all really be just a coincidence at this point? Did 9/11 really alter our timeline?

[The Colgate Clock compared to CERN.](https://preview.redd.it/x8uqzf9rzor51.jpg?width=829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0403b2dc9be03d1db2963bca5f973278831b92e)

According to many people, 9/11 is the reason the Statue of Liberty’s torch is closed. However, this isn’t true. Lady Liberty’s torch has been closed for over 100 years. Yet, there are some people who claim to have visited it. But according to official history, this is impossible. In this reality, The Black Tom Explosion was the reason the Lady Liberty’s torch closed. The explosion occurred in 1916 and was one of the first foreign attacks on US soil prior to Pearl Harbor. The explosion was also one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever documented. The explosion was so powerful it caused the outer wall of Jersey City's city hall to crack and the Brooklyn Bridge to shake. Ironically, besides Lady Liberty’s torch, the explosion lodged shrapnel in the clock tower of The Jersey Journal building, stopping the clock at 2:12 am. It also caused windows miles away in Times Square to shatter. Perhaps the matrix was trying to tell us something. Was this a time shattering event?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Tom\_explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tom_explosion)

[https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d103887-r126254125-Statue\_of\_Liberty-New\_York\_City\_New\_York.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d103887-r126254125-Statue_of_Liberty-New_York_City_New_York.html)

Some people also claim they remember the Statue of Liberty being on Ellis Island. However, it has always been on Liberty Island. Once again, this is not something I recall learning in school. I’m sure some people do, but if my theory is correct, it’s because only some people in this timeline are from the old one. However, you can still find what appears to be residue left over from the previous reality.

[Residue from a previous reality?](https://preview.redd.it/h1aatrby0pr51.jpg?width=1087&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=147f204eccf3f45405ba44d3fd34f94a7316b098)

There are references in pop culture that seem to hint at the connection between the Mandela Effect and Lady Liberty as well. In the video game Assassin’s Creed Unity, the protagonist must find an exit portal to get himself out of a simulation. He finds it on the statue’s torch. In the movie Men in Black II, the statue’s torch is actually a giant Neuralyzer, a handheld device that uses a bright white flash to wipe people’s minds. At the end of the movie, the torch is activated and it illuminates the sky, erasing the memory of everyone in New York City.

[The scenes from Assassin's Creed and Men In Black II](https://preview.redd.it/166lnhsc1pr51.jpg?width=1159&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fbd79632c92ff8625e5ae12448d33deca880caa)

In the Netflix series The OA, a show about people who can jump between parallel universes, the Statue of Liberty shows up a lot. It seems to play an important role that was never really explained due to the show’s sudden cancellation. Some fans have pointed out that in one scene, Lady Liberty is holding her torch in the wrong hand. Some say this was just an error while others think it may have a deeper meaning.

[The Statue of Liberty scene from The OA.](https://preview.redd.it/gnuwo8et2pr51.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8dc1e1afaabdcc696721084e64249ac039a2a2ac)

In The OA, the protagonist searches for The Rose Window, an object she says acts like a portal to other dimensions. I find this very symbolic considering the Twin Pillar symbolism mentioned earlier. Many older cathedrals have huge rose windows centered between two tall towers.

[Old cathedrals with 101 Gateway symbolism built into the architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/t0xn2pd23pr51.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=159d2d98e86cfbeb118b49345acfd18dc0525c20)

If you’ve read my previous threads, you might have already made the connection that the 101 Gateway is another version of the Saturn Stargate. If you’re not familiar with the theory, we live in a simulation controlled by Saturn and the Moon, and The Elite are tying to break out. Our simulated reality is sometimes represented by a cube, and some say The Kaaba is one of these symbolic structures. The Kaaba sits between two pillars underneath a clocktower with a crescent moon on top.

[Kaaba at Mecca.](https://preview.redd.it/l6ccevsd3pr51.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ddb9d2b46d06f437d4146cc07b8d18496a3b7b4)

Ironically, Fritz Koenig, the artist who created The Sphere sculpture between the Twin Towers, said The Kaaba was the inspiration behind his art installation. We can see this symbolism repeated in much of our pop culture as well.  In the video game Fortnite, a giant cube destroys a location called Tilted Towers then forms a portal in the sky. At another point in the game, it is revealed that the cube’s true form is a giant demon named the Storm King. His horns are reminiscent of a crescent moon.

[The second time you fight the Storm King its at a location called Twine Peaks lmao.](https://preview.redd.it/qpyaxton3pr51.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1e9bbd00eb76751715408dacc3863361fb518c9)

But are there anymore significant Mandela Effects associated with the WTC? According to some people, Hurricane Erin never happened in their timeline. If you‘re unaware, like I was until recently, there was a massive hurricane headed right for New York on the morning of 9/11. Because of the events that occurred on 9/11, I understand how Hurricane Erin would be easy to forget. Nevertheless, the storm was strange. Hurricane Erin, which was slightly larger than Hurricane Katrina, received almost no media coverage as she charged toward New York City. On the morning of 9/11, just as the planes were about to hit, Hurricane Erin grew to her largest size, but slowed down and remained almost stationary off the East coast. But right after the WTC fell, she made a sharp right turn and headed back out to sea.

[Hurricane Erin on September 11th, 2001.](https://preview.redd.it/e3c1rj754pr51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c07e6a9c5f7a1af998c15a1b74f211e28882fb57)

Hurricane Erin’s name is also interesting. The name Erin originated from Ériu, a goddess typically seen by the sea playing a harp. I find this curious becau HAARP uses extremely powerful radio frequencies to heat up the ionosphere and create clouds of plasma. Not only does this affect the climate, but the electromagnetic waves produced by it could hypothetically mess with our minds, perhaps changing or even erasing our memories. se many conspiracy theorists blame HAARP for both weather manipulation and the Mandela Effect.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency\_Active\_Auroral\_Research\_Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program)

In my last thread, I talked about MH370. I believe it’s disappearance, like the events discussed in this thread, was a part of a Saturn Stargate ritual. A sacrifice to the god of time. Would it be beyond the god of the fourth dimension to grant someone access to a wormhole? Perhaps The Elite are not purposely creating Mandela Effects and branching timelines. Perhaps it is just a side effect of trying to beak the matrix. But I digress. At the end of my last thread I said I would talk more about rabbit symbolism and its association with time travel. However, before I talk about that, or the Law of One, I thought I should talk about this first. Thanks for reading.

Oh yeah, in case you did read my last thread, check this out. The fact that this article was posted 2 weeks after my MH370 conspiracy post has me kind of spooked lol.

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

**I AM NOT DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE**

I know logic and reason is tough for most people, but if you read this post as a denial of climate change or that I'm somehow advocating that nothing should be done, you're obviously trapped in ideological thinking. Suspend your ideological framework for two seconds and ask yourself: is it hypocritical for a multi billionaire with palaces all over the globe to lecture the poor about necessary sacrifices? Yes or no? Maybe the oligarch who recently became America's largest landowner has some ulterior motive behind championing climate change? The genuine people I know and have known who champion climate change do things like eat a plant based diet, build bio passive thermal homes out of garbage, and bring their personal consumption to a bare minimum.",conspiracy,climate change
12,Please help spread this: Chevron won't let it be published in main stream publications,2538.0,qi4nhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qi4nhi/please_help_spread_this_chevron_wont_let_it_be/,214.0,1635481695.0,"Chevron sent environmental attorney Steven Donziger to prison, in the what’s being called the first-ever case of corporate prosecution.


Steven Donziger sued Chevron for contaminating the Amazon and won. Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18,000,000,000. Yesterday, Donziger went to prison, in the what’s being called the first-ever case of *corporate prosecution.*


Over three decades of drilling in the Amazon, Chevron deliberately dumped more than 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater and 17 million gallons of crude oil into the rainforest. Chevron committed ecocide to save money—about $3 per barrel. Many experts consider it the biggest oil-related disaster in history, with the total area affected 30 times larger than the Exxon-Valdez spill. Chevron created a super-fund site in the Amazon rainforest that is estimated to be the size of Rhode Island. 


Steven Donziger visited Ecuador in 1993, where he says he saw ""what honestly looked like an apocalyptic disaster,"" including children walking barefoot down oil-covered roads and jungle lakes filled with oil. Industrial contamination caused local tribes to suffer from mouth, stomach, and uterine cancers, respiratory illnesses, along with birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages.


As an attorney, Donziger represented over 30,000 farmers and indigenous Ecuadorians in a case against Chevron and *won*. In 2011, Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18 billion. Rather than accept this decision, the company vowed to fight the judgment ""until Hell freezes over, and then fight it out on the ice."" Chevron has been persecuting Steven Donziger for his involvement ever since. In an internal memo, Chevron wrote, “Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger.” 


Chevron sued Donziger for 60 billion dollars, which is *the most any individual has ever been sued for in American legal history*. Over the course of ten years, armed with a legal team numbering in the thousands, the company set out to destroy Donziger. Chevron had Donziger disbarred, froze his bank accounts, slapped him with millions in fines without allowing him a jury, forced him to wear a 24h ankle monitor, imposed a lien on his home where he lives with his family, and shut down his ability to earn a living. Donziger has been under house arrest since August 2019.


Chevron has used its clout and advertising dollars to keep the story from being reported. “I’ve experienced this multiple times with media,” Donziger said. “An entity will start writing the story, spend a lot of time on it, then the story doesn’t run.” This unprecedented legal situation is happening in New York City, the hometown of the New York Times—but the paper has yet to report on the full story.


On October 27, 2021, Donziger entered federal prison for a six-month sentence. He had already spent over 800 days in house arrest, which is *four times longer than the maximum sentence allowed for this charge.* Anyone who cares about the rule of law should be appalled. It is an absolute embarrassment, to our government and to our constitution, that Steven Donziger is imprisoned on US soil.


As the title states, Chevron is in the process of executing the first-ever corporate prosecution in American history. This case sets a terrible precedent for attorneys and activists seeking to hold oil companies liable for pollution. Chevron is pursuing this case—to the benefit of the entire fossil fuel industry—to dissuade future litigation that may call them to account for their role in climate change.


[Lawyer Steven Donziger, Who Sued Chevron over “Amazon Chernobyl,” Ordered to Prison After House Arrest](https://www.democracynow.org/2021/10/27/steven_donziger_judicial_harassment_from_chevron)


[This Lawyer Went After Chevron. Now He’s 600 Days Into House Arrest.](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/03/lawyer-steven-donziger-went-after-chevron-now-600-days-house-arrest/)


EDIT 1: Chevron went after him with a civil RICO lawsuit (accusing him of racketeering) because he’s trying to force Chevron to pay the $18B judgment and follow through with the clean-up. Their “argument” is that Donziger is a fraud who just wanted to extort them for big bucks. They’ve been working hard to paint him as such in the media. Chevron sued him for $60B but then dropped the damages just weeks before because they realized it would necessitate *a jury.* In the proceeding, Judge Kaplan (who had undisclosed investments in Chevron!) ordered Donziger to turn over his computer to Chevron (with decades of client communications!) effectively violating attorney-client privilege which is *the backbone of our legal system*. He refused to comply so the judge charged him with contempt of court. US attorneys declined to pursue the charge (because it was ridiculous!) so Judge Kaplan made the exceedingly rare move to get private law firm Seward &amp;amp;amp; Kissel to prosecute him “in the name of” the US govt. Except Seward &amp;amp;amp; Kissel has Chevron as a major client. So many conflicts of interest it’s insane.


EDIT 2: Chevron wants this to go away quietly. They have done their best to suffocate this story. **Chevron does not want us to draw attention to the ecocide they deliberately committed (and were literally found guilty of!) in the Amazon. They do not want Donziger to become a household name.** They don’t want to create a martyr for the cause against Big Oil. We can foil their plans by signing the MoveOn petition below and making sure this story gets shared widely.

I’ve been unable to post this story on any other sub (many others have also tried and failed) so I’m really grateful to the mods for keeping it posted here.

Changing the definition of a recession is straight out of Orwellian playbook. We are living in a dystopian future. These people will stop at nothing until they have destroyed everything you have come to know. Grocery shelves have been getting gradually emptier in my neighborhood, which is fairly affluent. I have started growing my own food, storing seeds and stockpiling rice and beans. I have about a three month supply right now.

For starters, learn how to grow your own food, how to store it and how to grow lots of it. You can grow food year round no matter your climate. Also look into building a small greenhouse or setting up hydroplonics.

Start a seed vault with organic heirloom seeds. Do not harvest seeds from grocery store fruits and veggies. Corporate food producers literally own the genetic code of their food and can sue you and destroy your food supply. This has been happening to farmers and homesteaders.

Look into your city or town's livestock laws. A chicken lays one egg a day. Four chickens will yield at least two dozen edible eggs a week. A live chicken costs ~$4 and yields up to 300 eggs a year, that's over 30,000 calories. Two weeks of food for one person. Factor in feed, a coop and heat lamps, you can have your very own self sustaining chicken farm for less than $500. The also produce organic fertilizer through their shit, something that is going to be very valuable.

Stock up on calorie dense foods that store well. Rice, beans, lentils, canned proteins like tuna and chicken. 

Lastly, buy a gun and lots of ammo.

We are seeing rapid observable changes to almost every single planet:

1. Pluto's atmosphere has recently collapsed
2. Neptune's storms have suddenly begun rotating backwards
3. Uranus' polar regions are visibly flaring
4. Jupiter has recently experienced a 700 degree temperature impulse originating from its northern pole, and its great red spot is fading
5. Mars is suddenly displaying seismic activity
6. Our own polar regions have warmed drastically recently, the amount of volcanic activity we are seeing is at an all-time high
7. Venus's planetary winds have increased their velocity by 33% in the last 20 years

It goes on from there, we've recently observed:

1. large-scale changes in the ice cover on Jupiter’s moon Europa
2. large-scale changes in the polar ice cap on Mars
3. a large-scale decrease in atmospheric pressure on Venus
4. a mysterious brightening of the atmosphere of Saturn
5. a mysterious darkening of the atmosphere of Venus
6. unusual changes in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere of Neptune
7. a brightening of the atmosphere of Jupiter
8. a mysterious dark spot near the South Pole of Venus

Here on earth, our own magnetosphere is rapidly losing it's strength as our magnetic poles continue to race away from their usual positions, wreaking havoc on animal migrations - see all the beached whales this year as well as the spike in reports of unusual bird sightings.

Things have gotten to the point where we are now updating our magnetic models yearly, and soon there will be zones of flux broken bad enough to cause real danger to flying due to constant magnetic reconnection.

Our aurorae are reaching levels of intensity not normally seen, with recent  high-energy'pink' aurorae being observed.

The fundamental electromagnetic nature of this planet - electromagnetism responsible for a variety of effects on life, most especially cardiac and pulmonary health in humans humans, is changing rapidly.

Volcanic activity on our planet is currently at a record, with more and more volcanoes showing concerning lift, erupting, or showing increases in lava flow. Every single active volcano along the pacific rim is showing increased activity. Mount Rainier looks ready soon. The Sisters in Oregon are showing lift - and then there's volcano mama herself, Yellowstone, showing signs of increasing rumbling.

Given only one of two data points, it woulud be easy to discount the events as isolated and unrelated outliers with no significance.

Taken together, however, the total body of evidence becomes impossible to ignore, and, once the presumption is made that this information is known by our leaders, pretty much explains the motivations for their actions.

Everything is changing. Nobody is telling you. In fact, they built us a world where these questions are taboo, where every answer leads you away from the glaring, obvious truth.

Author and scholar Immanuel Velikovsky claimed that the planets used to move in very different orbits and a close encounter with Saturn once caused a global cataclysm. Velikovsky said this event was the inspiration behind the many myths and legends about gods going to war in the heavens. However, the meanings of these stories became obscured due to something he called cultural amnesia. Now only symbolic fragments of our true history remain.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel\_Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky)

[https://www.everythingselectric.com/eu-theory-saturn-polar-configuration/](https://www.everythingselectric.com/eu-theory-saturn-polar-configuration/)

David Talbott wrote a book based on Velikovsky’s research. In The Saturn Myth, Talbott speculates Earth was once a moon of Saturn. During this time, Saturn would have hung ominously overhead and dominated the sky. He says this is the reason the ancients thought of Saturn as God. He claims this ancient version of Saturn had no rings and was much closer to the sun. He also says Saturn may have been a minor star. So the Earth, technically having two suns, would have had a much different climate. The Earth would’ve existed in a perpetual summer. We supposedly remember this period as the Golden Age. However, it apparently came to an end when some cosmic event caused the planets to rearrange. During this celestial upheaval, Saturn, Venus, and Mars aligned. This alignment supposedly resembled a bridge connecting to Saturn.

[The Saturn, Venus, Mars alignment](https://preview.redd.it/jr8u4ke0qco51.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38f483c3a3341a900561779425cbdc33109c6dd7)

If Saturn was considered God, this alignment would have literally looked like a bridge to God’s dwelling place. Some say this was the real inspiration behind the Tower of Babel story. If you are not familiar with it, it is a biblical tale about a tower so tall it reached up to Heaven. Talbott claims, as the planets aligned, they went through many other configurations, at one point even forming a pupil in a triangle that looked like the all seeing eye. Perhaps this is the reason the symbol is associated with godlike knowledge and power.

[ Sauron, the main antagonist of The Lord of the Rings, seems to symbolize Saturn and its all seeing eye. The title of the series is actually a reference to Sauron, who is also known as The Lord of the Rings. This is also symbolic for more obvious reasons. ](https://preview.redd.it/pxog8crnqco51.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=782f51c916a85bf788bfa6ce69d84a4f9f8f93c5)

 Bull horns, the winged solar disc, and the boat of heaven are other important symbols. According to proponents of this theory, they actually represent Saturn’s crescent. Some say Satan represents Saturn, and perhaps this is where the idea of the devil having horns came from. In ancient mythology, Saturn sails the primordial waters in a celestial boat. Some say this is the true meaning of the Ark of the Covenant. Tracy Twyman noted that the celestial boat was sometimes called a chariot and The Bible calls the Ark of the Covenant the Chariot of God.

[Saturn's crescent compared to the celestial boat carrying the sun disc](https://preview.redd.it/b9xvsv10rco51.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51745a8e5dad88ed8476ab0319d7957f12e28a56)

Tracy Twyman was an independent investigator. She wrote at least six books, most of them dealing with occult knowledge. She was found hanged in her garage at age 40. However, many of her fans do not buy the story. At one point she hinted at the possibility of being gang stalked after her computer was hacked.

Saturn’s Ship also seems to be represented by the Boat of Ra, and the Eye of Ra seems to be an earlier version of the all seeing eye. Ra was an ancient Egyptian sun God. Remember to keep in mind Saturn may have been our original sun while connecting all of these dots. The Boat of Ra also looks oddly similar to the modern day depiction of a wormhole. This might sound like a stretch, but in the same way a wormhole might be used to travel between dimensions, Ra‘s boat was used to travel between worlds.

In the movie Stargate, the military opens a wormhole that leads to a distant planet. When they decide to go in and explore the strange new world, they encounter a godlike being named Ra. Notice how the headdress looks just like Saturn’s crescent.

[Ra from the movie Stargate](https://preview.redd.it/s8chsqsvrco51.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69c28cad91dfa077614feef51b272e006517938d)

Another important symbol associated with the Saturn, Venus, Mars alignment is the 8 spoked wheel. Below, you can see the god Saturn holding one. Just like the celestial boat, the 8 spoked wheel seems to be associated with wormholes and other worlds.

[Saturn holding an 8 spoked wheel](https://preview.redd.it/pynimq96sco51.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f67088f6d6f7f8a11cd89eaef073b0962a1637d0)

The octagonal portal motif can also be seen in Stargate as well as many other movies. But even stranger is the fact that CERN, the largest particle accelerator in the world, resembles an 8 spoked wheel. Many conspiracy theorists claim CERN is a doorway to another world. This would sound far fetched if it wasn’t for the fact that the scientists who work at CERN openly admit they’re looking for other dimensions. They’ve even nicknamed the machine the Tower of Babel. Oddly enough, CERN also resembles the Mayan calendar. According to Mayan mythology, there will come a time when a celestial alignment causes a cosmic doorway to open. Out of this doorway will come a serpent with an enlightened being named Quetzalcoatl riding on its back. When it comes through the doorway, the serpent will supposedly spew a blessed substance called Itz all over Earth. But what is Itz? And could this serpent represent something else? If you’ve read my thread about the plasma apocalypse you might be connecting some dots right now.

Some researchers say CERN was even built to mirror certain celestial bodies. The particle accelerator at CERN consists of two loops. The size difference between the two loops is proportionally equal to the size difference between the Earth and the moon with 99% accuracy. In his work, Goro Adachi points out many more correlations between CERN and the planets Mercury, Venus and Mars, as well as the constellation Orion. Was CERN designed to be a microcosm of the celestial alignment that once caused a wormhole to form in the sky?

Some physicists claim black holes are just one end of a wormhole. Ironically, Saturn was called the Black Sun. The Black Sun symbol was used by the Nazis to show their source of occult power. The symbol, as well as the swastika, actually originated from the 8 spoked sun wheel. There are many references to the Black Sun in pop culture. In the Wolfenstein series, the Black Sun, which resembles a black hole, is a portal used by the Nazis to enter another dimension. In the game, the Black Sun also caused the destruction of the ancient civilization Thule.  In Rogue One, the Death Star resembles a black sun. Ironically, when viewed up close, the Death Star looks just like Saturn’s moon Mimas. The music video for Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden also depicts a black hole opening in the sky that starts destroying the planet.

Many people have pointed out that the hypothetical Saturn, Venus, Mars alignment also looks like a keyhole. Perhaps humans subconsciously chose to associate this shape with doorways for this reason. Many movies also use the keyhole to symbolize a portal to another world. The keyhole configuration also seems to be encoded in both ancient and modern architecture. For example, the Vatican, when viewed from above, looks like a keyhole. Perhaps these structures, like CERN, were built to mirror certain celestial alignments as well. But why do this? Perhaps there is something magical about creating on Earth, what is in Heaven. Remember the hermetic axiom as above, so below. Perhaps the information encoded into these structures quantum entangles its Earthly location with its Heavenly counterpart.

[Ariel view of the Vatican \(far right\) compared to keyhole symbolism in movie posters and the hypothetical Saturn, Venus, Mars alignment](https://preview.redd.it/0pfh10aewco51.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=920a3d8c9d2750b88bda7e0554d43997ca78b9af)

But how would it be possible for a planetary configuration to create a portal? Perhaps the portal has always been there. On top of Saturn there is a hexagon that some scientists suggest might be the side effect of a gravitationally stabilized wormhole inside the planet.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s\_hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkXFldVQf4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkXFldVQf4c)

There are many references to a Saturnian portal in pop culture. In Interstellar, there’s a wormhole next to Saturn that takes the protagonists to new worlds. In Planet of the Apes there’s an electromagnetic storm near Saturn that sends the protagonist to another version of Earth. In the video game Observation, an astronaut goes into the hexagon on top of Saturn and is taken to a place where multiple universes converge. If you’ve read my posts about Saturn and its connection to cubes and simulation theory, you might be connecting some dots here as well. Is Saturn’s hexagon the portal that once opened up in the sky? Is Saturn’s hexagon the stargate that takes us to higher realms? Ironically, in Tron: Legacy, the protagonists escape the simulation they are trapped in by going into a pillar of light that looks just like it.

[Saturn's hexagon \(bottom left\) compared to the pillar of light from Tron: Legacy](https://preview.redd.it/ep2qt17exco51.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc8c166923444bf73ab106c5162e2dc90447ba22)

It’s also interesting to note that at the very beginning of The Matrix, right before you are shown the simulated reality the main character resides in, there is a flash of light that looks like Saturn. Was this a coincidence? A synchronicity? Or was it intentional?

[Opening scene of The Matrix](https://preview.redd.it/8ql5q9mmxco51.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a326cb3d594318a109d9a34f24d9d9c6131e8ac4)

I believe the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey gives the us the most insight into the Saturn Stargate theory. At the beginning of the movie, there is even a scene that depicts one of the planetary configurations discussed earlier.

[A scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey \(center\) compared to the Saturn, Venus, Mars alignment \(left\) and the all seeing eye \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/cjusvtzsxco51.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3af0b89f05e66a4e6925c70a00e5e250ec47264c)

The movie is about Bowman, an astronaut on his way to Jupiter, and his conflict with a sentient computer named HAL who controls his spaceship. However, as you read, keep in mind that the original destination was supposed to be Saturn but this detail was changed last minute due to the special effects team being unable to create a convincing rendition of Saturn's rings. Throughout the movie, HAL tries to stop Bowman from completing his mission and kills his crew in the process. Interestingly, HAL resembles an all seeing eye and his name is a Coptic word that literally means simulation. The Gnostics used this word to describe the material world.

[HAL, the all seeing eye](https://preview.redd.it/ueppy9nfyco51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5127749538578a945cd7175802ef94a391dca4bf)

After Bowman finally deactivates HAL, he arrives at Jupiter where he sees a massive black cube-like structure called a Monolith floating in its orbit. The mysterious object pulls him into a vortex of colored light that takes him to another dimension beyond space and time. If you’re familiar with my work, you know I believe the black cube represents the false reality we reside in. At the end of the movie, he is reborn as a being made of light and looks over the Earth. In my opinion, this movie is about the path to enlightenment and escaping the simulation. Similarly, at the end of Interstellar, after the main character goes into a black hole, he travels into the future to a time where there’s a civilization orbiting Saturn. There he finds televisions resembling Monoliths that replay a documentary about life on Earth over and over. This seems to imply the protagonist escaped the simulation’s time loop by going into the Black Sun, also known as the Saturn Stargate, and entered a higher dimension. Are all the theories I’ve been posting creating one coherent narrative yet? I don’t know.

[The ending of Interstellar](https://preview.redd.it/98t3r1cxyco51.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a089b5d0e900257f360683f5c6f0892ccc027b79)

Is the Saturn Stargate the same portal that opens up during the plasma apocalypse? Is the Saturn Stargate the same portal one ascends through to leave this virtual reality? There is no way to prove any of this, but it is fun to speculate. However, I’d like to end with this. According to the Law of One, a documented series of supposed conversations between a professor of physics and a channeled entity known as Ra, there is a council who lives in Saturn’s rings who keep this planet quarantined from the rest of the universe. Remember how Ra represents Saturn? According to Ra, there is a great harvest of souls coming soon. Saturn was also known as the God of Harvest. There’s even a scene in Space Odyssey that seems to hint at this event. This will be the topic of my next thread! Thanks for reading!

The conspiracy is this: we humans have been civilized for far longer than 6,000 years. We have in fact lived through many world ages, rising from dust to greatness, only to be cut down again by calamity.

We exist on a planet of recurring calamity, where every 12,000 years or so, a great cataclysm strikes this planet. The sun is the cause of this cataclysm.

The oldest literature in the world, the Vedas tell us that this world is cyclical, with great ages called yugas, where humans advance in consciousness until they reach a golden age. 

Eventually the cycle swings back down, to the kali Yuga or iron age, the age we are on the verge of exiting out of now.

The borders of these ages, the crossings, are periods of cataclysm and calamity, were the old world is essentially destroyed, the old energies wiped away, to make room for what's next.

We are on the precipice of such a time. Our magnetic poles are shifting, and the sun is becoming more active. It will continue to increase in ferocity, until eventually the flash will come. 

The flash is a massive solar flare and coronal mass ejection. For a more detailed description, see any prophecy about the end of the world. It's in the Bible, in Mayan texts, Hopi prophecy, and others. They all describe similar events. 

Revelation describes the sun turning black and the moon turning red. This is pretty much what one would expect to see from a hyperactive sun - massive sunspots, making the sun's center black. 

A direct hit of solar plasma would melt the regolith on the moon, generating small glass particles, which would glow red while they were still hot. Interestingly enough, our moon missions found quite a bit of this type of glass in lunar regolith.

The fact that this event is going to happen is the biggest, best kept secret ever. The elite know it, and they are sworn to secrecy using the most awful and evil ways imaginable. 

Where do you think our trillions went exactly? That money is all underground, as a massive network of bunkers and underground bases we have been building non-stop for the last 50 years. 

All conspiracies lead back to this. Climate change itself is a red herring, a conversation made to only have a couple of resolutions while keeping attention as far away from possible from the actual issue - keep them arguing about whether or not they did it, and they'll never bother to look up and look for another reason.

If you think I'm crazy, then look at the stars closest to the Sun and check to see whether they flared recently. They all have. 

If you still think I'm crazy, then look at what Neptune is doing right now. Then look at Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Venus. Every single one of them is experiencing major climate changes right now.

Pluto has lost its atmosphere, collapsed. Scientists don't know why
Uranus is showing storms that are moving backwards
Neptune's temperature is all off. Scientists can't explain it.
Saturn's rings are changing
Jupiter's Great Storm is changing fast, new storms are popping up
Mars is experiencing global warming, and now earthquakes
Venus's planetary winds are now spinning 33% faster

If you've ever wondered why the elite do what they do, or why commodities seem to be going scarce, one after the other, or why governments are essentially acting like they don't give a f*** about their people, or really anything that has no explanation, then try and apply this hypothesis and see what you get. I think you'll find it fits just about everything.",conspiracy,climate change

Looking at it through the lens of a hollyood elite, these messages become less like a bipolar episode and more like a man who has been exposed to so much toxicity he is now on the breaking point and faces many major life decisions in the coming days.

I made a separate post about the Bill Cosby tweet

Kanye is constantly trying to tell people that his family does not have his or his kids best interests at heart.  He claims that Kris Jenner leaked the OG Kim Kardashian sextape in order to gain fame for herself, essentially pimping them out.  Now they are trying to do the same.  Kanye goes on to list others, linking them together with the thinking emoji.  These people include rap artist Drake and Larsa Pippen, wife of Scottie Pippe.  Kim K is goddaughter to Pippen's daughter, showing how close the families actually are.

All of these families that associate with Kanye through Kardashian connections, as well as Drake, have been accused of the same thing Kris has.  EVERY SINGLE ONE of These people have mixed race children that are groomed from a young age to fuck around with celebrities so the parents can remain famous.   Drake on numerous occasions has been accused of grooming girls and then getting handsy on their 18th birthday.   Larsa recently posted a risque photo of her  and her 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER to ig.  I saw the pic and before I knew the age I thought she was like 20.  Look at the photo and tell me that isn't ridiculous.

Recently, the entire Kardashian family disassociated themselves with Larsa due to the allegations that she had sex with Tristan Thompson, an NBA player dating Khloe Kardashian at the time.  I believe the real reason is that Kanye demanded Kim and he separate from the family due to the toxic behavior, and has constantly been at odds with Kris on how his children should be raised.  He has said he does not want his kids to end up in sex tapes or doing playboy shoots like how everyone else in the family has done and wants them to.    Not scared to put his foot down and speak up despite threats from the Kardashians that they are going to lock him up ""for his safety"".  All he doing is tweeting and people are acting like he is clinically insane.

This ties in to Kanye's allegation that Kim came on to rapper Meek Mill when they met to discuss prison reform last year. Originally cheating allegations, he later said Meek was respectful and Kim was not.  He is slowly beginning to see things through his newfound christian lens and is seeing all the evil within Hollywood for the first time.  He does not want his kids to go through all of this, or to have to watch out for the groomers that fill his world.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Kris Jong Un"" --- dictator?  liar? starving kids for looks?  This one is very speculative

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------

The MJ tweet was interesting, because while it is worth noting that the Kardashian grandmother is named MJ, he also could be talking about the Michael Jackson death and the conspiracies surrounding it.  This is because he mentions ""Tommy"" and how he killed the aforementioned MJ. Kanye is showing that the problems are systemic and widespread in nature, not to just his family or career.

This is in reference to Tommy Mottola, who was CEO of Sony Music at the time.

According to his contract, Michael Jackson was supposed to gain the master recording licenses for his music in the early 2000's, but Mottola was doing everything in his power to keep the rights and was constantly pressuring him for the rights to his music catalog.  While in court, it was argued that Sony was trying to tank his career to force MJ to sell rights to his music for a cheap price.  It was also discovered that his lawyer was also working for the Sony corporation at the same time, providing a clear conflict of interest and allowing him to exit his contract.  While his next album Invincible did well, the zero support from Sony and sabotage of any promotion he attempted hurt US sales greatly.

MJ claimed that the company sabotaged black artists and used them only for financial gain, not caring about the well being or careers of those they use.  He would go on to publicly criticize Sony for the rest of his life.

Shortly before his death, son Prince Jackson spoke of how people wanted to harm MJ .

from a 2013 CNN article:

*""After he got off the phone, he would cry,"" Prince Jackson testified. ""He would say 'They're going to kill me, they're going to kill me.'""*

*His father told him he was talking about AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips and his ex-manager, Dr. Tohme Tohme, Prince said.*

*Prince said that was his last conversation with his father.*

*Prince recounted the day his father died four years ago. He saw his father ""hanging halfway off the bed, his eyes were rolled back,"" when he ran into the bedroom where Dr. Murray was doing CPR in a futile effort to revive him, he said.*

*Paris followed him up the stairs, ""but we kept pulling her down the stair,"" he said.*

*""She was screaming the whole time saying she wants her daddy,"" he said.*

*At the hospital later, Dr. Murray told them ""Sorry kids, your dad's dead,"" Prince testified.*

*Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. The coroner ruled the singer died of an overdose of the drug.*

*AEG Live executives allegedly created a medical conflict of interest that pressured Murray to pursue the dangerous treatments so Jackson would be rested for rehearsals, while ignoring warning signs that his health was failing, Jackson family lawyers argue.*

&#x200B;

MJ had said previously that he did not trust his manager, and he did not like how everything was done through him.  Was AEG and his manager in kahoots with Sony music?   At the very least they both cared more about money then they did him.

But how does this link to Kanye?

These music companies want their artists to make them money and they dont care about anything else.  When Kanye says things like this in an attempt to expose him, the first thing they wanna do is drug him up and put him back in the studio.

He also mentions Righteous Indignation as a form of white supremacy

Cracker + Righeous = Crigheous  AS KANYE TYPED ABOVE

Righteous indignation is typically a reactive emotion of anger over mistreatment, insult, or malice of another. It is akin to what is called the sense of injustice.

**This is how they keep the black man down.  Keep people outraged about trivial things and distract them from the real issues in the world.  The real problems in the industry.   If you tell people enough times that they are unequal or discriminated against they start to believe it.   Drug them when they step out of line and toss them aside when the checks run out.  Kanye is realizing he is pawn in a bigger game, and now that he has all these roots in the game such as Yeezy or the Gap or his music, too many people cant risk (Afford) a Kanye who speaks his mind.**

&#x200B;

""Get Out is about me"" - They don't want Kanye to break the cycle and be different because different is dangerous to profit.  How will they sell North West cosmetics in 20 years if Ye keeps tweeting like this?

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

34,"Did You Know That On July 28, 2020 The Rockefeller Foundation Published A Document Called “Reset The Table” ? It’s all about the upcoming food shortages.",946.0,vjclrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vjclrn/did_you_know_that_on_july_28_2020_the_rockefeller/,101.0,1656034371.0,"by [threadsirish](https://threadsirish.substack.com/p/did-you-know-that-on-july-28-2020)

On July 8 2020, a little known document was published by The Rockefeller Foundation called “Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System”.

[https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RF-FoodPolicyPaper\_Final2.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RF-FoodPolicyPaper_Final2.pdf)

This document flew under the radar for many but is now more important than ever in the light of what has been happening to food processing facilities being destroyed globally and herds of cattle being culled.

The first question anybody should be asking is “How would the Rockefeller Foundation know about upcoming food shortages” in 2020. Naturally it was just a calculated guess on their part. Isn’t it also interesting that the title was “Reset the Table”

Surely just another coincidence considering “The Great Reset” was announced on 3rd June 2020. Amazing how they can get all their ducks in a row lined up so quickly considering Covid had only officially been on the block for a few months.

We shouldn’t be remotely surprised with the documents they publish considering in 2010 they published a document called Scenarios For The Future Of Technology and International Development in which they accurately predicted the covid outbreak. If you haven’t read the document I recommend you do. I wrote an article on it entitled

**Why Did The Rockefeller Foundation Publish A Document in 2010 That Is Eerily Similar To Events That Are Taking Place Today in Covid Times ?**

which gives a snapshot overview of the document

As I have mentioned before The Rockefeller Foundation is also deeply involved in the move to a Digital ID, cashless society and social credit score system

[**threadsirishWhy Are The World Economic Forum (WEF) & Rockefeller Foundation (RF) So Intent On Implementing A Digital ID, Digital Currency & Social Credit Score System ?Read more**6 months ago · 4 likes · threadsirish](https://threadsirish.substack.com/p/why-are-the-world-economic-forum?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

But what about “Reset The Table”. What can we take from it ? Actually, quite a lot. Before I jump into the document itself, it’s important to look at ties to the World Economic Forum (WEF) of which there are many. Many of those who contributed to the document have conflicts of interest (Pages 21-23 of the document)

Global food companies such as Danone and Mars

American Heart Association who are dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke (the irony)

**T**he US Food and Drug Administration

Johns Hopkins University

[https://www.weforum.org/organizations/johns-hopkins-university](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/johns-hopkins-university)

This is the same Johns Hopkins who published a document predicting The SPARS Pandemic

Then there are the inevitable links to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Any university on the list has more than likely received funding. In the case of Tufts University who has received millions one of the funding areas is for “Agriculture Development” and “Nutrition”.

&#x200B;

Duke University has also received hundreds of millions

You get the point at this stage. The ties are everywhere, just go to Pages 21-22 to see the full list of contributors to the report and the companies they work for.

Onto the document itself. Naturally it’s dressed up as being beneficial to mankind but once you dig deeper the truth begins to emerge of the real plans.

The one page foreword written by Dr Rajiv J Shah and especially its opening sentence is really quite telling (Page 2)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0j2y9zu62h791.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=737c975991f0d060f4ad9a45c5bf9bd398f83fd3

It then goes on

The finger is firmly being pointed at Covid 19 for causing many of the food problems. That’s quite amazing considering Covid had only been around for a few months when this report was written.

Shah then continues to say

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idjyi9xa2h791.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1a68e5477b5c4b7ecee1c9f60608e27fcbd557bd

Equitable and sustainable seem to be very much part of UN Agenda 2030. This comprehensive playbook he refers to would naturally include UBI as being part of the solution. They admit to trying to change the system for years but ignore the question “Cui Bono” or who benefits.

Amazingly they admit and knew back in 2020 that 94% of people dying from Covid had underlying health conditions, predominantly being diet related. (Page 3)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wssdjzlc2h791.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd8c535b2ce32e5a92ada385fc3661d6589e76b4

Let’s not forget that The Rockefeller Foundation is partly to blame for the state of food and people’s health in US over the last few decades in particular. They even admit this themselves (Page 4)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kkpyca7e2h791.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70146a5f5dfb49bf7879033dcb17be8195b073ef

The document is very much framed in the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution. Here is the problem that they have created (Covid) and now they want to implement the solution (Transforming the global food supply).

Naturally this is all ties into lands being destroyed, climate change and trying to move people back into smart cities (Page 5). Surprise, surprise.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tkxe97pg2h791.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98132325423dfe0a466fa666b1edd95f9cb1bd67

So according to the report “What is the solution”. They say they want to move from **a focus on maximizing shareholder returns** to ...a more equitable system focused on fair returns and benefits to all stakeholders—**building more equitable prosperity throughout the supply chain (Page 7)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rig4owki2h791.jpg?width=1269&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0274a1e7b4abdef4366dc226b39d3ceeb41a1b6b

There’s that term “stakeholders” which Klaus Schwab loves to use, as in stakeholder capitalism. In other words they want total control of the supply chain whilst the WEF members get richer.

How are they going to take control of the supply chain ? One of the ways is through data collection (on peoples spending and eating habits) and getting all these huge global companies (actors) who are all WEF partners to work together (Page 8).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nnf5msxj2h791.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9262bf951d1238e439a442606bbc0f22663e2492

This will be achieved by **“Success will require numerous changes to policies, practices, and norms”** (Page 8). In other words laws will have to be changed.

It is also being sold to the general public as being good for our health and food as being medicine (Page 10). Once this system is implemented you won’t get fat and sick.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/64dj1jll2h791.jpg?width=608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c22942238fa1ab62a341460628f559b246d970e5

This is not surprising as you will be eating bugs like the World Economic Forum are planning.

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/why-we-need-to-give-insects-the-role-they-deserve-in-our-food-systems/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/why-we-need-to-give-insects-the-role-they-deserve-in-our-food-systems/)

The plan is to centralise and control the food supply into one body, one **single executive office**. Kind of has a ring to it of a “one world government”. It is interesting the reference made to 9/11. When 9/11 occurred it was for everyones safety that the Department of Homeland Security was set up. People were afraid. Problem, reaction, solution all over again and it would seem to be the same actors involved. (Page 14)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mxyo5jn2h791.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e3e44ae91e500c66049464bc8948859b339d6e7

This report is dressed up as being in the public interest yet it is anything but. For 2 years Covid was the focus of attention. It was Stage 1 of Agenda 2030.

The total and utter destruction of the food supply seems to now be well under way. This is all too evident especially when Fact Checkers are having to debunk the number of fires at food processing plants within the last year

[https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/unfounded-claims-about-frequency-and-causes-of-food-plant-fires/](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/unfounded-claims-about-frequency-and-causes-of-food-plant-fires/)

Added to this is the culling of herds of cattle in Kansas (as many as 10,000) which is being put down to high temperatures and drought. Farmers refute this and it looks far more sinister.

[https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave)

But this isn’t the first time herds have been culled in Kansas

In a fascinating article published on [allthatisinteresting.com](http://allthatisinteresting.com/)

“European settlers in the Great Plains are estimated to have reduced the American bison population from 30 million to just 325 by the 1880s. By the 1860s, bison had roamed the Great Plains for 10,000 years. They numbered in the tens of millions, charging across the flat landscape in such a cacophony that people called it the ""Thunder of the Plains."" For generations, they'd provided Native Americans with food, clothing, shelter, and even spiritual imagery.

&#x200B;

But everything began to change after the Civil War. The railroad was snaking west, bringing with it new towns, trains, telegram lines, and eager settlers. Determined to allow western expansion to continue, the U.S. government decided to clear the way of Native Americans.

To do this, they set their sights on the bison. Killing bison to force Native Americans off the Plains was never explicit U.S. government policy. However, the government endorsed it”

“**Who controls the food supply controls the people**; **who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.”**

37,"There have been dozens of posts about water fluoridation on this sub in the past on scattered topics about the subject, and I decided to compile all of the studies together into one reference sheet. Brace for impact.",884.0,97fgsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/97fgsu/there_have_been_dozens_of_posts_about_water/,187.0,1534308104.0,"#[Part II concerning skeletal effects of fluoridated drinking water can be found here](https://redd.it/98q5me)



Hey guys, so I have noticed in the past tons of posts about water fluoridation and I decided to do what I do best and compile all of the links and evidence together into one giant reference table. Enjoy! 



All assumptions aside, I am relying on strict, hard evidence and studies. **Disclaimer**: I am not an expert in this field, I am just an [average joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myPRqz04iPw) and I like to combine information quickly in a readable manner for everyone to see. Many studies are incomplete, and some have great margins of error, so please be note and weary of that. Lots of data in this come from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and mainly reference a [summary from this very lengthy report done by the academy](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2)^1 in 2006. They also come from both British, American, Australian, and International sources.  



#Water fluoridation 



It is a process done in mainly [western countries](http://www.frot.co.nz/wapf/wapf_images/map.2.green.950b.jpg), most especially in the United States **for the purposes of public health to combat tooth decay**, particularly in children. Water fluoridation is done to help create a ""modern standard"" for teeth, especially since [America is infamous for always having clean teeth](https://thedentalexpress.com/how-early-americans-took-care-of-their-teeth/).^2,3,4 



In fact, **America makes up the *vast* ~~majority~~ plurality of fluoridated citizens worldwide**, [according to the Center for Disease Control itself](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2014stats.htm). Out of the 435 million people worldwide drinking water actively fluoridated by government, more than 200 million of them are in the United States. 



###Here are some statistics on populations of the fluoridated citizenry as of 2014, according to the CDC link: 


Group | Diagnostic 
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:| 
| Total US population, persons                                                             | 318,857,056 | 
| US population on community water systems (CWS), persons                                 | 284,099,832 | 
| Total US population on fluoridated drinking water systems, persons                      | 211,393,167 | 
| Percentage of US population receiving fluoridated water                                 | 66.3%       | 
| Percentage of US population on CWS receiving fluoridated water                   | 74.4%       | 
| Number of CWS providing fluoridated water                                               | 18,186      | 
| Number of CWS adjusting fluoride                                                        | 5,919       | 
| Number of CWS consecutive to systems with optimal fluoride levels                       | 6,015       | 
| Number of CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above optimal levels            | 6,205       | 
| Population served by CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above optimal levels | 11,883,007  | 



###And that was just the national level. Let's take a look at it state by state:

It's not a surprise that the CDC actually [prides itself](http://archive.is/ZQXW) in water fluoridation, saying that it is one of the ten greatest public health achievements in United States History. 



###Now back to the rest of the world 


Dental hygiene and cavities remain a [public health concern^5 for 60-90% of children^6 in industrialised countries^7, along with adults](http://www.who.int/oral_health/media/en/orh_cdoe_319to321.pdf)^8. Water fluoridation may be a solution to this, and [according to the United Kingdom, there are no adverse effects of this](https://www.york.ac.uk/media/crd/crdreport18.pdf)^9, but that has been [disputed over the years](http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v192/n9/full/4801410a.html)^10 by academia. The process by which public drinking water is fluorided has shown to cause [dental fluorosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis)^11. Australian government health councils have noticed this but [say that it is ""not a public health concern""](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/Eh41_Flouridation_PART_A.pdf).^12




However, there are some problems associated with the benefits and buffetings done by water fluoridation by government; in fact, evidence has shown in Europe^13 to have little influence over tooth quality in adults, but major differences in children. Many countries in Europe have experienced [substantial declines](https://www.wda.org/wp_super_faq/european-countries-have-rejected-fluoridation-so-why-should-we-fluoridate-water) in tooth decay^14 even without its use, even to the point where it may be unnecessary due to personal choices to keep up with dental hygiene. 



#Government standards and practices 



*For the purposes of this to let me add many links quickly, some of the links quoted here are not shown in the reference table (works cited) found below. Please refer to the reference table for citations in the footnotes above*.  



In 2011 the World Health Organization [suggested a level of fluoride from **0.5 to 1.5 mg/L**, tailored to climate, locality, and other sources of fluoride](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-153.1-157.147). To avoid repetition in referencing, please refer to [this gigantic document released by the World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf) concerning international standards for the practice of water fluoridation. It took a very long time for me to read. 



As of 2012, [25 countries have actively participated in water fluoridation, 11 of them have more than half of the population drinking water](http://bfsweb.org/onemillion/onemillion.htm) with *dangerous* amounts of fluorine^15, the health effects I will list below. 



In the United States, [the CDC has also provided a national table guideline for how fluoride should be placed in the water](http://archive.is/lvKz). It is *yet again* an extremely lengthy document, so brace yourself and grab some coffee (hopefully without sodium fluorine). 


Included in that bible-sized document are some very important [tables](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039178.htm#00001289.htm): 



TABLE 2.  Recommended optimal fluoride levels for community public water supply systems: 





Annual average of maximum daily air temperatures | Recommended fluoride | Recommended control range (mg/L) 0.1-0.5
:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------
F | C | (mg/L) | Below | Above 
 50.0-53.7  | 10.0-12.0 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 1.7  
 53.8-58.3  | 12.1-14.6 | 1.1 | 1.0 | 1.6  
 58.4-63.8  | 14.7-17.7 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 1.5  
 63.9-70.6  | 17.8-21.4 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 1.4  
 70.7-79.2  | 21.5-26.2 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 1.3 
 79.3-90.5  | 26.3-32.5 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 1.2  




###Here are some of the chemicals frequently added to 63% of the US population's drinking water according to the CDC: 




* Sodium Fluoride. (NaF), the US Government administers 1/5th of a lethal dose per liter of water. 



* Fluorosilicic acid. (H2SiF6), which is expensive to transport. This one is most frequently used by the United States. **It is also a byproduct of fertilizer**. 



* Sodium fluorosilicate. (Na2SiF6), it is easier to ship. 




[References, there are five of them that each contain lengthy files concerning the content and how it is administered](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-5491.0-5699.36). The references are tedious to repeat, but nevertheless, **I have them below in the works cited table as references 16-20**. 




Also I will admit that I found this (the following) [on Wikipedia](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-1019.0-1027.204) and it is rather concerning: 



> Although fluoride was once considered an essential nutrient, the U.S. National Research Council has since removed this designation due to the lack of studies showing it is essential for human growth, though still considering fluoride a ""beneficial element"" due to its positive impact on oral health. 



And perhaps the scariest find of them all, [from the CDC again](http://archive.is/Eu1A), saying that: 



> .....optimal level of fluoride to range from **0.7 to 1.2 mg/L**..... 



Okay, now on to some more stuff. 




###Safety concerns and hazards 



There have been many cases of fluoride accidents resulting in illness and death in state populations in the past, particularly in the 1990's. Such cases can cause severe vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. One such case was in 1992 in Alaska, where 262 people became ill and one person passed away. Another incident in 2010 in [Asheboro, North Carolina, where 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water in 90 minutes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100704054308/http://www.myfox8.com/news/wghp-asheboro-fluoride-release-100629,0,2164002.story). 




#Health effects and experimentation 


Experimentation with both low and high concentrations of fluoride in water among native and eastern societies shows that **fluoride in drinking water has a significantly high impact on IQ**. 



I will mainly be referencing [this study](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2), done by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Also, remember and recall the [World Health Organisation's standards regarding fluoride levels](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf) and implementation; keep that in mind as you read my remarks on the study. [For those of you who have trouble loading PDF's, here is an archived link to an html of the same document](http://archive.is/PcaXR). Since the study is very lengthy containing several chapters, I mainly reference the summary but also some elements of chapters 1, 2, and 7. The study contains more chapters, especially very concerning ones about fluoride drinking water's effects on the endocrine system in chapter 8, but I may save that for another time. 



The reasoning behind the study was actually because of the EPA: 



> In response to EPA’s request, the NRC convened the Committee on Fluoride in Drinking Water, which prepared this report. The committee was charged to review toxicologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data on fluoride— particularly data published since the NRC’s previous (1993) report—and exposure data on orally ingested fluoride from drinking water and other sources. 




Furthermore, this is the scary part, particularly recalling earlier in this post when I referenced the safety levels of fluoride: 



> Overall, the committee found that the contribution to total fluoride exposure from fluoride in drinking water in the average person, depending on age, is 57% to 90% at 2 mg/L and 72% to 94% at **4 mg/L**.



So clearly for above-average water drinkers like me, I'm getting a very large dose of this stuff. 



Musculoskeletal concerns: 




> There were few studies to assess fracture risk in populations exposed to fluoride at 2 mg/L in drinking water. The best available study, from Finland, suggested an increased rate of hip fracture in populations exposed to fluoride at concentrations above 1.5 mg/L. 




Keep in mind that those bone fractures only occurred at 1.5 or 2 mg/L, when above average people like me get 4 mg/L. 




Skeletal fluorosis: 



> Skeletal fluorosis is a bone and joint condition associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of fluoride. Fluoride increases bone density and appears to exacerbate the growth of osteophytes present in the bone and joints, resulting in joint stiffness and pain. The condition is categorized into one of four stages: a preclinical stage and three clinical stages that increase in severity. The most severe stage (clinical stage III) historically has been referred to as the “crippling” stage. At stage II, mobility is not significantly affected, but it is characterized by chronic joint pain, arthritic symptoms, slight calcification of ligaments, and osteosclerosis of the cancellous bones. Whether EPA’s MCLG of 4 mg/L protects against these precursors to more serious mobility problems is unclear.




Gastrointestinal and other organ systems: 



> The committee also considered effects on the gastrointestinal system, kidneys, liver, and immune system. There were no human studies on drinking water containing fluoride at 4 mg/L in which gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or immune effects were carefully documented. Case reports and in vitro and animal studies indicated that exposure to fluoride at concentrations greater than 4 mg/L can be irritating to the gastrointestinal system, affect renal tissues and function, and alter hepatic and immunologic parameters. Such effects are unlikely to be a risk for the average individual exposed to fluoride at 4 mg/L in drinking water. However, a potentially susceptible subpopulation comprises individuals with renal impairments who retain more fluoride than healthy people do.  



###And finally, chapter 7 of the entire study [concludes effects on neurological and IQ systems](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/9): 



A lengthy description of the experiment and study: 



> Several studies from China have reported the effects of fluoride in drinking water on cognitive capacities (X. Li et al. 1995; Zhao et al. 1996; Lu et al. 2000; Xiang et al. 2003a,b). Among the studies, the one by Xiang et al. (2003a) had the strongest design. This study compared the intelligence of 512 children (ages 8-13) living in two villages with different fluoride concentrations in the water. The IQ test was administered in a double-blind manner. The high-fluoride area (Wamiao) had a mean water concentration of 2.47 ± 0.79 mg/L (range 0.57-4.50 milligrams per liter [mg/L]), and the low-fluoride area (Xinhuai) had a mean water concentration of 0.36 ± 0.15 mg/L (range 0.18-0.76 mg/L). The populations studied had comparable iodine and creatinine concentrations, family incomes, family educational levels, and other factors. The populations were not exposed to other significant sources of fluoride, such as smoke from coal fires, industrial pollution, or consumption of brick tea. Thus, the difference in fluoride exposure was attributed to the amount in the drinking water. Mean urinary fluoride1 concentrations were found to be 3.47 ± 1.95 mg/L in Wamiao and 1.11 ± 0.39 mg/L in Xinhuai. Using the combined Raven’s Test for Rural China, the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of the children in Wamiao was found to be significantly lower (92.2 ± 13.00; range, 54-126) than that in Xinhuai (100.41 ± 13.21; range, 60-128). **The IQ scores in both males and females declined with increasing fluoride exposure**. .....A study conducted by Lu et al. (2000) in a different area of China also compared the IQs of 118 children (ages 10-12) living in two areas with different fluoride concentrations in the water (3.15 ± 0.61 mg/L in one area and 0.37 ± 0.04 mg/L in the other). The children were lifelong residents of the villages and had similar social and educational levels. Urinary fluoride concentrations were measured at 4.99 ± 2.57 mg/L in the high-fluoride area and 1.43 ± 0.64 mg/L in the low-fluoride area. IQ measurements using the Chinese Combined Raven’s Test, Copyright 2 (see Wang and Qian 1989), showed significantly lower mean IQ scores among children in the high-fluoride area (92.27 ± 20.45) than in children in the low-fluoride area (103.05 ± 13.86). Of special importance, 21.6% of the children in the high-fluoride village scored 70 or below on the IQ scale. For the children in the low-fluoride village, only 3.4% had such low scores. Urinary fluoride concentrations were inversely correlated with mental performance in the IQ test. Qin and Cui (1990) observed similar negative correlation between IQ and fluoride intake through drinking water.



[Here is Figure 7-1, showing females](https://www.nap.edu/openbook/030910128X/xhtml/images/p200111b7g207001.jpg); and [here is Figure 7-2 showing males](https://www.nap.edu/openbook/030910128X/xhtml/images/p200111b7g207002.jpg). 



Furthermore, referencing another study inside of this one: 



> Spittle (1994) reviewed surveys and case reports of individuals exposed occupationally or therapeutically to fluoride and **concluded there was suggestive evidence that fluoride could be associated with cerebral impairment**. A synopsis of 12 case reports of fluoride-exposed **people of all ages showed common sequelae of lethargy, weakness, and impaired ability to concentrate regardless of the route of exposure**. In half the cases, memory problems were also reported. Spittle (1994) described several of the biochemical changes in enzymatic systems that could account for some of the psychological changes found in patients. He suggested that behavioral alterations found after excessive exposure could be due to the disruption of the N-H bonds in amines, and subsequently in proteins, by the production of N-F bonds (Emsley et al. 1981). This unnatural bond would distort the structure of a number of proteins with the collective potential to cause important biological effects. Fluorides also distort the structure of cytochrome-c peroxidase (Edwards et al. 1984). Spittle also noted the likelihood of fluoride interfering with the basic cellular energy sources used by the brain through the formation of aluminum fluorides (Jope 1988) and subsequent effects on G proteins.



Even furthermore, on the topic of silcofluorides which may even contain lead: 



> Another issue that has been raised about differential effects of silicofluorides comes from the dissertation of Westendorf (1975). In that study, silicofluorides were found to have greater power to inhibit the synthesis of cholinesterases, including acetylcholinesterase, than sodium fluoride (NaF). For example, under physiological conditions, one molar equivalent of silicofluoride is more potent in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase than six molar equivalents of NaF (Knappwost and Westendorf 1974). This could produce a situation in which acetylcholine (ACh) accumulates in the vicinity of ACh terminals and leads to excessive activation of cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. At high concentrations, agents with this capability are frequently used in insecticides and nerve gases. At intermediate concentrations, choking sensations and blurred vision are often encountered. Modifications of the effectiveness of the acetylcholinergic systems of the nervous system could account for the fact that, even though native intelligence per se may not be altered by chronic ingestion of **water with fluoride ranging from 1.2 to 3 mg/L, reaction times and visuospatial abilities can be impaired**. These changes would act to reduce the tested IQ scores. Such noncognitive impairments in children were reported in a meeting abstract (Calderon et al. 2000), but a full publication has not been issued. Extended reaction times have been associated with impaired function of the prefrontal lobes, a behavioral change not directly tied to alterations in IQ (Winterer and Goldman 2003). Because almost all IQ tests are “time-restricted,” slow reaction times would impair measured performance.




It can also be linked to Dementia due to the way that fluorides react with certain minerals in the body which produces a severe impact on cerebral metabolism: 



> For more than 30 years it has been known that Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a substantial decline in cerebral metabolism (Sokoloff 1966). This original observation has been replicated many times since then. The decrease is reflected in the brain’s metabolic rate for glucose, cerebral rate for oxygen, and cerebral blood flow. In terms of reduced cerebral blood flow, the reduction found in Alzheimer’s patients is about three times greater than in patients with multi-infarct dementia. **As early as 1983, Foster et al. (1983) demonstrated a general decline in the rate of utilization of glucose with the marker F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose with a positron-emission tomography scan. Recently, over and above the general decline in aerobic metabolism, several patterns of enhanced decreases in energy utilization have been demonstrated**. The temporal, parietal, and frontal regions are areas with some of the greatest reductions (Weiner et al. 1993; Starkstein et al. 1995). It is possible that the decline in glucose utilization is an early sign of the onset of dementia (Johnson et al. 1988; Silverman and Small 2002). In addition there is evidence from a number of sources that alterations induced by Alzheimer’s disease can be observed in many body regions and in blood. This indicates that the disease has *system-wide* effects in the body. One system particularly sensitive to carbohydrate utilization is the collection of areas involved with the synthesis of **ACh**. The release of this transmitter is also negatively affected by the interruption of aerobic metabolism and the effect can be noticed in the projection fields of the cholinergic systems. **Fluoride produces additional effects on the ACh systems of the brain by its interference with acetylcholinesterase**.



Furthermore, concerning aluminum and how it reacts with fluoride that may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's: 



> ....Because of the great affinity between fluorine and aluminum, it is possible that the greatest impairments of structure and function come about through the actions of charged and uncharged AlF complexes (AlFx). In the late 1970s and through the early 1990s there was considerable interest in the possibility that elemental aluminum was a major contributing factor to the development of dementia of the Alzheimer’s variety as well as to other neurological disorders. In a study of more than 3,500 French men and women above the age of 65 (Jacqmin et al. 1994), *a significant decrease in cognitive abilities* was found when their drinking water contained calcium, aluminum, and *fluorine*. 



Neurochemical effects of fluoride in drinking water in animals that may be similar to humans: 



> Fluoride has been shown to decrease the activities of superoxide dismutase (Guan et al. 1989) and glutathione peroxidase (Rice-Evans and Hoschstein 1981), the consequences being increased free radicals.




> ....NaF injected subcutaneously into rabbits altered brain lipid metabolism (Shashi 1992b) and concentrations of protein, free amino acid, and RNA in the brain (Shashi et al. 1994).



###Further findings by the study: 



> In assessing the potential health effects of fluoride at 2-4 mg/L, the committee found three studies of human populations exposed at those concentrations in drinking water that were useful for informing its assessment of potential neurologic effects. These studies were conducted in different areas of China, where fluoride concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 4 mg/L. Comparisons were made between the IQs of children from those populations with children exposed to lower concentration of fluoride ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg/L. The studies reported that while modal IQ scores were unchanged, the average IQ scores were lower in the more highly exposed children. This was due to fewer children in the high IQ range. While the studies lacked sufficient detail for the committee to fully assess their quality and their relevance to U.S. populations, **the consistency of the collective results warrant additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence**. Investigation of other mental and physiological alterations reported in the case study literature, including mental confusion and lethargy, should also be investigated.



> ....On the basis of information largely derived from histological, chemical, and molecular studies, **it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain** and the body by direct and indirect means. 



There you go, the National Academy is recommending the EPA to do something about this. Too bad that the EPA doesn't have power to control it, only to regulate the content. The CDC controls the substances and administers them to the drinking water. 



Please take note of all methods of proof, verification, and sources and make note of many disclaimers associated with the use of these studies, along with the disclaimers inside of the studies concerning the material. 



Have a wonderful day.

(note - much of this info is known.. I will try to differentiate key things I feel I discovered here that I believe no one else has discovered. The stuff that isn't known are things I feel I have discovered are legit because of pieces I have put together or just because I understand key details because I have studied this so long and see so many connections showing they are legit. ALL of these things I will be discussing here are related in weird ways... I discovered this after years of research and seeing these connections)

&#x200B;

1 - Cold Fusion discovered by Pons and Fleschmann WAS legit - in a way - But they did NOT understand what they really discovered. Which is why they were discredited by the people in power.

What they actually stumbled onto is actually called MUON CATALYZED fusion. Which is USED - along with other power sources - to power antigravity craft - Electrogravitic craft.

The Muon Catalyzed fusion process creates energy from ANTIMATTER reactions. Bob Lazar even describes the alien power plant as an antimatter reactor but claims you need an element that can't be recreated with our tech - he mixes truth with lies here.

&#x200B;

2. Bob Lazar is a government disinformation agent who is using the alien cover story to hide the fact the US government learned and developed how to master antigravity technology from and with Nazi scientists - actually called electrogravitics. The craft Lazar described IS real.. but it is either designed by the US gov OR they got the design from Nazis after WWII. A family member of mine WITNESSED this craft in the late 60s near the Canadian border. My family member witnessed the craft at point blank range. 20 feet above the highway they were on. Watched it for several minutes.

This same craft was also shown by Billy Meier around the same time (1960s)... along with designs that appeared to be disinformation.

**Bob Lazar came forward at the exact same time Pons and Fleischmann went public to announce cold fusion. THIS was the purpose of the disinfo campaign. It was a distraction and disinformation.**

&#x200B;

3. 2 scientists who wrote a paper stating that the discovery Pons and Fleischmann discovered was actually an anti matter reaction. One of these scientists died suddenly not long after this and another was murdered under weird circumstances at a later date.

&#x200B;

4. IF you fire a particle accelerator at gold it will produce antimatter - this is key to the process. In the Pons and Fleischmann discovery it was cosmic rays triggering this effect but they did not know  this.

&#x200B;

5. Viktor Schauberger - an Austrian self taught scientist is the father of the German antigravity craft and its power system! Read the Hunt for Zero Point by Nick Cook to learn more about this. But mis or dis info is included in this book so you have to sort through it.  I believe that Zero point energy IS a red herring to take people off the trail of the truth.

Read Hunt for Zero Point by Nick Cook here free -  [http://plain2.tripod.com/huntforzeropoint.pdf](http://plain2.tripod.com/huntforzeropoint.pdf)

6. The Great Giza Pyramid in Egypt was not a tomb.. it was not built by aliens.. it was built by an advanced human civilization that was wiped out and survivors likely stayed in Egypt and tried to preserve this info but no one could decode it for thousands of years. The elite may STILL be decoding this info.

7. The great Giza pyramid was a nuclear powered PARTICLE ACCELERATOR used to try to reverse climate change - global warming - that was part of the destruction of that past advanced civilization.

The Giza site was used to PROCESS nuclear material. The colors of each pyramid are the colors that comprise uranium ore. The small pyramid was half black half green, the second pyramid was orange/red, the third was white - the color of processed uranium.

In alchemy/theoccult black, red and white are the colors of transmutation. The nuclear process is the process of transmutation. Was the philosopher's stone uranium?

8. To understand how the pyramid reversed climate change study Henrik Svensmarks work and a documentary called Cloud Mystery, Cosmic rays create clouds in our atmosphere.. the pyramids purpose was to try to produce clouds to reverse global warming - the end of the ice age they lived in.

9. To understand part of how the great pyramid worked research Christopher Dunn's work- Giza Powerplant. But he did not understand everything therefore he couldn't understand the true purpose. He did see part of the purpose though.

The great pyramid was an immense electrical capacitor... Dunn did not understand this. Capacitors are key to particle accelerators... AND antigravity... this is how I made the connection between antigravity and the great pyramid. There is more to this but to understand it you need to know how the pyramid worked.

10. The World Trade Center complex was destroyed using technology related to antigravity tech. Dr. Judy Wood has a lot of info correct relating to this.

11.  Thorium plasma batteries were attempted to be developed around 2010 or so - independently by 2 different people - one died suddenly of a heart attack one disappeared. This technology was also used to power antigravity saucers - the Nazi Bell. Nazi Germany had immense stockpiles of Thorium - people didn't know why at the time - this is why. This is just one way to power these craft though.

12. The McCandlish ARV - alien reproduction seems to be legit but that it was alien is disinformation.

13. SOME Nazis likely took antigravity tech to South America and Antarctica. There was a report from Admiral Byrd who took a US navy fleet to antarctica and reported seeing craft that could travel from pole to pole at great speed.

14. Research Westall 66 - a documentary about how many school children witnessed antigravity drones. This was right around the same time my family member witnessed the craft he saw. These craft that were seen in Australia may have come from Antarctica. It could have been Russians who may have developed this tech or even US tech.

15. Someone wrote a book how the Russians used saucer tech and were spying on and crashed in the Roswell incident.. this may have been misinfo or disinfo. It was likely the Nazis or some other country with Nazi tech. I also suspect that the incident in the 50s where saucers were reported to fly over the white house were also Nazi saucers... The Nazis may have actually put a base on the moon.. around this time.. if this is possible even with antigravity tech.

16. A device called the Repulsine created by Viktor Schauberger was the beginning of antigravity technology. It creates MANY amazing effects internally in an incredibly simple and elegant way... think of all the powers of nature packed in a tiny package.. a tempest in a teapot essentially. It also produced incredible amounts of energy and worked incredibly efficiently. Schauberger did not understand the process going on internally but the Nazis decoded this and developed tech based on it.

17. Both Viktor Schauberger AND Thomas Townsend Brown discovered electrogravitics at the same time completely independently. They both work using the same processes. But Schaubergers tech actually worked very well where as TT Brown's was at a very primitive stage and was less clear to work. Schaubergers was very tempermental and would only work under specific conditions - until the Nazis decoded it. The Nazis may have even used TTBrowns patent to help them decode Shaubergers  device.

18. This is incredibly important to how the pyramid operated -  [http://sentinelkennels.com/Research\_Article\_V41.html](http://sentinelkennels.com/Research_Article_V41.html)

Christopher Dunn talked about tombs that were supposedly used to put bulls in. These were not bull tombs. They were storage containers for some nuclear material. This is why they were machined so perfectly.

19. The elite put the truth in plain sight...

Pyramids around the Giza plateau were used to store spent nuclear material in ancient history

20. With the info I am providing here.. if people go through all this info I am providing and understand it I know that people could work together and figure out how Schauberger's device worked. The key to understanding it is to realize it was many things in one... an electrostatic generator... a capacitor... a particle accelerator... This little device used natural processes to produce antimatter.. Proof of how this is possible -

[https://www.nasa.gov/mission\_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html)

21. The key to understanding the Pons and Fleischmann situation is to understand why their experiment wasn't reproducible.. 1 they didn't understand the actual effect that was occurring 2 The effect worked because of where they were...  they were In Utah at high altitude. Cosmic rays are more intense at high altitude. Because it was a cosmic ray reaction rather than a cold fusion reaction.. for the experiment to be reproducible anyone testing it would need to be at high altitude.

22. Bob Lazar came forward at the exact same time Pons and Fleischmann went public to announce cold fusion. THIS was the purpose of the disinfo campaign. It was a distraction and disinformation.

It had multiple purposes that are difficult to explain.. but if others witnessed the craft my dad did.. and if they realized that a power source like cold fusion existed... they could figure out how the saucer worked and develop both technologies.This is why it was imperative to discredit P&F AND to make people think the saucer they might have seen was alien not the US governments. I am also sure that the US gov was using that craft for espionage too.. which was likely why they had Billy Meier also producing disinfo with pics of this craft too.

23. Weird proof that I am right about the Giza pyramid being a particle accelerator. People claim that this hieroglyph shows the Egyptians had light bulbs.. they likely did have light bulbs but that is not what this is showing...  THIS is called a Crookes tube today - this is the basic idea behind a particle accelerator...

24. The word pyramid means - fire in the middle. The King's chamber of the great pyramid was where the ""sarcophagus"" was located... it was not a sarcophagus... this is where the uranium was placed... water entered into the King's chamber through small pipe like structures cut into the stone. The water went in one side and out the other to keep the nuclear material cool. And the steam in there created pressure... the materials the pyramid was made of would produce electricity when under pressure. The grand gallery of the great pyramid was designed like this -

The queen's chamber produced hydrogen that was accelerated in the grand gallery..

[https://www.gizapower.com/Articles/door.html](https://www.gizapower.com/Articles/door.html)

&#x200B;

25. People studying the Great pyramid found carbon 14 in one of the vents of the King's chamber... carbon is used to regulate nuclear reactions - which was the purpose of the King's chamber. When cosmic rays hit carbon it produces carbon 14. This shows the purpose of the great pyramid.

26. One of the things that led me to the Great pyramid when i was researching antigravity I was researching someone named Viktor Grebenekov - he is disinformation to lead people away from Schauberger... but remember - Disinformation often includes real information to confuse us even more. There is a connection between insects and antigravity... BEES work as electrostatic generators... they produce an electrical charge. They have a material called chitin that is dielectric. Dielectrics are used in capacitors. I was doing a search and found a video about the great pyramid by Christopher Dunn that talked about chitin in the great pyramid. I found that there was a part of the great pyramid that had many insect shells in it - above the King's chamber. They were used as a seal - a dielectric seal because there was a crack there... You have to research all these things I am saying to understand all this.

27. People don't realize it but the pyramid and obelisks are electricity producers.. the are essentially lightning rods. When they were made the entire Giza plateau had much more water flowing all through there... and below the ground the site is an immense aquifer.. when water flows through an aquifer it produces an electrical charge. THIS is why the builders put the great pyramid there.. the water and the charge. The great pyramid took this natural charge.. and used nuclear material to produce even more charge... the whole area would have been highly electrically charged. THIS is why they had obelisks all over the site. The obelisks took the charge out of the ground and released it with lightning strikes...

&#x200B;

This is also why freemasons put obelisks in places of power like Washington DC... it's a symbolic meaning. Ancients worshipped the god Baal... ""*The word* '*obelisk*' *literally means* '*Baal's shaft' or Baal's organ* of reproduction' ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal\_with\_Thunderbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_with_Thunderbolt)

28. Steven E Jones was involved both in discrediting Pons and Fleischmann AND in a group that spread disinfo and tried to discredit Dr. Judy Wood related to 9-11. Steven E Jones specialized in studying Muon Catalyzed fusion... which just so happens to be what Pons and Fleischmann discovered but didn't realize it.

When Pons and Fleischmann discovered cold fusion, before they went public, they went to the Department of Energy. The department of energy must have told Steven E Jones because he suddenly came forward at the same time revealing his own discoveries related to cold fusion...THIS forced P&F to go public before they were ready which helped the people who wanted to discredit them...

29. Look at the heiroglyphs in Egypt...they have many with bees... AND Scarab or dung beetles.. Both use elecrtrostatic effects to fly.. these are no just symbols for the Egyptians.. they are trying to tell us about these discoveries.. preserve their knowledge.. They know it was the end of times.. I suspect bumble bees can fly because of this electrostatic effect.  and the pyramid used this electrostatic effect.

30. when cosmic rays pass through quartz is produces an electrical charge... quartz granite also produces an electrical charge when pressure is applied.. as does quartz in general. This is why the pyramid produced electrical charge because of the pressure generated inside from the nuclear material producing heat. Heat causes expansion - pressure - which produced electricity. Cosmic rays passing through the great pyramid and the quartz and chitin filled limestone ALSO produced electricity.. the entire giza plateau was like an immense energy collector from cosmic rays.

31. I was studying the Great pyramid and based on what I learned about dielectrics and the stone used to make the great pyramid and particle accelerators  and cosmic rays I though the great pyramid was charged by cosmic rays.. I was reading TTBrowns journal after this and HE came to the same conclusion by the materials found in the great pyramid.

The stone Ed leedskalnin used to make Coral Castle also has the same properties the great pyramid stone had - quartz limestone. Ed said he knew the secret the Egyptians used to make the great pyramid. He also used an electrical device to direct energy at the limestone... and people claimed they secretly witnessed him move stones around like they were giant balloons... I suspect this was how the pryramid builders built the great pyramid.. because the stones held charges because they were made of quartz and dielectric materials they had a repulsive effect.. People claimed Leedskalnin was a freemason as they said the same about Nikola Tesla and they came from the same area in Europe.

32. a)When Viktor Schuaberger ran his repulsine device - which produced and electrical charge - it was an electrostatic generator - the metal inside the machine corroded incredibly rapidly.. It seems to me there is a connection here between the effect here and the way the World Trade Center was destroyed  - look at Dr. Judy Wood's work as well as John Hutchison's work. He used the same kind of phenomenon and saw the same kind of effects in his experiments. Rapidly corroding metals.. the same happened at the WTC site. The reason for this is that the WTC buildings were designed like capacitors themselves... the repulsine worked like a capacitor too.. as did the the great pyramid.

b) In this documentary  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wtt2EUToo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wtt2EUToo)  Episode 3 Symbols of an Alien Sky: The Electric Comet (Full Documentary) - From the electric universe theory.. they say that the comet that NASA studied had weird effects that couldn't be explained..  as if it had some form of propulsion they didn't understand. I learned that comets are made of limestone.. they appear to be part of planets that have been knocked loose... and they have quartz in them too.. these are JUST like the stones used in the pyramids AND Coral Castle... cosmic rays and radiation produced by the sun are hitting these comets and producing an electrogravitic or electromagnetic effect... this is what generates the propulsive effect.

33. Viktor Schauberger and T.Townsend Brown both discovered antigravity at the same time completely independently and both were screwed over by the US government. Read about this in Brown's daughters book and on her website. Not sure if the website is still operating. Learn about how Schauberger was screwed over in the documentary Comprehend And Copy Nature.

34. Earlier I stated that you all should read the book The Hunt for Zero Point by Nick Cook because it is a great primer on all this info.. BUT I also stated that I feel convinced Zero Point energy is a red herring to take people away from the real technology... the person who pushes zero point energy the most I have seen and in that book is Hal PUTHOFF Interesting name.. sounds like PUT OFF...

Above I said in a documentary you can see how Schauberger was screwed over by the US government... he was screwed out of his own technology and then died right after. In that documentary.. guess who has Schauberger's most important antigravity device... Hal Puthoff... Hal Puthoff was also part of a ""secret"" program that is now totally public where they developed Remote Viewing... which they claim works.. yet it's not secret now and they teach people how to do it... And it just so happens that remote viewers say aliens are real and they are the ones in the flying saucers.. I am sure that's not disinformation though. In the documentary Billion Dollar Secret Nick Cook mentioned disinformation right before he meets a remote viewer for the first time...  I wonder if he didn't call the remote viewer a liar because he was afraid of getting sued?

35. How Viktor Schauberger's repulsine worked.  The repulsine was an electrostatic generator... you would spin it up with an electric motor and cold water running through it.. once it started running it would run indefinitely Schauberger said. It was was made of different metals like bronze, brass, nickel and silver and some have said gold dust was used as a catalyst. Catalysts are not consumed in reactions. The water and air moving through the device is what created electricity to jump start its operation. It operated like a mini electrical storm  and tornado. People who have seen tornadoes in the eye of them say they have lightning flashing inside them. When you create a vortex like a tornado and as the repulsine had inside it it creates all kinds of effects.. and as I showed in a link in an earlier note above electrical storms work like particle accelerators and create antimatter reactions. The only known natural source of antimatter reactions on Earth. When antimatter reactions happen 2 particles annihilate and produce heat... the repusline worked like a natural heat engine.  it would convert that heat into motion which would produce more electricity.

&#x200B;

36. The Twin Towers were designed and built for 9-11... they were designed to be destroyed using advanced technology. If you look how the towers were engineered and designed they were like hollow cages with a solid core.. and they had a metal cage all around the surface...

Did you know the twin towers were also built EXACTLY 3 times the height of the two larges Giza pyramids?

I also believe the 2 largest pyramids were designed to work like a tuning for... they were designed to resonate with each other.. which was part of the Great pyramids operation... I suspect the twin towers were designed to resonate with each other as well. Both the pyramids and towers also appear to be built like capacitors as well...  Someone claimed the Twin towers had also corroded massively before 9-11... they were built to corrode rapidly which also helped them be taken down more easily on 9-11...galvanic corrosion.. which is an electrical process.

&#x200B;

37. This is a great website I forgot to mention earlier - Nuclear Pyramid -  [http://www.nuclearpyramid.com/great\_pyramid.php](http://www.nuclearpyramid.com/great_pyramid.php)  These people were right about many things relating to the pyramids nuclear aspect... but they didn't know the true purpose of the great pyramid - a huge particle accelerator. They also weren't aware of how  the water pump worked into the design below the pyramid OR how it produced elemental hydrogen in the queen's chamber.

&#x200B;

I suspect that there was method to deal with this. There was a russian study done with pyramids and they found that pyramids had a lot of bizarre effects - like fruit staying fresh longer in the pyramid AND radioactive material being neutralized. I believe this is because of the electrical effects of pyramid structures.. as well as other unknown effects.

I believe the entire Giza site had this same effect because it was so electrically charged...

Also, I think that radioactive waste was stored in all the pyramids around the Giza site and this is why all the pyramids were considered by the locals to be tombs.. they entombed the deadly nuclear material until they were neutralized by the effects of the site.

Did you know that the rate of nuclear decay can also be affected by outside effects? I suspect advanced ancient civilizations knew this and it may be known by the elite now too - here the sun causes this effect... but I suspect this can be done in a much more dramatic way by artificial methods -

[https://news.stanford.edu/news/2010/august/sun-082310.html](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2010/august/sun-082310.html)

They talk about radioactive waste on this site as well -

[http://www.nuclearpyramid.com/great\_pyramid.php](http://www.nuclearpyramid.com/great_pyramid.php)

Also, in the notes above I mentioned how there was a connection between the pyramids and the twin towers with the Hutchison effect.. here it talks about the Hutchison effect being used

&#x200B;

*Analysis*

&#x200B;

*In fact, the subtle variations in atomic decay data are not an effect of neutrinos, but the direct result of measurable surges of localized infrasound resonance, just as in the case of the 'aberrant' fluctuations of planetary gravity fields and the patterns observed in the variations in precipitation rates as measured using the long-term water flow rates of major rivers. The fundamental integrity of the measured radioactive isotopes is directly affected by the incident infrasound radiation.*

&#x200B;

*The decay rates measured by Jenkins at Purdue show a significant fluctuation specifically because of the location of his laboratory in relation to the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana (40.43°N 86.91°W) is 6,176 miles from Giza, a distance comprising 24.8% of the Earth's mean circumference. Infrasound standing waves focused by the Great Pyramid into the central Indiana area not only alter decay rates in Purdue labs, but also levitate huge sandstone boulders into treetops in nearby Limon and Yellowwood Indiana State Parks at the 25.0% distance.*

Why this is so important -

Proof of antigravity tech

Proof of free energy tech and the info I provide here can show us how to develop it ourselves.

Proof of history that has been suppressed - the true purpose of the great pyramid -proof of Henrik Svensmark theory - proof advanced civilizations lived in the past. The elite have known this all along.

&#x200B;

Why I am releasing this info now and why have I waited so long to reveal this info -

I have tried to talk about this info before and very strange things have happened. It's also so difficult to explain and takes so long to prove that I did not know the best way to do it. I worry that now I may have lost this chance by posting this info now in this way.. but I may not get this chance again if things do actually go to hell.

How I discovered this -

As I said above a family member witnessed a true flying saucer... told me his experience and info he conveyed to me helped me to put these pieces together.

I am just a nobody.. but i do have weird unique abilities... I have aspergers syndrome for one which helps me in a lot of ways to put this info together but also hurts me in trying to convey it to anyone else.

I will try to edit this page to add more info and to explain things better.

Please ask questions and I will do my best to answer them. Please help me in any way you can to spread this info as quickly as possible BEFORE the people in power bury this with misinfo and disinfo....

And for the people who go through my post history and don't believe me because I seem like an idiot.. yes in a lot of ways I am an idiot.. lol I am just an average Joe in most ways and someone who has aspergers syndrome too.. Pattern recognition is the ONLY thing I have ever been really good at.

I can explain myself more too later.

Explaining myself here.. I wanted to be a scientist when I was young.. I was good at learning but terrible at school. Terrible at adapting to the system. I was so bad at math that I had to give up on science. I wanted to be an inventor (and artist) though. My biggest hero was Leonardo da Vinci when I was a kid.

I have always had a lot of ideas about aircraft and flight an just tons of ideas about everything. I am super creative in my own way. I think this was a big key to making the discoveries here I did. I have an insatiable curiosity about things and constant ideas.

I am sure this will sound crazy but I feel that everything I learned in my life about science and technology helped me put all these pieces together. I had some testing done recently because I self diagnosed with aspergers later in life and had that verified recently, But when tested I tested super high in pattern recognition.. and this was after I made all these discoveries. It verified in some way what I already knew.  I know this will sound crazy too but I feel like this was my purpose in life.. nothing else in my life ever worked. And too many things have verified what I discovered...

This was really my life's dream... this was the kind of thing I always dreamed of learning.. but I never would have imagined anything as crazy as this.. I just wonder if I am the only one who is supposed to know this.. it would be sad to never be able to convey what I discovered to anyone because no one can believe it or understand it. I feel like the world isn't ready for this yet.

&#x200B;

I worked a long time to try to figure out a way to convey all this info in a way that people could understand and would be compelled to look into.. part of the problem with this info is that they think they already know it. This is by design.. this is the purpose of disinformation. Flood people with so much info they don't bother to look.. they don't know who or what to trust. I think knowing what my dad witnessed it gave me something to help weed through the BS.

But I am not a writer.. and I don't even know if the greatest writer could have figured out how to PROVE all this to anyone in a brief way.. What I have figured out through all this is it's not WHAT you have to say.. but it's how you say it. Which means that anyone can convince anyone of anything if they are well known or a great BSer... this is why it's so easy to manipulate people.. to lead them off the real path. Finally I got to the point I couldn't put any more energy into this.. I had to take care of life issues. So I have been sitting on this info hoping something would come to me about how to convey it. And here I am now.. I am hoping that with all eyes here on the conspiracy sub right now it might help get eyes on this. Plus I am just desperate..",conspiracy,climate change

The ancient Egyptians had [their pyramids](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm), the Greeks, their sculptures and temples. And everybody knows about the Maya and [their famous calendar](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_tzolkin_maya.htm). But other ancient peoples get short shrift in world history.

Here are a handful of long-lost cultures that don't get the name recognition they deserve.  


 

## 1 - The Silla

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m2dl2h5gspf41.jpg?width=374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=559c2252da59b4fc8e8cd5488c385b7d39a12665

 

The Silla Kingdom was one of the longest-standing royal dynasties ever. It ruled most of the Korean Peninsula between 57 B.C. and A.D. 935, but left few burials behind for archaeologists to study.

One recent Silla discovery gave researchers a little insight, however.

The intact bones of a woman who lived to be in her late 30s was found in 2013 near the historic capital of the Silla (Gyeongju). An analysis of the woman's bones revealed that she was likely a [vegetarian who ate a diet heavy in rice, potatoes or wheat](http://www.livescience.com/55137-ancient-woman-with-long-head-korea.html). She also had an elongated skull.

Silla was founded by the monarch **Bak Hyeokgeose**.

Legend held that he was hatched from a mysterious egg in the forest and married a queen born from *the ribs of a dragon*. Over time, the Silla culture developed into a centralized, hierarchical society with a wealthy aristocratic class.

Though human remains from the Silla people are rare, archaeologists have unearthed a variety of luxurious goods made by this culture, from a gold-and-garnet dagger to a cast-iron Buddha to jade jewelry, among other examples held at the Gyeongju National Museum in South Korea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

## 2 - The Indus

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fekznpirspf41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=697d70d029dea3571fe54f03b83eed43146a5eec

 

he Indus is the largest-known ancient urban culture, with the people's land stretching from the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan to the Arabian Sea and the Ganges in India.

The Indus civilization persisted for thousands of years, emerging around 3300 B.C. and declining by about 1600 B.C.

The Indus, also known as [the Harappans](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/esp_cienciaindia_3.htm), developed sewage and drainage systems for their cities, built impressive walls and granaries, and produced artifacts like pottery and glazed beads.

They even had dental care: Scientists [found 11 drilled molars](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/abs/440755a.html) from adults who lived between 7,500 to 9,000 years ago in the Indus Valley, according to a study published in 2006 in the journal Nature.

A 2012 study suggested that climatic change weakened monsoonal rains and dried up much of the Harappan territory, forcing the civilization to [gradually disband and migrate to wetter climes](http://www.livescience.com/20614-collapse-mythical-river-civilization.html). 

&#x200B;

 

## 3 - The Sanxingdui

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jo3srrduspf41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60462b7bb3031f7195390d2aa2f4feacefdbb82c

 

The Sanxingdui were a Bronze Age culture that thrived in what is now China's Sichuan Province.

A farmer first discovered artifacts from the Sanxingdui in 1929; excavations in the area in 1986 revealed complex jade carvings and bronze sculptures 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall.

But who were the Sanxingdui?

Despite the evidence of the culture's artistic abilities, no one really knows. They were prolific makers of painted [bronze-and-gold-foil masks](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/exhibit/the-faces-of-sanxingdui/gQwTb3I7?hl=en) that some archaeologists believe may have represented gods or ancestors, according to the Sanxingdui Museum in China.

The Sanxingdui site shows evidence of abandonment about 2,800 or 3,000 years ago, and another ancient city, Jinsha, discovered nearby, shows evidence that maybe the Sanxingdui moved there.

In 2014, researchers at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union argued that at around this time, a major earthquake and landslide [redirected the Minjiang River](http://www.livescience.com/49247-chinese-civilization-disappearance-explained.html), which would have cut Sanxingdui off from water and forced a relocation.

&#x200B;

 

## 4 - The Nok

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yegru5jwspf41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c38d4bc13f0b9fc5e42c2597f211c94f5a107f5

 

The mysterious and little-known Nok culture lasted from around 1000 B.C. to A.D. 300 in what is today northern Nigeria.

Evidence of the Nok was discovered by chance during a tin-mining operation in 1943, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Miners uncovered a terra-cotta head, hinting at a rich sculptural tradition.

Since then, other elaborate terra-cotta sculptures have emerged, including depictions of people wearing elaborate jewelry and carrying batons and flails - symbols of authority also seen in ancient Egyptian art, according to the [Minneapolis Institute of Art](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/5368/seated-dignitary-nok).

Other sculptures show people with diseases such as [elephantiasis](http://www.livescience.com/54744-elephantiasis-symptoms-cause.html), [the Met said](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nok/hd_nok.htm). Contributing to the mystery surrounding the Nok, the artifacts have often been removed from their context without archaeological analysis.

In 2012, the United States [returned a cache of Nok figurines](http://www.livescience.com/21891-nigeria-nok-statues-smuggled.html) to Nigeria after they were stolen from Nigeria's national museum and smuggled into the U.S.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

## 5 - The Etruscans

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6kqgs8yyspf41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a84bb0d5524dacb300a82c7e0d0fc7876dad4bcb

&#x200B;

 

The Etruscans had a thriving society in northern Italy from about 700 B.C. to about 500 B.C., when they began to be absorbed by the Roman Republic.

They developed a unique written language and left behind luxurious family tombs, including one belonging to a prince that was [first excavated in 2013](http://www.livescience.com/39984-estruscan-prince-skeleton-rome.html).

Etruscan society was a theocracy, and their artifacts suggest that religious ritual was a part of daily life. The oldest depiction of childbirth in Western art - a goddess squatting to give birth - was found at the Etruscan sanctuary of Poggio Colla.

At the same site, archaeologists found a 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2 by 0.6 meters) sandstone slab containing [rare engravings in the Etruscan](http://www.livescience.com/54262-religious-text-in-lost-etruscan-language.html) language. Few examples of written Etruscan survive.

Another Etruscan site, Poggio Civitate, was a square complex surrounding a courtyard.

It was the largest building in the Mediterranean at its time, said archaeologists who have [excavated more than 25,000 artifacts](http://opencontext.org/projects/DF043419-F23B-41DA-7E4D-EE52AF22F92F) from the site.

## 6 - The Land of Punt

Some cultures are known mostly through the records of other cultures.

That's the case with the mysterious land of Punt, a kingdom somewhere in Africa that traded with the [ancient Egyptians](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_egipto.htm). The two kingdoms were exchanging goods from at least the 26**th** century B.C., during the reign of the pharaoh Khufu.

Strangely, no one really knows where Punt was located. The Egyptians left plenty of descriptions of the goods they got from Punt (gold, ebony, myrrh) and the seafaring expeditions they sent to the lost kingdom.

However, the Egyptians are frustratingly mum on where all these voyages were headed.

Scholars have suggested that Punt may have been in Arabia, or on the Horn of Africa, or maybe down the Nile River at the border of modern-day South Sudan and Ethiopia.

You know a culture is obscure when archaeologists name it based on its artifacts alone.

The Bell-Beaker culture made pottery vessels shaped like upside-down bells. The makers of these distinctive drinking cups lived across Europe between about 2800 B.C. and 1800 B.C.

They also left behind copper artifacts and graves, including a [cemetery of 154 graves](http://www.muni.cz/research/projects/1863) located in the modern-day Czech Republic.

The Bell-Beakers were also responsible for some of the construction at Stonehenge, researchers have found: These people likely arranged the [site's small bluestones](http://www.livescience.com/25157-stonehenge-megaliths-timeline-enigma.html), which originated in Wales. ",conspiracy,climate change

Money, Power. Its Pretty Simple

Is climate change real, yes, the climate changes every day, every year, every century.

but for those who don't understand how things really work, let me show you. (and its not your fault, they intentionally lie to you and keep the truth from you-its easier to rule over you that way)

the sun has cycles of hot and cold-or colder, these cycles are 11 years long.

from [NASA.gov](https://NASA.gov) (normally a shit source of info but this is true\_

One way to track the solar cycle is by counting the number of sunspots. The beginning of a solar cycle is a **solar minimum**, or when the Sun has the least sunspots. Over time, solar activity—and the number of sunspots—increases.

The middle of the solar cycle is the **solar maximum**, or when the Sun has the most sunspots. As the cycle ends, it fades back to the solar minimum and then a new cycle begins.

if you take a picture of the sun, at the exact same time, from the exact same place every day, you get a figure 8, it is called the Analemma. 

https://preview.redd.it/l5fd1lhn5i191.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f697625152c6a8eb6d3826d221c2c33513f016

wikpedia-also a shit source, says this ( i have no idea if it is factually correct, but that is irrelevant to my point of showing you that it exists)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma)

and here are pictures of it from all over the world

[https://presearch.org/images?q=Analemma](https://presearch.org/images?q=Analemma)

one picture of interest is this one-while it is a picture of an art scuplture, its shows what is going on

so this artwork shows the suns analemma, its position thruout the year, as well as its position thruout the sun cycle-while not perfectly accurate, its good enough for a visualation.

now if we go back to the 1st pic in the post, we can see the sun is getting smaller, and yet it still has the top part of the analemma to complete, and if you look at photos, you will see the top portion of the ""8"" is generally longer and thinner.

the position that we are it in the 1st pic, of the smallest sun, with future suns to be even smaller is called the grand solar minimum.

this next chart show the sun cycles over the last 100 years.

https://i.redd.it/e6w7o4qs8i191.gif

as you can see, the sun is getting weaker since 1980

now some charts for a longer time frame, as you can see it is predicted we are going into a colder cycle, and in fact it is predicted that from 2095 to 3500-we will be going into an ice age. i will post the link to the website below the photo.

so as you can see, climate change is very real........

BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!!!

the north pole is drifting, actually it was drifting, now it seems to be sprinting, take a look

so add that to the other stuff, and the climate is definitely changing!

and if you look at history, when these things happened before, because the population was not prepared for it, people moved closer together to help each other out, it is at this time governments were formed, and people took control of the monetary systems.

it seems this is happeneing again.

if you actually, by yourself, go over all the numbers that say climate change is caused by humans, or carbon dioxide, they do not add up-literally. if you look at the list of all the scientist who say climate change is caused by humans-a large amount of the scientists-were not even college graduates (yet).

they want to take away you ability to make money, to prepare yourself, so you become relliant on the governments that they control.

I have been doing veterinary surgery in Panama and Ecuador and recently got back from a clinic in the Galapagos islands. My colleagues and I have been noticing some very worrying trends in nearly every central and south American veterinary clinic we have been working at. I'll try to quickly summarize our findings and then go into a little more detail.
There has been a massive increase in the percentage and type of zoonotic diseases being found in the animals.
Nearly 100% of the dogs we tested had antibodies for parvovirus and  parainfluenza virus. Over 2/3 had antibodies for adenovirus and about a 1/4 distemper. These were wild type antibodies in unvaccinated dogs and in many cases we were finding that the families that owned these dogs had contracted these viruses. Many people think that a lot of these viruses can only infect their pets but this is not true.
We also found over 25% of the dogs and cats infected with dirofilaria immitis, bartonella, and wolbachia pipiens. Bartonella was nearly 70% and almost every family member who lived with the infected animal had also contracted this. Over 2/3 of the cats had T. Gondi and toxoplasmosis was very prevalent in their human family members as well. A good % of the cats also had herpes virus.

One of the most disturbing trends was the % of animals we found testing positive for the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease. Even more disturbing is that we believe this is being spread by some other vector other than the kissing bug which is currently considered its only vector. Our current theories are that certain arthropods such as ticks, bed bugs, fleas, or certain hexapods are spreading this. This is particularly bad because it is being spread between humans as well and can be fatal if untreated. 

Currently the CDC says chagas disease can be trasmitted in these ways 
-contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug
-mother-to-baby (congenital),
-contaminated blood products (transfusions),
an organ transplanted from an infected donor,
-laboratory accident, or
contaminated food or drink (rare)

In our testing we have shown that T. Cruzi parasites can be transmitted between rodents through sex, unknown arthropods, and that food/drink contamination is certainly not rare. I can assure you that if it can be spread through sex between animals that it can be spread through human sex. If it can be spread from animal to animal through unknown arthropods, it can be spread to humans this way.

The crisis in Venezuela is going to make this much worse. Climate change is going to make this much worse. Globalization is making to this much worse when people all around the word are having south american crops in their stores I can assure you that these parasites/viruses/bacteria are going to become a big problem in Texas after the Harvey flood waters have spread everything around.


Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn't give two fucks about what country it is in and isn't magically prevented from crossing the border.
The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.",conspiracy,climate change

A while back I posted some information showing how unrelated events can tie back to a central theme, which is preparing of abrupt climate changes and the war that it will bring with it. This was predicated on the amount of literature appearing in National Security papers advocating changing operational changes to military preparedness all based on a paper suggesting that a little ice age will occur as a result of abrupt climate changes. 

And I went down the wrong rabbit hole. 

I'm not suggesting that we aren't heading into a new little ice age, because we are. But there's a problem, we aren't there yet, and when you look in the right direction, we should have been seeing bigger signs of this LIA occurring by now. 

Which leads to a certain possible scenarios. 

1) The Little Ice Age is off schedule. 
2) The LIA advocates are wrong.
3) Anthropogenic climate change is right, and we've thrown off or prevented the LIA. 
4) The LIA science is being manipulated into distracting those of us who actually do research  away from the real issue. 
5) A variable has come into play and the drastic measures being taken are in response to the variable. 

And what if I told you that scenario number five is our mambo number five that we should dance to? Because it is. And if you start verifying what I'm about to show you, you'll start to believe it too. 

The information is out there, and it's hidden in plain sight. 

Buckle up and strap in, because we are heading into a real life SHTF scenario. 

A while back in the middle of the lockdown I read something that caught my eye. It just seemed strange. Do you remember the reports about that [rotten smell in Paris](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.revyuh.com/top-news/trending/mysterious-smell-sulfur-invades-paris/&ved=2ahUKEwi2hfazkPXpAhXxg3IEHX4tBCc4ChAWMAJ6BAgHEAE&usg=AOvVaw3Ppgfx008McgFsKK79x81H) and [Britain?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thejournal.ie/bad-smell-france-england-765193-Jan2013/%3Famp%3D1&ved=2ahUKEwiPoOi_s_XpAhXBHc0KHR3-DL0QFjANegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw3n4x4CvXH7neTEEAulAEyV&ampcf=1)
Try as I could, I could barely find any information on the smell. And then much later on, while on a totally unrelated search, this [caught my attention](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thejournal.ie/bad-smell-france-england-765193-Jan2013/%3Famp%3D1&ved=2ahUKEwj7_ZzhkfXpAhVoT98KHU7aBJMQFjAFegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw3n4x4CvXH7neTEEAulAEyV&ampcf=1) Another report on the smell, but this one from January 22, 2013, from Paris to Britain, the exact same phenomenon from May 11th, 2020. And another simple explanation in the headline. 

Now I'm interested. My curiosity is caught and my need to examine is engaged. 

And I found nothing. Maybe it was just a couple of weird natural occurrences that made that rotten egg sulfur smell. The kind you smell when you have a really good go on the toilet. The kind of smell that's followed up with a ton of toilet paper (and if you really want to get insanely paranoid and believe TPTB are messing with us for their amusement, do you remember the world went insane for toilet paper? Things that make you go hmmmm) before you flush? That's the kind of smell that happened. 

And then later on again by accident, I found another headline, and I began to understand something, it's all hidden in plain sight. Seriously, they can't censor it or pretend it didn't happen, so they give a simple explanation and then bury it deep in search results. Even if you do hit upon the subject, it sounds so stupid that you don’t give it a second thought. 

But I'm dumb enough not to believe those who are smarter than me, and what I found recently altered my perspective on recent events. 

Because the more i became a pitbull and refused to let the smell go, the more the events kept happening. Everywhere. Literally, everywhere in almost every country and every city. Go ahead. Go to your search engine and try it. 

Search engine suggestions. 

1) Rotten smell complaints. 
2) Sulfur smell complaints.
3) Mystery smell. 
4) Mysterious odors.
5) Strange smell. 

Do you remember when I said the information is buried? It is. You will have to type in different variations, different places, anything you can think of, before results start popping up. But they might or might not pop up in the first ten results. If they do, guess what? It's usually in a place far away from you. 

Let me give you a couple big examples.

All of these reports follow the same pattern with either a simple explanation, or a, we don’t really know, so here's what might be happening. 

Now you can either believe that a smell is miraculously happening all over the planet at the same time is nothing more than a coincidence, or you can wake up and at bare minimum look into it yourself. Be warned though, you have to get very creative in your search criteria to keep getting results. 

So what, you might say? Shit smells bad, and I looked and this smell has always been there. Yes it has, it's natural, it's a part of our ecosystem. I'm not saying the smell is new, I'm saying the sulfur smell is growing, and if it keeps getting bad they aren't going to be able to keep it hidden for very much longer. 

How long until they can't keep it hidden if it keeps getting worse? I don’t know. I really don't. 

Why would they keep it hidden? 

Because it's toxic. It will kill you at certain parts per million in the air. Luckily it isn't that high yet, and maybe this stops, but it's a good thing that there's a pandemic happening that can be called outbreaks in case it does get worse. Isn't it? 

Do you have more information that you have linked to this sulfur smell?

Yes. Yes I do. And unfortunately, it's too much information. And all the obvious evidence is hidden in plain sight. 

Is there any scientists warning about this? 

NO! And that's the problem. It's a HUGE red flag. Why? Because it explains other events that have been happening world wide, events that scientists claim not to understand. They may not understand why it's happening, but they know what is happening. How do they know? Because it's happened before in our past. 

They call them extinction events. During the end Permian stage extinction event 

And wouldn't you know it, there is a ton of interest in that era from the science community right now.

Long story short, they really don't have any idea how the end Permian extinction event happened. But you'll notice that every theory they have is linked to something presently occurring. 

And guess what happened after nearly all marine life vanished and 70% of animals went e extinct? 

An ice age. 

Is this a precursor? A little extinction event (hopefully) before the little ice age kicks in? As I've said before, there seems to be a 2024-2025 date that's rather prominent in a lot of budgets, and technological timelines. Do they think they'll know enough by then? Or, is this when the real flattening of the population curve starts so humanity can have enough to survive? 

Listen, take this seriously. I will show you patterns as we go that indicate the worst of the sulfur effects are happening the seas and oceans, possibly making the middle northern landmass areas the safest (This is why it's mainly migratory birds and water life that are dying). I will also show you other geophysical evidence that this is occurring besides the rotten egg smell. 

And one last point, there maybe a pattern suggesting that the epidemic wasn't only orchestrated to cover up future events, but to possibly make any toxic environments worse right away. 

And if you're casually dismissive of this last point, do you remember those videos in China of people suddenly fainting? Do you remember that big cloud of sulfur dioxide that was recorded in the atmosphere above China? The one that was instantly called fake news and attributed to burning bodies (which it wasn't). 

Guess what else can make you suddenly faint when the concentrations are high enough? Hydrogen Sulfide? What if they really saw was actually Hydrogen Sulfide in the atmosphere? 

More to come. Hopefully I'm wrong.

Antarctica is very mysterious & there are lots of Conspiracy Theories about it.

While there are no VISA requirements or travel documents needed to go to Antarctica, good luck getting there. Once you're there, you'll definitely be tracked & monitored.

Due to [Global Warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) & [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), they stress the need to protect the ice & glaciers from melting rapidly due to increased human activity, so sea levels don't rise even more quickly than it already is.

# Antarctic Treaty

The [Antarctic Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System) is an unusual occurrence in the realm of international relations. It is a treaty that does not recognize any sovereign nation's claim on any part of the Antarctic territory as well as a treaty that states that the purpose of the Antarctic continent is dedicated to ""**peace & science**"".

# Operation Highjump

In 1947, [Admiral Richard E. Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd) led an expedition called “[Operation Highjump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Highjump)” to Antarctica. His 4th expedition to Antarctica. The expedition was supported by a large naval force ""**Task Force 68**"", commanded by [Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Cruzen). Task Force 68 included flagship USS Mount Olympus, aircraft carrier USS Philippine Sea, 13 US Navy support ships, 6 helicopters, 6 flying boats, 2 seaplane tenders, and 15 other aircraft. The total number of personnel involved was 4,700.

A Conspiracy Theory is that Byrd & his forces encountered heavy resistance to their Antarctic venture from “[flying saucers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer)” and had to call off the ""**invasion**"".

**Secretary of Defense** at the time, [James Vincent Forrestal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Forrestal) committed suicide. He allegedly jumped out of the window of the psychiatric ward in Maryland shortly after Operation Highjump. He was babbling about aliens in the days before he killed himself, or was allegedly murdered. Forrestal reportedly wanted to take a more truthful approach to informing the US pubic about this issue.

# Conspiracy Theories

Here are the Conspiracy Theories about Antarctica that I am aware of.

1. There's a **Nazi Base** with ""**advanced unconventional weapons**"" there, where allegedly [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) escaped to. [New Swabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia) was explored by Nazis in early 1939 & possibly led to discoveries of **aliens, demons**, entrance to [Inner Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Earth) & subsequent building of their Nazi Base. 2 submarines ([U-977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-977) & [U-530](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-530)) full of Nazis were stopped in Argentina after the war. Some people claimed that they were on their way to Antarctica. The [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) allegedly have roots in [Occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism_in_Nazism) ([Thule Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society)). Operation Highjump may be related to this.
2. There's an **Alien Base** with ""**advanced unconventional weapons**"" there. There may be more than 1 base. There may be more than 1 species of extraterrestrial. Operation Highjump may be related to this.
3. There's an entrance to [Inner Hollow Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Earth) in both the **south &** **north poles**. That is why no one is authorized to fly over the poles. Operation Highjump may be related to this.
4. There's ancient [Pyramids](https://www.google.ca/search?q=%E2%80%9CWe+are+all+in+danger.+It+is+evil+itself.%E2%80%9D&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuyomN9qLcAhUxHTQIHdVgA3cQ_AUICygC&biw=1536&bih=759#imgrc=2ieLY5-F284UDM:) & ""**flash frozen**"" **human bodies** there that need to be carefully excavated & preserved. There's a submerged & lost continent there with a [Pre-Adamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Adamite) **ancient civilization** or maybe even **Atlantis** for example.  There's a **Piri Reis** map that shows Antarctica **free of Ice** which contradicts the dating of the map. The flash freezing can be related to the last [Nibiru Cataclysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru_cataclysm) in #8, which is another Conspiracy Theory. The [Cataclysmic Pole Shift Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_shift_hypothesis) suggests that there have been geologically rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern-day geographic locations of the poles and the axis of rotation of the Earth, creating calamities such as floods and tectonic events.
5. There's ancient **Pyramids** & ""**flash frozen**"" **alien bodies & technology** there that need to be carefully excavated & preserved. This can be related to the **Annunaki** & **Nibiru** Conspiracy Theories.
6. There's an enormous ""**Wall of Ice**"" blocking us from ""**Other Lands**"" in a [Flat Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth) model. Operation Highjump may be related to this.
7. There's an enormous ""**Wall of Ice**"" holding up the ""[Dome Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament)**""** in a **Flat Earth** model. Operation Highjump may be related to this.
8. Due to highly elongated orbit of **Nibiru** (aka Planet X), it's approach can only be seen from the south pole of Antarctica. This is a potential **Extinction Level Event (ELE)** that needs to be suppressed, so **mass fear & anarchy** doesn't spread. This is also related to the ""[Return of the Annunaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki)"".
9. Hundreds of ""**fresh**"" **under ice lakes** were discovered that were isolated for millions of years. There are strange creatures there. For example, in [Lake Vostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vostok), Russian scientists discovered a **highly intelligent giant squid / octopus** they named, ""[Organism 46-B](http://cryptidz.wikia.com/wiki/Organism_46-B)"". They found out the hard way that this frightening creature could ""**shape change**"" & mimic the shape of divers. It could **paralyze** their prey from **150 ft away**. Supposedly they captured one & it is being secretly ""**weaponized**"". Scientists have also discovered ""[warm caves](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/researchers-find-secret-warm-oasis-beneath-antarcticas-ice-that-could-be-home-to-undiscovered-species)"" under Antarctica which could support secret life with some caves reaching 25 degrees Celsius.
10. Based on [Harry Wexler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Wexler) Theories, Tests, ""[Operation Fishbowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fishbowl)"" etc, they are manipulating Antarctica's Massive generation of Cold Air in conjunction with [HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program), [Chemtrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory) & other [Weather Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification) & [Geo Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering) methods to ""**weaponize**"" **the weather**. It is also speculated that Operation Fishbowl is connected to the Dome Firmament theory too.
11. The Russian Navy transported ""**Ark of Gabriel**"" to Antarctica. This enigmatic ancient relic ""**weapon**"" was discovered under the [Masjid al-Haram Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca) on Sep 12, 2015. 15 workers supposedly were killed by a ""**burst of energy**"" so powerful that it knocked over a construction crane above ground that killed an additional 107 people. On Sep 24, 2015 a 2nd attempt was made to unearth the Ark of Gabriel, which resulted in another massive ""**plasma emission**"" that killed an estimated 4,000 more people. Saudi officials blamed the catastrophe on a ""**stampede**"" ([2015 Mina Stampede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mina_stampede)) to cover it up. [Roman Catholic Pope & Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/pope-francis-russian-orthodox-patriarch-kirill-make-history-cuba-first-meeting-in-1000-years) met on Feb 12, 2016 for the first time in **1000 years** with an “**ancient secret manuscript**” about the Ark of Gabriel. **Patriarch Kirill** traveled to Antarctica allegedly to perform an ancient ritual there. During this period, there was a ""[mass evacuation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKV1ce-jHYs)"" of Antarctica as USA **Special Ops** & **Military** moved in.
12. The [Fallen Angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_angel) are ""**imprisoned**"" in a mountain in Antarctica & are still ""**alive**"" based on research of the forbidden [Book of Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch). Some [Nephilim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim), the giant hybrid offspring of the [Fallen Angels & Daughters of Men](https://bible.org/seriespage/7-sons-god-and-daughters-men-genesis-61-8), could also be ""**flash frozen**"" & trapped there too. [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin), after being evacuated from Antarctica tweeted, [“We are all in danger.  It is evil itself.”](https://www.google.ca/search?q=%E2%80%9CWe+are+all+in+danger.+It+is+evil+itself.%E2%80%9D&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuyomN9qLcAhUxHTQIHdVgA3cQ_AUICygC&biw=1536&bih=759#imgrc=2ieLY5-F284UDM:) along with a photo of a [Antarctica Pyramid](https://www.google.ca/search?q=%E2%80%9CWe+are+all+in+danger.+It+is+evil+itself.%E2%80%9D&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuyomN9qLcAhUxHTQIHdVgA3cQ_AUICygC&biw=1536&bih=759#imgrc=2ieLY5-F284UDM:) in 2016 before the tweet was deleted allegedly.

If scientists discovered anything ""**new**"" that could be ""**weaponized**"", it would be hushed up & kept ""**secret**"" from competing nations & the general public IMO.

63,Three Reasons China Manufactured COVID-19 and How They Did It,557.0,g1xavi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g1xavi/three_reasons_china_manufactured_covid19_and_how/,176.0,1586974111.0,"**1: Age Demographics**

In 1979, China introduced the One Child Policy to control the size of its rapidly growing population. This policy was abolished in 2015, and former *Wall Street Journal* reporter Mei Fong summarized the reasoning behind abolishing the policy as ""The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. **They have this huge crushing demographic crisis as a result of the one-child policy. And if people don't start having more children, they're going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population.""** Fong believed the huge retiree community must be supported, which would severely dampen China’s future growth.

Since the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of this population imbalance is expected to continue, as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which referred to a United Nations projections forecast that **""China will lose 67 million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.”** So it makes sense for China to create a disease that disproportionately affects the elderly.

**2. Trade War Retaliation**

The China-United States trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between the world's two largest national economies. In 2018, President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the intent of forcing it to amend what the U.S. claims are ""unfair trade practices.” Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. **Since 2018, the United States has placed over $600 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.**

China has always seen itself as a world leader; however during the time frame starting from Donald Trump's inauguration until the first confirmed Coronavirus death on January 11th, 2020, the Shanghai SSE Composite Index lost 12% of its overall value, while the United States S&amp;P 500 gained 35%. China was losing its battle for economic supremacy and it's plausible that they wanted to even the score. Since the Coronavirus outbreak, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped as much as 35%, while the SSE has remained relatively steady. The West may have been hit harder from the virus because the three most internationally traveled nations are all located in Europe and North America. With free travel laws, more visitors, and decentralized governments it is much harder for Western Nations to contain an airborne pandemic. Additionally, China did not do its part to warn the rest of the world. Numerous intelligence agencies have stated that China has severely under-reported both deaths and cases. This underreporting is believed to have made other countries less prepared for this virus and helped contribute to its rapid spread across the rest of the globe.

**3. Information Theft**

Despite numerous US video-sharing apps that have been used for years such as Webex, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, and Skype, Zoom has recently taken over the video conferencing market share. **In fact, the two most downloaded apps since the COVID-19 outbreak are Zoom and the trending video app TikTok. Both are Chinese-run applications that have been linked to major security concerns and private data theft.**

Zoom has been banned by Google, NASA, Space X, the Taiwanese Government, the NYC public school district and the German Foreign Ministry. Space X cited “significant privacy and security concerns” and the German Foreign Ministry said that “security and data protection weaknesses made it too risky to use”. Zoom has been linked to stealing logins and passwords, harvesting data, leaking personal information, taking control of users’ microphones and cameras, allowing calls to be routed through whitelisted Chinese servers, call records remaining viewable on the web, and the ability to gain root access to a Mac OS.

TikTok has also amassed numerous concerns. According to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court, TikTok has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China. The lawsuit also accuses the company and its Chinese parent company ByteDance of taking user content such as draft videos without their consent and having ""ambiguous"" privacy policies. It raises concerns that data gathered by TikTok could be used to identify, profile and track users in the US. The company is benefiting from this alleged activity because it uses this data to sell targeted ads, the lawsuit alleges.

Furthermore, Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point has conducted research finding that TikTok has serious vulnerabilities that would have allowed hackers to manipulate user data and reveal personal information. TikTok admitted to some of these mistakes and paid a $5.7 million fine to the United States for stealing data related to children under 13. China has a long history of intellectual property theft, and they were able to enhance their capabilities and global reach during this virus. It seems that China was oddly prepared to capitalize on this pandemic.

**How they did it:**

What we know so far is that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China. **Additionally, China has only** **one** **Top Level-Four Microbiology Lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the National Biosafety Laboratory located in Wuhan.** The first-ever case of a coronavirus outbreak in humans was in 2003 when SARS was first discovered. Over two-thirds of SARS diagnosed cases came from China, making China the first-ever country to be majorly affected by a coronavirus. Prior to COVID-19, there have been less than 100 total diagnosed cases of human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) in the United States and Europe combined. Given the effects of SARS on China, in congruence with the rarity of the disease in the United States and Europe, it is not unreasonable to think that China has been studying coronaviruses more intently and for a longer period of time than any Western nation. In fact, just recently Western nations did not believe that masks helped against coronaviruses, while China has known otherwise for many years.

**Scientists believe that COVID-19 likely originated in a wet market, or natural environment, instead of a laboratory. This is because the RNA of the virus is thought to have been created through zoonotic spillover.** Zoonotic spillover is the transmission of a virus from a vertebrate animal to a human. Scientists believe COVID-19 started from a bat coronavirus which was presumably spread to a pangolin, and then to a human. This is not unique to COVID-19. It is believed that SARS’ inception was also through zoonotic spillover, from bats to civets to humans. MERS is also believed to have been created through zoonotic spillover, from bats to camels to humans.

Many scientists have pointed to zoonotic spillover as the reason COVID-19 started in nature instead of a laboratory. The issue with this argument is that zoonotic spillover does not necessitate mutual exclusivity from human intervention. **It is reasonable to believe that if a group of scientists wanted to spread a deadly coronavirus and cover it up, they would not manufacture a man-made coronavirus. Instead, they would take bats infected with coronavirus, put them in cages with other animals, and study the effects.** There have been many leaked photos from China of primates in cages undergoing inhumane tests in laboratories, so animal atrocities of this kind are neither unprecedented nor uncommon in China.

Although it is possible that COVID-19 could have started in nature, the majority of the world's bat population lives in South America and tropical climates. This makes it less likely that naturally spread coronaviruses would keep originating in China as opposed to elsewhere. **It is much more likely that the only microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the one at the epicenter of the virus outbreak, performed some sort of animal experiment that either intentionally or unintentionally spread outside the laboratory.**

If China didn’t manufacture the virus then they should have nothing to hide. **However, China has banned the publication of research into the origins of COVID-19 without government review and approval.** So much human knowledge could be gained from a world of scientists studying the origins of COVID-19 in order to prevent another pandemic. Instead, China is actively censoring the press and changing the facts. All of this leads me to believe that China manufactured the novel coronavirus and they are trying to cover up and control the narrative.

TL;DR - China has both political and financial motives to create a virus that affects the elderly and the West. China’s only laboratory that experiments with deadly coronaviruses is in Wuhan. With the knowledge that the last two coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, were caused through zoonotic spillover, China performed animal experiments to form a new disease. China has banned information about COVID-19 origins because they are trying to cover up and control the narrative.

**Update 8 hours after posting**: I just checked the news and multiple outlets are reporting that COVID-19 was created in a Wuhan Laboratory. I actually emailed this piece to three major news outlets this morning before posting on Reddit. One of those news sites, Fox News, posted a similar article 8 hours later. The current headline on their website reads, ""**Sources believe coronavirus originated in Wuhan lab as part of China's efforts to compete with US.""** Maybe it’s just a coincidence but either way this is wild!!!

The director of the IMF said on Thursday last week : 

[> Today we face a new Bretton Woods “moment.”](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/10/15/sp101520-a-new-bretton-woods-moment)

[Now, what were the Bretton Woods agreements about ?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp). These were about setting up a new system under which gold was the basis for the U.S. dollar and other currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar’s value. The Bretton Woods Agreement also created two important organizations—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

What could a new Bretton Woods moment mean in this context ? It means they are restructuring the current monetary system. Under the new system, the USD is replaced by a digital currency.

[A central bank-supported digital currency could replace the dollar as the global hedge currency, said Bank of England governor Mark Carney](https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-england-governor-calls-for-digital-currency-replacement-to-the-dollar)

> Carney highlighted the dollar’s use in international securities issuance, its use as the primary settlement currency for international trades and the fact that companies use dollars as examples of its dominance. However, “developments in the U.S. economy, by affecting the dollar exchange rate, can have large spillover effects to the rest of the world.”

[Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted he did not believe private sector involvement in the production of U.S. dollars would be trusted by the citizens. “I do think this is something that the central banks have to design,” Powell said. “The private sector is not involved in creating the money supply, that’s something the central bank does.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/08/13/federal-reserve-reveals-research-plans-for-digital-dollar/#7f254a205946)

As if it was not obvious, central banks don't want a bitcoin/dogecoin/monero/pokemoncoin, etc... currency. They want to fully control the new digital currency, like they control current fiat currencies.

Back to the IMF director's speech, she states 3 imperatives moving forward : the first 2 are about economic policies, and the 3rd one is about climate change. 

> Just as the pandemic has shown that we can no longer ignore health precautions, we can no longer afford to ignore climate change—my third imperative.

That 3rd one is surprising. What does climate change has to do with the IMF and the definition of a new monetary system ?

[Here is a very interesting article about how this all relates to bill gates' mass vaccination agenda](https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/bill-gates-calls-for-a-digital-certificate-to-identify-who-is-vaccinated/).

> In an article published by ID2020 in 2018, vaccines are the perfect way to introduce digital identity to the world – especially infants. This identity would also be used to grant access to basic rights and services.

Your new digital ID will then be matched with your new digital currency issued by your central bank. They will have the absolute, uncontested right to decide whether you can have access to basic rights and services, or not. It will only take a click on the mouse to deny your access to basic rights and services. And you won't know the reason. It could be for wrong thinking, it could be to pursue another political agenda to eliminate whichever community they decided they need to eliminate. We have seen plenty of evidence this year about the strong political bias that big social media platforms have. Now, with the constant monitoring and analyzing of our data, they can easily tell what are our political opinions. And therefore have your access to basic rights and services denied with a click, if you have the 'wrong' political opinions. And I don't see why they would not do that. In a very close future, you could end up in a situation where you have to choose between being allowed to eat, or vote for the candidate you don't like, but that the system endorses. It's literally the end of democracy, and freedom, and there is no going back once we have switched to this new system.

All the above is not even a conspiracy. It's merely about connecting the dots, and understanding the implications.

We are the pawns. China and America pretend to be on opposite sides but, don’t worry, it’s just a game. 

If they make a wrong move their pawn dies, not them. They both live to play another friendly game. And, like democrats and republicans, they will join forces and attack whoever dares to threaten their game. 

Chinese and American elites both have the same goal - to be masters of the universe. Literally. But they won’t reach this goal for hundreds of years. Their goal of being gods on earth, however, is close to coming true.

This instinct - to be the alpha - has been with us since homo habilis walked the earth 2.8 million years ago. 

However, in sociopaths and psychopaths the determination to be the “alpha” is incredibly strong. And we know sociopaths are over represented in elite circles. So, the elite embrace a “dog eat dog” mentality. While being outwardly charming they hate you because they “know” you are inferior to them.  Sound familiar?

Sociopathy has many societal advantages if you don’t mind not having a conscience. Sociopaths make great surgeons because they can make “rational” decisions “unclouded” by emotion. (Notice how even our language is pro-sociopath. Being emotional doesn’t mean you care, it means you are irrational).

So, to summarise - in capitalism or communism power and wealth is likely to be in the hands of sociopaths. Sociopathy is genetic and is enhanced by socialisation with other sociopaths.

Power and wealth leads to a mindset that strides decades and even centuries. They are obsessed with keeping their wealth and power. Keeping their genetic superiority alive.

Sociopathy in intergenerational families is common. Their children regularly “fight” each other to take over from the alpha. (Murdoch, Rothschild, Trump etc). They prove themselves by how much they can exploit people. 

This is why they just never give their money away. We all ask why hasn’t Bill Gates or Bezos given some of it to help the poor?

Answer? They see the poor as subhuman. It’s nothing personal. Sociopaths see everyone but themselves as pray. Why waste money on genetic failures? (I don’t believe this, just trying to give you my take on how they think). 

Instead, they would not help them, they would exploit them. It’s the rational thing to do if you are selfish, feel superior, love playing mind games and cannot feel guilt. 

So, to the sociopathic elite in China and America they choose to exploit the people for money? Why not experiment on them too? They are really only farm animals to be tagged (see Elon Musk’s Neuralink). Just meat bags for Beta testing.

The elite’s values and beliefs are the same as fundamentalists in all religions:

-	The Earth is theirs and sub-humans are killing it.  
-	The enlightened elite will inherit the Earth (but first they must save it)


Their methods are:

-	Thin the herd - kill the poor because they are genetically inferior. 

-	Enhance my own genetic superiority through crispr and gene splicing. They want to look as superior as they feel. 

-	Embrace science not for social good but for personal benefit and profit.

Remember, the acquisition and use of power isn’t a method to them. It’s the whole point. The end goal is to hold on to that power forever. (If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever. - George Orwell).

Once the elites achieve genetic perfection and make AI their slave they might look like gods to a new generation that knows no different.

Once AI is their slave they don’t need billions of humans to make things and invent things. They can kill off these stupid vermin. 

Perhaps the Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, will get his wish to come back as a deadly virus to kill half the worlds population. 

But right now, the elite are scared of us. They know that if billions of people woke up, no army on earth could save them. So, once they have drones, nuclear bombs and AI, they will
neither need us or want us. 

Killing billions will create a manageable population of surfs to do their bidding. After all, a god is only a god if there are people to worship him. 

One current example of elites in America and China working as one:

-	Covid-19. Both elites have the same goals for their countries and the world - a dystopian panopticon. They need to control the masses that they fear so much.

This pandemic helps them reach their goal. It’s a move as important as a world war. Notice how China is back to normal. It would be because the pandemic needs to strip Americans of their rights. 

In China the pandemic can be allowed to vanish because they don’t have any rights to start with. China’s only task was to demonstrate to the people of the world that authoritarianism “saved” people from an awful plague. How noble authoritarianism must be. /s

Another example:

-	Globalisation. No normal human would export all America jobs to China. But someone with no conscience, who would benefit financially would. It’s a win/win. It enriches them and makes the people weak and exploitable.


But why allow China to get rich? They have common interests - China and America both have something each other need. 

China has mastered authoritarian dystopia because human rights and democracy were never embedded in Chinese society as they are in America.  Chinese authoritarianism, would be a great prize to American elites.

China needs technological know-how and financial credibility. In China, break through innovation is rare. America is good at this. China is amazing at innovating an existing invention but totally new technological paradigm - like electricity, rockets, GPS, Crispr etc etc - is America’s finest asset. And stealing it only gets them so far. They are always on the back foot.


America has technological, scientific, military and financial superiority - for now.  But the elites in America look upon enviously at how well China has control of its masses. They want that. And they will use the “threat” of China to get it.

It’s a perfect match.


**The human rights you “enjoy” now in the West are to be destroyed.**

As an aside, when did we start using the word “enjoy” in relation to our human rights? Like it’s something that has been given to us. Rather than something we are born with. They are our inalienable rights, right? Don’t worry about all that. As George W Bush said - the Constitution is “just a piece of paper.”

But, you say, I have human rights now. America is not like China. You’re right, at the moment it isn’t. But you aren’t getting more free. You aren’t getting more rights, you aren’t getting richer or healthier. 

Property rights etc have already been undermined. And, via the billy club of Climate Change, more rights will be stripped away. 


Any human rights and social benefits we enjoy today have been inherited. Any human right we have been given, that involved the sharing of power with the elite, has been given to us when non-sociopaths gain power. This doesn’t last long and the sociopaths then spend the following years slowly taking those rights away. 

Don’t mistake recent new “rights” as being the same as fundamental rights like free speech (which is on life support) or Habeas Corpus (unless you are in a Black site like Guantánamo).

A recent new “right” would be the right for gay people to marry. I am gay and I welcome it but it involves no relinquishing of power by the elite. In that sense it isn’t a right at all. It actually benefited the elite and that’s why they did it/allowed it to be done. It helps reduce the population and it divides America a bit more.

So, is there a man behind the curtain pulling all the strings? 

No. Its more clever than that. It’s cultural. It’s genetic. It’s just how they are. Leave a puppy in the middle of an island all by itself and he will grow up and act like a dog despite never seeing one. And, if he saw a dog, he would recognise they were the same. He would make friends with the new dog. The dogs have names. One is called America. The other Is China. And we are their lunch.

But, hey, don’t worry. “Change is gonna come.” Just one more election. One more vote for Hope. One more vote to “make America great again.” 

Notice how no political party has ever said to the voter - you need to riot. This place is corrupt. Burn it down and we’ll start again. 

Trump tried this after 2016 but then “Q” arrived and said “not yet. Just wait. One more week. One more month. One more term and then he’ll really help you. Trust us. Who else have you got? What the hell have you got to lose?” 

I’m sure Biden is different. The latest “change” candidate would never never be caught on a hot mic telling his donors that “nothing would fundamentally change.” /s

https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/

Finally, don’t beat yourself up about this. It’s not our fault. We were born into it. We don’t know what life was like “before.” And that is also deliberate. 

Remember “the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world” and today that hand is Disney and Amazon. 

The media. Disney etc, controls what we value. Consumerism and marketing depends on the ability to shape our opinions so well that it results in us buying that iPhone or whatever. 

So, if we could  identify what we don’t value. If we could identify what we’ve been implicitly taught not to value we’d discover what truly had value. Right? So what could that be. This is my personal list:

History

-	We are trained to ignore history. To not read it in any detail. Even if we do read it it’s always a modern take on history. We rarely read the original text of powerful people and when we do it is tame things like Shakespeare. 
-	The reason history is not valued is it reveals the elite’s game.  It’s like a powerful time machine and, with a time machine you can see patterns over time. Who keeps winning, who keeps losing etc. If you look hard enough and are persistent nothing is hidden from you. That scares them.
-	History is like a treasure chest. It gives you all the best writing by non-sociopaths, people who worked for the benefit of all. These must have been remarkable people to win against incredible odds. Their writing has power. Their thoughts are ones the elite want to make illegal. Please just forget you have rights. 
-	And if do know their names - MLK for example - it will trigger boredom. School lessons and drab books and perhaps a few words from him. But it will he edited. Did you know MLK was not for peaceful protests if they were shown not to work? He had a whole philosophy of achieving fairness and equality for the people through economc justice (I expect a few of you reading this have been trained to flinch at the word “equality”. As I said, the elite are clever).  
-	MLK is now used by the elite to keep black people “in line.”  The elite use him as a totem. Whenever black people are just exhausted at the injustice and some protest or even riot. MLK is rolled out. But they dont roll out the MLK that justified violence if non-viollence didnt work. 
-	Real history. Unedited history.  Cannot he found easily. You must search for dusty first person accounts, old and hard to find books and dig into niche old newspapers. 
-	Researching this way is the mental equivalent of letting off a nuclear bomb. Over time it reveals their old plans because you can finally see beyond your nose and what you see and read is something real. You’ll know it when you see it. Hell, you’ll feel it. 
-	Your horizon lifts. You are no longer strapped to the front of a speeding truck with “breaking news” and “content” hitting you like hundreds of files. 
-	With the power of history you find yourself sharing the vantage point of the elite. You can trace daily decisions over time and see what their result truly is. You can see patterns of behaviour of action and inaction which culminate in a vaguely familiar story from history but what you’ve read - how history became history - will be radically different  from what you’ve been taught. But more likely you are not taught anything about it. You didn’t miss what you never had.

Check you MLK’s speech on economic justice here: https://youtu.be/dOWDtDUKz-U

In one area or another we are all the boiling frog. In one area or topic we are determined to delude ourselves rather than admit to having been duped by others.  We like the warmth of self-deception too much in the slow burning pot to let ourselves realise it’s killing us. 


As an aside, wouldn’t it be great for the elite if someone started a protest which told everyone if they read the works of great men of history they would be a racist? Perhaps we should even take down their statues so there aren’t these giant reminders around all these plebs? 

I am not defending racists here. I think we can condemn a historical figure’s racism  while at the same time appreciating the non-racist messages and great works of art they created. It’s odd how we must destroy the evidence of racist historical figures (who mainly wrote about human rights) but we’re supposed to pretend the two current presidential candidates have never said racist things themselves.

Other things on my list which we are meant to not value: 

-	Motherhood
-	Fatherhood  
-	Family - not just immediate but your extended family too 
-	Community 
-	Living independently with nature


I’ll stop there. My fingers are getting sore and I’m starting to ramble.

Depopulation, Revolution, or Mass Overhaul are our options.",493.0,prmvbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/prmvbr/hey_conspiracy_friends_weve_hit_a_societal/,124.0,1632109053.0,"
WARNING: This is a long, LONG Post. It may be one of the most important posts on this sub in awhile because it’s true, spoken from the heart, and coming from a place of immense worry and thoughtfulness. If you don’t have the time to read, please skip this post to another. 

First, thank you all for taking the time to read this. I will cut right to the chase, but I want to warn the shills/bots, this post is not for you. I seldom have time to interact with NPCs, much the less the desire to.

So let’s proceed. Australia has fallen. Canada is in the midst of falling. Europe is looking bleak. There are mass protests all over the globe. Awareness is growing faster than censorship can keep up with. 

We are at a crossroads in our society. We are at the point of no return. The globalists, the Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission, The World Economic Forum, The United Nations,  The Gates Foundation, The Elites; whatever you want to call them or label them as, have gone all in. (At this point if you don’t recognize some of these groups, it is essential to understanding them.) 

If you deny this much, stop reading here. This post is too much for you and you have much homework to do if you believe our leaders of any party, three letter agency, or politicians give a single shit about you. They don’t. Go back to your safe space because this post is about reality.

The teeter totter hypothesis proposes that society happens in cycles, and eventually when a cycle is made, there can only be one outcome, the question is, how do we decide the outcome?

We must weigh our options carefully to keep the teeter totter balanced. But eventually societies and nations collapse. Even the great ones. Sumerians fell. Egyptians fell. Greeks fell. The Romans fell. The Aztecs fell. The Mayans fell. Germany fell. The USSR fell. 

A myriad of cultures, languages, political systems, capital systems, ideologies, races, all fell in due time. It is the way of life, but time marches forward, and like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, man also lifts himself up after the worst of tragedies, wars, and famine.

The United States is currently that society falling. I realize Reddit is much bigger than America, but the brutal truth, despite the massive disinformation campaign globally to make America seem inept after years of Trump, is that we are the leading hub of the world. I’m just about every metric. We are the leading cultural hub of the world. We are the largest consumers. We produce entertainment through Hollywood and music. We have the most public companies. New York City is the center of finance in the world. Silicon Valley is the center of technological progress. We have the largest military in the world. 

And yet, we have failed.

America has failed. Some have connected the dots and realized this, some haven’t, some still believe in their futile attempts to resurrect a nation that time has passed by. To my next point, again I reiterate, if you believe any democratic or Republican politician, Biden, Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, AOC, etc. is going to save you, stop reading. You have much homework to do. We are entirely past that. No three letter agency or institution is going to come to your rescue.

We have been domesticated as a species to accept our mundane way of life the past 6 decades. You go to school to get a job to pay your taxes to have children and continue the cycle. You hopefully enjoy a hobby or two, a musical instrument, play a sport, read some books, and then you die. 

We have lost all spiritual and religious connection. The almighty dollar and the rat race to the bottom fuels all. Communism doesn’t work, and capitalism is the best we have. Rules for thee, but not for me. There is no middle class. That’s a myth. There’s only those with capital, the poor, and the less poor. Humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth. The difference between 100k and 1 million, isn’t all that different than 1 million and 1 billion to the average mind who considers these numbers an after thought. The fact that the top tax brackets ends at 400k and upward is a travesty when one considers the wealth of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.

The ‘leaders’, whether elected or not (looking at you Klaus Schwab), have planted their flags into the ground and made their global stance known. In order to form a global government, a government of a global people with a common goal and ideology, nationalism, capitalism, borders, and pride in your nation must be eradicated and driven out. 

No matter your views on origin, treatment, or the real facts of Covid, one thing is certain. The elite class has taken advantage of the opportunities at every turn. If you cannot see the writing on the wall, again, please stop reading. Go to another sub. This is the conspiracy sub, not CNN or WorldNews. There they will coddle you and reinforce the sheep narrative of confirmation bias with a revolving door echo chamber.

The grim reality is that society is a carefully crafted illusion that is a house of cards. If businesses stopped worldwide even for a day, the system collapses. If the world currency exchange quit relying on the US Dollar and Federal Reserve, the world collapses. We are mere moments at any given time from complete anarchy. This is why these elites, no matter how high they perceive themselves in a world of lesser people, have to be kept somewhat in check. Mass societies turning on their politicians (public servants) is all it takes for a complete revolution.

They have to keep things balanced to maintain order and the illusion of a society that knows no bounds and life is just peachy. 

Now with AI and tech surpassing prior levels of understanding at a rapid pace, the world is changing. Soon there will be no need for police officers. Robotic entities will replace them. Every cashier will be replaced. Every mundane function will be replaced. In time, these giant monopolistic corporations will be able to produce revenue without you. At that point we will be expendable. Cattle. Leeches of a dying system. And it’s coming. You can deny it, run from it, stall it, but it’ll inevitably arrive all the same. The only choice you DO have is how you will react in this lifetime. 

Many or most of this entire generation doesn’t know the harsh realities of history. They have lived in relative times of peace and prosperity. Even the poor in this country will have an iPhone with a roof over their head and a warm meal to keep them from starvation. 

The first possible solution is depopulation. It’s a relatively simple decision to arrive at. There are too many people. Not enough resources. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs. Too much healthcare costs. Fiat money is collapsing under inflation in real time. Climate change will cause large swaths of populations to have to migrate to other lands. Foot shortages and supply chain breakdowns are inevitable. The cozy life you know of being able to get anything and everything down the street at the local Walmart is winding to an end. 

So it seems like a decent proposition to the global elite. The populace is waking up. Kill them off. Reset the system. And educate (propaganda) the youth to reteach them everything about our society. After all, history is written by the victors, not the losers. 

To anyone wondering why Covid would be used to depopulate us and what they have to gain, that’s a large part of that answer. The fourth industrial revolution. So according to this option, we surrender, most die through one means or another, and we place our trust in a global syndicate that has laid out a path and foundation for society to progress forward, albeit in vastly smaller numbers of people. 

Option 2. Revolution. 

You can only achieve so much in this world by peaceful and meaningful protesting. Nobody wants violence. Nobody wants bloodshed. Most of humanity just wants their right to liberty and freedom, to spend cherished time with their loved ones, and perhaps even contribute to society in a great way. We just want to be left alone. 

But when you push people into a corner, much the way a scared animal reacts, people will snap if you push them too far. When a percentage of society hates you just for being white, or straight, or believing in a higher power than themselves, our society has been lost past the point of return. Divide and conquer is a real strategy that has been taking place for millennia. Their biggest free is our solidarity and unity; humanity taking care of themselves and uniting no matter their race, gender, political affiliation, age, culture, or economic background, against the very people who try to divide and distract us from the real evils of society.

The narrative shifts when it suits their purposes. Notice how the previous summer the BLM riots and destruction were justified in the eyes of the elites? They were entitled to it. It was for a just cause. But yet, when much more peaceful protests happens at the nations capitol, in the oddest, most unique election in our nations history believe there is foul play and protest, they are criminals. Any time true protests or riots happen, suddenly they are painted and smeared by the media. If we went by today’s standards, these same politicians would have you convinced that our founding fathers in 1776 were insurrectionists against England. 

Well no shit. That’s the point, the people had enough and revolted. No taxation without representation. Take your laws, kings, and unjust taxes and shove it up your ass. We no longer comply and submit to the King or any of their bestowed leaders. We are a United Nation of free people with the right to pursue life and liberty. 

…but today, our nation is being slowly brainwashed into believing we are all an evil divided people who must look to those very same leaders who sought so many generations ago to escape. Real revolution  requires this. It’s an undeniable fact. No real revolution has ever been spurred by protestors sitting in the streets stopping traffic with “tax the rich” signs. It happens when leaders lose their carefully crafted grip on the people and no longer can control them, forcing them to relinquish power and submit to the will of the people, 

The last and least likely option is mass overhaul. This would’ve been possible in simpler times. But the tentacles of this empire make Rome look like Child’s play. When corruption spans many nations and peoples, let alone the agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI, FDA, IRS, NIH, WHO, CDC, FDA, etc. 

It’s lost. It’s too far gone. And overhauling a system spanning decades of infiltrated corruption is impossible. It must be completely eradicated from the foundation up. Our founding fathers tried their best to ensure we would never be overtaken. They knew from the very beginning, if America fell, it would be from within its own borders, not externally from another source. 

The media, big pharma, big tech, big government, and the military industrial complex have consolidated so much power it’s just simply not conceivable to overhaul such a vast and broken system. 


We are now at a crossroads in humanity. Our leaders have failed us. Our public servants betrayed us. Our CEOs enslaved us. 

The teeter totter is starting to rock back and forth, losing its balance. The scales are tipping. The only control they have over it is censorship and age old techniques to convince the populace of their desired outcome through mass scale propaganda. 

I want you to ask yourself. In 20, 30, 40 years, will you be able to look in the eyes or your child, and explain to them how we let it get so bad? Will you be able to justify staying silent? Because you were scared to lose your reputation? Your job? Your friends? 

Because that time is coming. Our world is changing. Tech is replacing God. Public education is replacing wisdom. Adultery and greed is replacing love and selflessness. Our history is being erased and rewritten. Our freedoms are slowly eroding away in the name of safety. Our privacy is slowly being stripped in the name of security. Our data is being harvested and sold to the highest bidder to keep us in this perpetual never ending cycle of a slow descent into hell. 

I don’t care if your leader is Ghandi, Biden, Jesus, Mohammed, Trump, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It is time to unite as a people and reclaim our rights as a humanity. To love our neighbor. To give back to the less fortunate. To extend our hand and help one another. To show love and freedom of expression. 

Because if we don’t. Make no mistake the teeter totter will continue to tip. And it will eventually tip the scale towards depopulation or revolution. I only ask that we come together as a society, as a United people before it is too late.

**Operation Earnest Voice**

Operation Earnest Voice (OEV) is a communications program by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.

Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:

Fifty user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.

>The largest undercover force the world has ever known is the one created by the Pentagon over the past decade. Some **60,000 people** now belong to this secret army, many working under masked identities and in low profile, all part of a broad program called ""signature reduction."" The force, more than ten times the size of the clandestine elements of the CIA, carries out domestic and foreign assignments, both in military uniforms and under civilian cover, **in real life and online**, sometimes hiding in private businesses and consultancies, some of them household name companies.

Inside Israel’s million dollar troll army

A global influence campaign funded by the Israeli government had a $1.1 million budget last year, a document obtained by The Electronic Intifada shows.

Act.IL says it has offices in three countries and an online army of more than 15,000.

The German Club of Clear Words takes a deep dive into the network of individuals and organizations responsible for the COVID scam

Whether blatantly visible or not, you can identify just about any network by connecting dots between individuals and organizations. Who’s working with whom, where, and why? Who’s paying whom? And once you’ve done that, you can more clearly identify the motivations behind various decisions

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation appears to be near the top, or the center, of this COVID plandemic network. Gates is also a major funder of mainstream media, and his network extends into global food and climate change policy

The Gates Foundation, through its funding of the WEF, also plays an important role in The Great Reset, which was officially unveiled during a WEF summit in May 2020

Every conceivable aspect of life and society is scheduled to be “reset” according to their plan. Ultimately, that’s where this criminal COVID enterprise is trying to take us.

Those people are now trying to reshape the world via the CV-19 fear-based agenda in order to gain more power and control for themselves and bring about an AI-controlled dystopian future that benefits them even more greatly. Ignore it at your own peril. They call it The Great Reset. It involves travel restrictions, tracking, tracing, mandatory vaccination, monitoring, surveillance, digital currency, 5G to implement the global control, etc. Its all right there on their own website... plain as day. They aren't even hiding it from the public anymore.

Excerpt:

Amendments to legislation have affected USAGM's governing authorities and organizational structure by shifting authority from a bipartisan board to a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with advice from an Advisory Board. Network and USAGM officials said that previous members of USAGM leadership took several actions that did not align with USAGM's firewall principles. According to USAGM, the firewall protecting the networks' independence is central to the credibility and effectiveness of USAGM's networks (see fig.). However, the parameters of the firewall are not specifically laid out in legislation. Delineation of what is and is not permissible under the firewall may help ensure the professional independence and integrity of the agency and its networks.

Actions to ensure accountability of grantees, such as establishing Standard Operating Procedures for Monitoring Grants , have not corrected a longstanding significant deficiency in grants monitoring reported by independent audits of USAGM's financial statements for the past 5 years.

The following is primarily a timeline of information relevant to what is discussed by Klaus Schwab, the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, which describes itself as ""the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation"". This timeline will present information based on the themes of what Shwab calls the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"", as well as potential crises that could allow for the acceleration of its implementation.



**June 22-23, 2001**: ""The [*Dark Winter*](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events-archive/2001_dark-winter/) exercise, held at Andrews AFB, Washington, DC, June 22-23, 2001, portrayed a fictional scenario depicting a covert smallpox attack on US citizens.""

**January 14, 2005**: ""[Atlantic Storm](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020090646/http://www.atlantic-storm.org/about.html) was a ministerial table-top exercise convened on January 14, 2005 by the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the Johns Hopkins University, and the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network. The exercise used a fictitious scenario designed to mimic a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond to a bioterrorist attack.""

""During the six hour meeting, the transatlantic leaders wrestled with the enormity and rapid pace of the emerging epidemics of smallpox, the tension between domestic politics and international relations, the challenge of controlling the movement of people across borders, and an international shortage of critical medical resources such as smallpox vaccine.""

**September 7-8, 2006**: [Black ICE (Bioterrorism International Coordination Exercise)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090314080914/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/79521.pdf)

""In the Black ICE scenario six terrorists from South Asia self-infect with smallpox and, while they are at their most contagious, travel by air to Central Asia. During their travel and upon arrival, the terrorists infect as many people as possible with the disease. National response capabilities are quickly overwhelmed and governments call upon international organizations for assistance in areas such as disease diagnosis and interventions, public health and law enforcement investigations, coordinating transportation policies, and managing displaced populations.""

""The Chinese government’s quick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens, as well as its instant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of lives, stopping the spread of the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter postpandemic recovery."" (Page 18)

""During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified."" (Page 19) 

""In developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: **biometric IDs for all citizens**, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests."" (Page 19)

""Consequently, the United Nations Secretary-General and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed with the World Economic Forum jointly to advance public-private cooperation, action and ambition on climate change and broader sustainability issues."" (Page 33)

""Companies that deal with sensitive and critical information such as **those in financial services should put cyberattacks at the top of their list of risks**. While CEOs and corporate boards are increasingly becoming aware of the threat, not everyone knows how to respond to it effectively. In today’s hyperconnected world, companies need to have dedicated IT teams to constantly monitor technology systems and devise ways to repel cyber attacks. Encryption is another line of defence as is two-factor verification – requiring a username and password; **use of biometric information, such as fingerprints and DNA**, are also useful techniques.""

Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance: ""Daszak reiterated that, until an infectious disease crisis is very real, present, and at an emergency threshold, it is often largely ignored. To sustain the funding base beyond the crisis, he said, we need to increase public understanding of the need for MCMs such as a pan-influenza or **pancoronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics follow the hype.** We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of process, Daszak stated."" (Page 73)

""Modern conflicts involving states are increasingly 'hybrid' in nature, combining traditional battlefield techniques with elements previously associated with nonstate actors. The distinction between war and peace, combatant and noncombatant, and even violence and nonviolence (think cyberwarfare) is becoming uncomfortably blurry.""

""...the tracking and sharing of information about us is a crucial part of the new connectivity. Debates about fundamental issues such as the impact on our inner lives of the loss of control over our data will only intensify in the years ahead. Similarly, the revolutions occurring in biotechnology and AI, which are redefining what it means to be human by pushing back the current thresholds of life span, health, cognition, and capabilities, will compel us to redefine our moral and ethical boundaries.""

""Going direct means the central bank finding ways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders. Going direct, which can be organised in a variety of different ways, works by: 1) bypassing the interest rate channel when this traditional central bank toolkit is exhausted, and; 2) enforcing policy coordination so that the fiscal expansion does not lead to an offsetting increase in interest rates. 

An extreme form of 'going direct' would be an explicit and permanent monetary financing of a fiscal expansion, or so-called helicopter money."" (Page 2)

""...in a downturn the only solution is for a more formal – and historically unusual – coordination of monetary and fiscal policy to provide effective stimulus."" (Page 8)

""Any additional measures to stimulate economic growth will have to go beyond the interest rate channel and 'go direct' – when a central bank crediting private or public sector accounts directly with money. One way or another, this will mean subsidising spending – and such a measure would be fiscal rather than monetary by design. This can be done directly through fiscal policy or by expanding the monetary policy toolkit with an instrument that will be fiscal in nature, such as credit easing by way of buying equities. This implies that an effective stimulus would require coordination between monetary and fiscal policy – be it implicitly or explicitly."" (Page 8)

So — I’ve been silent for some weeks. Forgive me.

The truth is: I’ve been rendered almost speechless — or the literary equivalent of that — because in the last little while I’ve had the unenviable task of trying to announce to the world that indeed, a genocide — or what I’ve called, clumsily but urgently, a “baby die-off” — is underway.

The WarRoom/DailyClout Pfizer Documents Research Volunteers, a group of 3000 highly credentialled doctors, RNs, biostatisticians, medical fraud investigators, lab clinicians and research scientists, have been turning out report after report, as you may know, to tell the world what is in the 55,000 internal Pfizer documents which the FDA had asked a court to keep under wraps for 75 years. By court order, these documents were forcibly disclosed. And our experts are serving humanity by reading through these documents and explaining them in lay terms. You can find all of the Volunteers’ reports on DailyClout.io.

The lies revealed are stunning.

The WarRoom/DailyClout Volunteers have confirmed: that Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew by December 2020 that the MRNA vaccines did not work — that they “waned in efficacy” and presented “vaccine failure.” One side effect of getting vaccinated, as they knew by one month after the mass 2020 rollout, was “COVID.”

Pfizer knew in May of 2021 that 35 minors’ hearts had been damaged a week after MRNA injection — but the FDA rolled out the EUA for teens a month later anyway, and parents did not get a press release from the US government about heart harms til August of 2021, after thousands of teens were vaccinated. \[[https://dailyclout.io/pfizer-vaccine-fda-fails-to-mention-risk-of-heart-damage-in-teens/\]](https://dailyclout.io/pfizer-vaccine-fda-fails-to-mention-risk-of-heart-damage-in-teens/])

Pfizer (and thus the FDA; many of the documents say “FDA: CONFIDENTIAL” at the lower boundary) knew that, contrary to what the highly paid spokesmodels and bought-off physicians were assuring people, the MRNA, spike protein and lipid nanoparticles did not stay in the injection side in the deltoid, but rather went, within 48 hours into the bloodstream, from there to lodge in the liver, spleen, adrenals, lymph nodes, and, if you are a woman, in the ovaries. \[[https://dailyclout.io/internal-pfizer-documents-prove-knowledge-that-lipid-nanoparticles-in-mice-subjects-do-not-remain-in-muscle-but-were-shown-to-be-rapidly-distributed-in-the-blood-to-the-liver/\]](https://dailyclout.io/internal-pfizer-documents-prove-knowledge-that-lipid-nanoparticles-in-mice-subjects-do-not-remain-in-muscle-but-were-shown-to-be-rapidly-distributed-in-the-blood-to-the-liver/])

Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew that the Moderna vaccine had 100 mcg of MRNA, lipid nanoparticles and spike protein, which amount was more than three times the 30 mcg of the adult Pfizer dose; the company’s internal documents show a higher rate of adverse events with the 100 mcg dose, so they stopped experimenting with that amount internally due to its “reactogenicity” — Pfizer’s words — but no one told all of the millions of Americans who all got the first and second 100 mcg Moderna dose, *and the boosters —* that the 100 mcg dose was proven to be damaging, so to maybe skip the booster, or slow it all down.

Pfizer skewed the trial subjects so that almost three quarters were female — a gender that is less prone to cardiac damage. Pfizer *lost* the records of what became of hundreds of their trial subjects.

In the internal trials, there were over 42,000 adverse events and more than 1200 people died. Four of the people who died, *died on the day they were injected.*

Adverse events tallied up in the internal Pfizer documents are completely different from those reported on the CDC website or announced by fully corrupted physicians and medical organizations and hospitals. They include vast columns of joint pain, muscle pain (myalgia), masses of neurological effects include MS, Guillaine Barre and Bell’s Palsy, encephaly, every iteration possible of blood clotting, thrombocytopenia at scale, strokes, hemorrhages, and many kinds of ruptures of membranes throughout the human body. The side effects about which Pfizer and the FDA knew but you did not, include blistering problems, rashes, shingles, and herpetic conditions (indeed, a range of blistering conditions oddly foreshadowing the symptoms of monkeypox).

The internal documents show that Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew that angry red welts or hives were a common reaction to the PEG, a petroleum-derived allergen in the vaccine ingredients — one that you are certainly not supposed to ingest. Indeed, PEG is an allergen so severe that many people can go into anaphylactic shock if they are exposed to it. But people with a PEG allergy were not warned away from the vaccines or even carefully watched by their doctors, EpiPen in hand, post-vaccination. They were left to their shock.

Pfizer knew that “exposure” to the vaccine was defined — in their own words - as sexual contact (especially at time of conception), skin contact, inhalation or lactation. \[[https://dailyclout.io/vaccine-shedding-can-this-be-real-after-all/\]](https://dailyclout.io/vaccine-shedding-can-this-be-real-after-all/]). Fact-checkers can deny this all they want. The documents speak for themselves.

Of course, people who have tried to raise any of these issues have been deplatformed, scolded by the President, called insane, and roundly punished.

Athletes and college students and teenagers are collapsing on football and soccer fields. Doctors wring their hands and express mystification. But BioNTech’s SEC filing shows a fact about which the CDC and the AMA breathe not a word: fainting so violently that you may hurt yourself is one of the disclosed side effects important enough for BioNTech to highlight to the SEC.

But not to highlight to you and me.

I was able to process all of this and keep simply reporting. But in the last few weeks the horror has overcome me. Because in the last few weeks the Volunteers, under the excellent leadership of Program Manager Amy Kelly, have confirmed that there is a genocide underway, intentionally driven or not. And Israeli journalist Etana Hecht has added her own superb analysis. Here is Ms Hecht’s summary of the Volunteers’ findings:

[**Clown World - HonkVaccinated Women**The topic of pregnant and nursing moms getting vaccinated under encouragement and coercion is painful. It’s painful to research, painful to write about, and painful to learn how carelessly the most precious among us are being treated. The very essence of life and nature live within pregnant and nursing mothers.

It seems that there can indeed be a happenstance genocide. Reproduction itself is targeted, intentionally or not, by the mRNA vaccines. And if you know that reproduction is harmed, and babies and fetuses are harmed, and you know that this at scale, which everyone at Pfizer and at the FDA who read these documents, knew —and you do not stop — does that not ultimately become a genocide?

The WarRoom/DailyClout volunteers have confirmed that lipid nanoparticles, the tiny hard fatty casings that contains the MRNA, traverse the amniotic membrane. That means that they enter the fetal environment, of course. (They also traverse the blood-brain barrier, which may help explain the post-MRNA vaccination strokes and cognitive issues we are seeing). The Volunteers have drilled deep into the Pfizer document’s reports about pregnancy and found that the assurance that the vaccine is “safe and effective” for pregnant women, was based on a study of 44 French rats, followed for 42 days (the scientists who ran the study are shareholders or employees of BioNTech). \[[https://dailyclout.io/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-risky-business/\]](https://dailyclout.io/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-risky-business/])

The Volunteers found that while pregnant women were excluded from the internal studies, and thus from the EUA on which basis all pregnant women were assured the vaccine was “safe and effective”, nonetheless about 270 women got pregnant during the study. More than 230 of them were lost somehow to history. But of the 36 pregnant women whose outcomes were followed - *28 lost their babies.*

The Volunteers found that a baby died after nursing from a vaccinated lactating mother, and was found to have had an inflamed liver. Many babies nursing from vaccinated mothers showed agitation, gastrointestinal distress, and failure to thrive (to grow), and were inconsolable.

I am hearing anecdotal reports of these symptoms in babies nursing from vaccinated mothers, now, from across the country.

The Pfizer documents also show that some vaccinated mothers had suppressed lactation, or could produce no milk at all.

Doctors, of course, are stumped by all this. Stumped.

The NIH database has a preprint study making the case that there are negligible amounts of PEG in the breast milk of vaccinated women. \[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/])

But what is a negligible amount of a petroleum product in mother’s milk, when you are a tiny newborn with no immunities, just arriving in the world? The NIH preprint itself reported higher levels of GI distress and sleeplessness in the infants studied, and one mother had elevated PEG levels in breast milk, and the fine print concludes that more study is needed:

“Larger studies are needed to increase our understanding of transfer of PEG into human milk, and potential effects after ingestion by the infant. Although expert consensus states there is minimal or no potential risk for the infant from maternal COVID-19 vaccination([20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/#R20),[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/#R21)), the minor symptoms that were reported (sleep changes and gastrointestinal symptoms) could be further investigated in future studies to determine if they are related to vaccination.”

Since no babies *died* in the brief time frame of the tiny study, the study concluded that nursing babies suffered no real ill effects from vaccinated mothers. But the study did not follow these poor babies, with their acknowledged sleeplessness and their confirmed GI distress, to see if they actually “thrived” — gained weight and developed normally.

On such faulty science were women assured that the vaccines were “safe and effective” for them and their nursing babies.

But — four of the lactating vaccinated women in the Pfizer documents reported “blue-green” breast milk. I am not making this up. And the nursing baby who died, with an inflamed liver — the case has been buried; has not made headlines.

Coincidentally — or not — the SAME FDA that turned a blind eye to vast harms to humans, and to the subcategory of moms and babies, in the Pfizer documents, declared that Abbot, a major producer of baby formula in the US, had to close its factory. \[[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/abbott-reaches-agreement-with-fda-to-reopen-baby-formula-plant-to-ease-nationwide-shortage.html\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/abbott-reaches-agreement-with-fda-to-reopen-baby-formula-plant-to-ease-nationwide-shortage.html])

Coincidentally, with little formula available and with some or many (we don’t know) vaccinated moms having compromised breast milk, it turns out that Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Mark Zuckerberg have all invested in a startup called ""BioMilq” — which produces lab grown breast milk from mammary cells. \[[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/biomilq-raises-3point5-million-from-bill-gates-investment-firm.html\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/biomilq-raises-3point5-million-from-bill-gates-investment-firm.html]). Reports of this startup include this Frankenstein-like language *as if this is normal*: “The BIOMILQ team creates its product from cells taken from human breast tissue and milk, donated by women in the local community, who get a Target giftcard in return.” \[[https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/business/lab-grown-human-milk-biomilq-health-climate-hnk-spc-intl/index.html\]](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/business/lab-grown-human-milk-biomilq-health-climate-hnk-spc-intl/index.html])

As if all of this is not horrific enough, Ms Hecht drew studies from three countries — Canada, Scotland and now Israel - -to show that babies are dying disproportionately, during and after 2021, in highly vaccinated countries, and that newborns are dying disproportionately if they have vaccinated mothers versus unvaccinated mothers.

In highly vaccinated Scotland, almost twice the number of babies died in 2021 as died in baseline numbers. \[[https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19726487.investigation-launched-abnormal-spike-newborn-baby-deaths-scotland/\]](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19726487.investigation-launched-abnormal-spike-newborn-baby-deaths-scotland/]). In Ontario, Canada, 86 babies died in 2021, versus a baseline of four or five; this was a baby die-off so severe that a brave Parliamentarian brought the issue to Parliament. \[[https://nonvenipacem.com/2021/12/10/explosive-rise-in-ontario-stillbirths-triggers-parliamentary-questions/\]](https://nonvenipacem.com/2021/12/10/explosive-rise-in-ontario-stillbirths-triggers-parliamentary-questions/]).

In Israel, at RamBam Hospital in Haifa, there were 34% more spontaneous abortions and stillbirths to vaccinated women as to unvaccinated women.

Ms Hecht also notes that menstrual dysregulation in vaccinated women is fully confirmed now by many studies, with an average of one extra day of bleeding a month (a side effect about which I warned about in March of 2021, which in turn got me called names by a CNN commentator and permanently deplatformed from Twitter).

You don’t have to know more than eighth grade biology to know that a dysregulated menstrual cycle, not to mention spike protein accumulating in the ovaries, not to mention the traversing of the bodies’ membranes, including the amniotic sac, by tiny hard fatty lipid nanoparticles, not to mention PEG in breast milk, is all going to affect fertility, fetal health, childbirth, and babies’ GI wellbeing or distress, and thus their ability or failure to thrive (let alone bond).

And now, the babies are dying. Now scale the data from Canada, Scotland and Israel to all the vaccinated nations in the world.

What do we do with all of this?

Knowing as I now do, that Pfizer and the FDA knew that babies were dying and mothers’ milk discoloring by just looking at their own internal records; knowing as I do that they did not alert anyone let alone stop what they were doing, and that to this day Pfizer, the FDA and other demonic “public health” entities are pushing to MRNA-vaccinate more and more pregnant women; now that they are about to force this on women in Africa and other lower income nations who are not seeking the MRNA vaccines, per Pfizer CEO Bourla this past week at the WEF, and knowing that Pfizer is pushing and may even receive a US EUA for babies to five year olds — I must conclude that we are looking into an abyss of evil not see since 1945.

So I don’t know about you, but I must switch gears with this kind of unspeakable knowledge to another kind of discourse.

I am not saying that this is exactly like finding evidence of Dr Mengele’s experiments, a comparison that has been excessive in the recent past; but I am saying, with these findings, that now the comparison may not be that excessive. These demons at Pfizer, speaking at the WEF; these demons at the FDA; knowing what they know; are targeting the miraculous female body, with its ability to conceive, gestate, birth and nurture life. They are targeting the female body’s ability to sustain a newborn human being with nothing but itself. They are targeting the amniotic membrane, the ovaries that release the ovum, they are targeting the lymph and blood that help support the building up of mother’s milk, they are targeting the fetus in utero, helpless.

They are targeting the human fetus’ very environment, one of the most sacred spaces on this earth, if not the most sacred.

*And they know it.*

I don’t know about you, and I am not proselytizing, but as you may know if you read me here, these apocalyptic days, I turn to prayer. I have started to say in public, once I had to face the fact of the die-off of the babies, that this is a Biblical time; and I mean Old Testament Biblical.

It is a time like the times that saw the construction of the Tower of Babel — a time of massive human arrogance against divine plans; a time when men such Bill Gates tamper with and seek to outdo God’s best works in lab after lab, and a time of Tech Bros “disrupting” the human competition for their unsought-after goods and services, by targeting human processes and by ruining the human bodies made in the image of God.

It is a time of plagues like the ten plagues that assailed the Egyptians in Exodus 11:4-6:

**“4** So Moses said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.**5** Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. **6** There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. **7”**

This was the worst plague of all, the slaying of the firstborn.

It is a time of *ha-Satan* — Satan — “going to and fro in the earth, and \[…\] walking up and down in it”, as Job 2 describes him; *ha-Satan* having his way with us.

It is a time of demons sauntering around in human spaces, though they are demons who sit looking human enough themselves, smug and smiling in their Italian suits on panels at the World Economic Forum.

*Ha-Satan* \- and his armies: ruining the conception, the milk, the menses, the touch, the cradling of the infant by its mother, ruining the feeding of the infant; ruining the babies themselves.

I read the Prophets a lot these days — because how could I not? I am looking for what writer Annie Lamott called “Operating Instructions.” What do you do when humanity itself is threatened? When there are professional battalions and bureaucratic departments of people who act like demons, acting with anathema toward the human race?

Surely there must be a clue.

So I pay attention to other times in our Western story, when humans were faced with a genocide. I reread the story of Noah, and the Book of Esther, a lot these days; I reread Jeremiah.

We’ve been here before. Embarrassingly often, when it comes to that.

The story is always the same, at least in the Hebrew Bible (in the New Testament, of course, God skips to the end and upends the plot).

At least in the Hebrew Bible, God is always trying to get our attention, always, it seems, simply asking us just to walk alongside him; simply asking us to keep his not--too-challenging commandments; not, indeed, asking a lot.

**Jeremiah 1:13:**

**“** The word of the Lord came to me again: “What do you see?”

“I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”

**14** The Lord said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. **15** I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the Lord.

“Their kings will come and set up their thrones    in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem;they will come against all her surrounding walls    and against all the towns of Judah.**16** I will pronounce my judgments on my people    because of their wickedness in forsaking me,in burning incense to other gods    and in worshiping what their hands have made.”

In the Hebrew Bible, anyway, the math is simple. We turn, we listen, and we are saved; or we carry on heedlessly, worshipping what our own hands have made, sluts to other gods — to “the science,” to media lies, to the narcissism of convention, these days, one might say — and thus we are lost.

We have been nearly lost, time after time after time.

This time could really be the last time; these monsters in the labs, these demons on the transnational panels, are so very skillful; and so powerful; and their dark work is so extensive.

If God is there — again — after all the times that we have tried his patience — and who indeed knows? Will we reach out a hand to him in return, take hold in the last moment out of this abyss, and simply find a way somehow to walk alongside him?

Or will we this time, in losing the babies, and heedlessly carrying on nonetheless — be — truly lost?

88,Uncle Ted Kaczynski Warned Us Over 30yrs Ago...,421.0,tqq1r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/tqq1r9/uncle_ted_kaczynski_warned_us_over_30yrs_ago/,115.0,1648522355.0,"**Was Uncle Ted Right?**

First off, a disclaimer. I'm all for the battle of ideas. We are in a battle for the mind, I'm in no way in favor of physical altercations and or ""taking the law into my own hands."" I've read a majority of Ted's work and agree with most of his philosophy. I will show you in his own words, the things that he foresaw and warned us about. He obviously gets a bad rap, when you kill people for your beliefs that usually happens. What if you take your beliefs very seriously, to the point that it's - a matter of life and death? That is what Ted did, he knew he would get the attention of his collogues, news reporters, and his local representatives. Many documentaries will paint him as a ""domestic terrorist"" or ""insane"" - did he know something that we didn't, did he try to kill those who were studying technology that is taking effect all around us today? Yes, what he tried doing was raise enough awareness to start a revolution against the - modern technologic society, which is the bi-product of the - Industrial Revolution. 

>*""The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive, or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden, or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society."" par. 1-4)*

He states it ""may or may not make use of violence."" He is writing plural as - FC (Freedom Club), he clearly took the violence approach. Did this drastic measure work? Yes, unfortunately and fortunately it succeeded. He stated he would quit the bombings if the - News would publish his ""manifesto"" they did - and as a bi-product his brother recognized the rhetoric and writing style and eventually reported it to the FBI. The conspiracy surrounding Ted, is - he was once part of a Harvard experiment on psychological control subsidized by the CIA. This is now known as [MK Ultra](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3600988580624732240/4577107915976362942#). His brother and most viewers of documentaries will attribute his attacks, as him being - insane, because of the experiments. This doesn't hold true; Ted was out of the program and went to be a professor at the University of Michigan later on in life. I believe he saw the technology at that time as an ""evil"" process, or an intrusive way of inflicting serious damage on the planet. I believe he ""woke up"" or was ""red-pilled"" and finally had enough and truly felt he had to take drastic measures. Here are some of his foresights into the future and you decide if he was right.

>*""Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented, and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology."" par. 6-7)*

He describes numerous times in his work of the Left and their obvious threat to society. By stating *""They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality.""* Sounds about right doesn't it. Seems he is a far-right sympathizer or even a MAGA supporter. He would go even further by uncovering the psychic trope of the radical left. He makes the point of their hypocrisy for social-justice and race relations. How they abuse altruism to gain power over others.

>*""Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the over-socialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism... But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss."" par. 21-22)*

It is a fact that ""progressives"" are more susceptible to not only to become radicalized but also to be a benefit to the system. Unbeknownst to them, the Left actually help aid the system - which ensures its survival - which in turn encapsulates us more into enslavement. It is the Left, which on the true political spectrum, harbor all authoritarianism and totalitarianism. But, make no mistake he also calls out the Conservatives for their lack of observation on the issue of rapid modern tech progression.

>*""The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently, it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values"" par. 50)*

He sees the abyss that we face and have been facing. This progress will lead to more and more mental issues, lack of purpose, and less freedom. Ted writes that the mental problems of the radical Left are a problem for society as a whole. That low self-esteem, depression, anxiety and defeatism. Looking at our society, these mental issues are more common the more technology our society surrounds itself with. The loss of freedom and individuality is losing ground and becoming saturated with *""We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.""* With the rise in mental problems, it's obvious this gives a reason for the rise of experts impeding in our way of life. This is why we need medication for nearly everything. Teds reasoning was a need for humans (biologically) to have power or control over nature, but not entirely the need of power, just the lack of goals and the complement of said goals. With technology ""helping"" us with everything, this in turn blocks and restricts us of this term he called the ""Power Process."" The elements of the power process are - Goal, Effort, and Attainment of goal.

>*""Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression. Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals... In modern industrial society only, minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one’s physical needs. It is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus, it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities...*  *We suggest that modern man’s obsession with longevity, and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process. The “mid-life crisis” also is such a symptom. So is the lack of interest in having children that is fairly common in modern society but almost unheard-of in primitive societies."" par. 35-40,74)*

I read all the time that - [depression and anxiety are on the rise.](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3600988580624732240/4577107915976362942#) The media and experts will blame - C19 of course. But statistic show that these mental problems have been increasing steadily since the - Industrial Revolution. Many of our mental problems are a biproduct of this technological system. Humans are not designed to have phones, tv's, computers, and information shoved in their faces and brains 24/7 365. This is in fact a problem one that is termed - [infoglut](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3600988580624732240/4577107915976362942#) meaning - information overload, think gluttony on information. A very interesting take on mental problems along side of technological progress is the book by Jeff Sconce entitled: [The Technical Delusion](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3600988580624732240/4577107915976362942#). Here he writes on this problem of information overload and increased of nervousness(anxiety) due to future shock(rapid advancement of tech) in modern times.

>*“George Beard’s dissection of “American nervousness” and Sigmund Freud’s “principle of constancy” also spoke to a nervous system struggling to accommodate proliferating sources of stimulation. This theme continued throughout the twentieth century, as well. In 1970, Alvin Toffler described “future shock” as “the shattering stress and disorientation that we On the Spectrums* *induce in individuals by subjecting them to too much change in too short a time,” a shift measured in large part by new strategies for processing information. One of the definitions of sanity is the ability to tell real from unreal,” Toffler observed. “Soon we’ll need a new definition.” Mark Andrejevic describes this new environment as “infoglut,” arguing that the multiplication of media and information in the digital era produces a troubling paradox in everyday life. “At the very moment when we have the technology to inform ourselves as never before,” he writes, “we are simultaneously and compellingly confronted with the impossibility of ever being fully informed. Even more disturbingly, we are confronted with this impossibility at the very moment when we are told that being informed is more important than ever before to our livelihood, our security, our social lives."" pgs. 16-17)*

Interesting note there, that we are *""...confronted with the impossibility of ever being fully informed.""* We won't ever be, that is the problem. We must be genetically modified. Humans have to embrace the next level of the evolved state, which is - Homo Deus. In fact, this is why the need for - Biotechnology. Humans are not compatible with the future TPTB want to encircle us with. Ted realizing this in his time writes about not only that we aren't compatible but why.

>*""We attribute the social and psychological problem of modern society to the fact that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions...* *For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. In the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. Thus there is no stable framework... We argue, is that modern man has the sense (largely justified) that change is IMPOSED on him, whereas the 19th century frontiersman had the sense (also largely justified) that he created change himself, by his own choice. Thus a pioneer settled on a piece of land of his own choosing and made it into a farm through his own effort."" par. 46-57)*

We today have an immense lack of direction and purpose. We try filling it with anything that triggers - Dopamine. Yes, we have become dopamine addicts. Nearly every person on this realm is an addict and we are addicted to dopamine. What do we do to fill this void? We watch tell-a-vision to escape reality, live vicariously in videogames, masturbate to pornography, and live our alternative lives in social media. These objects of our attention have become our elixir of status and self-esteem. Why are, Pov cameras in porn and RPG's/MMO's in video games the most popular fixations of escape? Because it takes you out of this present realm and places you in another more desirable form of existence. Why does it seem that nostalgia and retro anything, have exploded in popularity? Nostalgia seems to be one way that people cope with various negative mental states, or “psychological threats.” If you’re feeling lonely, if you’re feeling like a failure, if you feel like you don’t know if your life has any purpose, or if what you’re doing has any value, you can reach into this reservoir of nostalgic memories and comfort yourself. Nostalgia is a psychological resource that people can dip into to conjure up evidence that they need to assure themselves that they’re valued. All of this will increase the deeper we get into progress. 

>*""...The system HAS TO regulate human behavior closely in order to function. At work people have to do what they are told to do, otherwise production would be thrown into chaos. Bureaucracies HAVE TO be run according to rigid rules. To allow any substantial personal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion. It is true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated, but GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of our lives by large organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrial-technological society. The result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person. It may be, however, that formal regulations will tend increasingly to be replaced by psychological tools that make us want to do what the system requires of us. (Propaganda \[14\], educational techniques, “mental health” programs...  There is no conceivable way to remedy this in a technologically advanced society. The system tries to “solve” this problem by using propaganda to make people WANT the decisions that have been made for them, but even if this “solution” were completely successful in making people feel better, it would be demeaning.* *par. 114,117)*

Now ask - Was Ted, right in his drastic actions? He prophetically writes as a modern-day philosophical sage. With an awareness like writers and thinkers of classical and the middle-ages. I propose it is because of his oneness with nature(God) and his deep awareness of self. Ted also wrote on Gene-modifying which other than personal freedoms and governmental surveillances was, as he saw, the biggest affair and issue for modern man.

>*The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system... But the system, for good, solid, practical reasons, must exert constant pressure on people to mold their behavior to the needs of the system... The only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic engineering of human beings, so that man in the future will no longer be a creation of nature, or of chance, or of God (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product... If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW, just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your children. Such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about “medical ethics.” But a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were “ethical” and others were not, so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an “ethical” use of genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. No code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and mental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today’s world). Inevitably, genetic engineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial- technological system...* *Yet, as we explained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together have created a world in which the average man’s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in those of politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence. \[21\] The same process will continue in the future. Take genetic engineering, for example. Few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease. It does no apparent harm and prevents much suffering. Yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free creation of chance (or of God, or whatever, depending on your religious beliefs)... Thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies. People could be pushed only so far and no farther. But today this may be changing, because modern technology is developing ways of modifying human beings. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society. It is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades. We believe that this is due to disruption of the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76. But even if we are wrong, the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of SOME conditions that exist in today’s society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual’s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable. par. 119,122-124,128,144-145)*

Uncle Ted taught us a lot; he was on top of all our current social issues. He supposedly has cancer. Will you be the new torchbearers? Ted made his warnings clear, and he was very, very serious. Maybe the MK Ultra program instead of ""programming"" him it ""de-programmed"" him and essentially awoke within him the ultimate truth, or the ultimate form of motivation against the system. The only other person I can think of at this moment remotely close to his seriousness was - Bill Cooper.

This is the same sub that supported Assange (whatever his faults, which I am sure were not a few), and for exposing the deep state. 

Trump (whose faults are many), take him for what he is, was NOT supposed to get elected. It was supposed to be Hillary. That is what the emails were about (notice the story has been changed from what was in the emails, to how they were leaked). As Sec. of State, Hillary made a lot of sketchy and illegal deals and favors for foreign clients (including-surprise surprise: Russia!) that she was supposed to fulfill after she got elected. She didn't, and everything has gone to hell since then. As a defensive measure, she had to project her lawlessness and crimes on Trump, just like her family projected their malice and of sexual assault victims onto him.

Assange was instrumental, through the leaks (NOT hacks) that he revealed to the world in Hillary's downfall. That is why they are trying so hard to get him (and Trump).

And about Russia: guess what? They are in a MUCH worse position now with Trump in office than Hillary. That is because, despite Trump's initial desire to not engage in foreign entanglements like Syria and make peace and deals with Russia, they have been rendered completely unable to work with him in this climate of anti-Russian hysteria. They could have done much better under Hillary with the aforementioned deals they had with her.

The disagreements these elected officials tend to have are more based on aesthetics than actual policy differences. 

Both parties are center right on the economic axis. 

Both parties are perfectly willing to use state violence to limit your freedom of speech - the Republicans are just open about it, and the Democrats will go for a photo op in traditional African garb and then say they're going to increase the police budget. 

Both parties are dedicated to meddling in foreign affairs and are heavily funded by the military-industrial complex.

The Democrats may put on a bit of political theater when the military budget comes up, but when push comes to shove, they always agree to huge budget increases.

When it comes to climate change, Republicans have opted to embrace the anti-science position espoused by many of their voters, whereas Democrats will pay lip service to climate science, and then refuse to implement the necessary legislation to prevent climate catastrophe.

The guy with the red tie cares about you as much as the guy with the blue tie does - not at all.

The South Atlantic Magnetic Field Anomaly (SAMFA) is a mega monster magnetic field hole that stretches from South America all the way to South Africa. The magnetic field in that massive area is so weak that satellites have to powered off for their own safety.

SMAFA is moving west 12 mile per year and is starting to split into two. This is extremely important because solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and humans. Scientists are obviously told to downplay the danger. 20 million people live right under the hole in the city of Sao Paulo.

Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc)  \- YT 6 min - Best part starts at 2:45

Scientists and policymakers don't want you to know that magnetic pole shifts can happen in as little time as a hundred years. It can take up to a thousands years too. When this occurs, the earth can have as many as 5 magnetic poles slowly moving around the planet. Exposure to solar/space radiation is increased under these poles which can take up to a decade to pass overhead. Solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and animals.

I believe that the SAMFA splitting into two is the beginning of the multi-polar phenomena. Policymakers prohibit discussion of it by scientists due to fear, panic, money etc. - the usual suspects. It's why you don't know so many things that are extremely important to your well being.

At the same time that the SAMFA gets weaker, we are also losing mid latitude lower stratospheric ozone, which together with the magnetic field, also protects us from the sun. Again policymakers do not want you to know this, that's why there's been a rash of ""Ozone Hole Healing"" articles in recent months.

This is due to scientific academic fraud. The chemicals that were burning a hole in the ozone have not gone away, they are being smuggled as a matter of routine out of China into the US and Europe. The chemicals that replace them are hardly any better. Air conditioning demand is so big that it will use up all our renewable energy power by 2050.

The reason this is happening is because of construction fraud. China has built more city blocks in 10 years than America ever did in its whole history. They pour more cement in 3 years than America ever did in 300 years. Substandard material construction fraud is rampant because cement requires a special sand that is quickly running out. Desert sand won't do. So what do we do? We lie about what sand we are using, that's why new condos in Australia and Canada will only last 25 years instead of 50, it's also why new condos are falling apart in Australia.

Do you remember when Volkswagen was caught doing emissions fraud? Turns out it wasn't just them. Fraud in the safety of products and processes are prevalent in the market. This means that fraud is rampant in the control of social media.

The control of social media, and the minds of millions of kids, is paramount to our unending desire to get rich destroying earth. Both capitalism and socialism are based on plenty. Everything you think you know is 100 years old.

We have to stop burning 50% of fuel in 10 years. Scientists are not allowed to say that. They are told they must say, we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. They get paid by tax dollars so they do what they're told.  This is probably one of the last places I'm not banned, and even where I am not banned, these ideas are fought against tooth and nail by young people.

##Oswald Worked Directly for Robert F. Kennedy Who Authorized His Return from the USSR to Conduct Domestic ‘Counterintelligence’

>The following narrative concerning the true role of Lee Harvey Oswald in the assassination of John F. Kennedy is both simple and complex.  

>Simple because Oswald was actually a very young and simple guy who was grossly misrepresented by the government, law enforcement and the media. Complex because an extraordinary confluence of circumstances threw him into a literal caldron of festering conflicts and complicated vendettas.

>“No good deed goes unpunished” is an adage that is quite applicable to the real story of Lee Oswald. His idealistic nature and ardent search for his mission in life propelled him into the most dangerous game on the planet in the early 1960s.  

>Such was his naiveté and quixotic approach to life that Oswald would be thrust onto a battlefield that guaranteed he would be caught in the crossfire. And so he was on November 24th, 1963.

>Whatever you have heard about Lee Harvey Oswald has most likely originated with the ultra-secret CIA Assassination Team which oversaw every aspect of President Kennedy’s assassination.  

>More accurately, it was their Langley-based propaganda arm, as well as numerous organs of disinformation that were responsible for the entire JFK assassination coverup. Therefore, it is imperative to suspend any and all judgment concerning Lee Harvey Oswald (LHO) while reading this authoritative account.  

>The evidence and testimony in this exposé is as factual as it is credible and provides a penetrating insight into the modus operandi of the typical CIA assassination and/or false flag operation.

[JFK Assassination: Classic CIA Execution Plan | The Millennium Report](http://themillenniumreport.com/2014/11/jfk-assassination-classic-cia-execution-plan/)

>All of these new details surrounding the true relationship between and among John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald have been corroborated as much as possible at this late date.  

>Thanks to the internet, there is now a wealth of information and data available concerning both the assassination and the coverup.  Events and meetings have been verified via the public record. Dates and times have been authenticated with actual news reports. Key individuals have been identified by firsthand accounts, as their accomplices have been confirmed. Critical relationships and conspiratorial collaborations have likewise been substantiated.

>In the end, Lee Harvey Oswald will be known as the unsung hero who was quite meticulously framed by the CIA, the FBI and the Dallas Police Department. Framed because he was known by the CIA to be working very closely with the Kennedy brothers. 

>John Kennedy was well known for his dissatisfaction with the CIA’s incorrigible abuse of power and numerous rogue elements. Both he and Robert were intent on eliminating all the black operations conducted by the CIA in collaboration with the Mafia and Cuban exiles who wanted Fidel Castro dead. Particularly after the Bay of Pigs fiasco was JFK determined to rein in the CIA, if not shut it down altogether.

>The ensuing, unparalleled intra-governmental feud was going on at the same time that Bobby Kennedy had declared war on organized crime, especially the Italian mafia families in New York City, Chicago and New Orleans.  

>After singling out the Mafia for an unprecedented spate of federal prosecutions, the Italian-American mafioso Carlos Marcello – ”Godfather” of the New Orleans Mafia — became a special target of the Justice Department. 

>Because of the CIA’s direct collusion with this Louisiana mob figure and a NOLA clique of Cuban exiles in their attempts to overthrow the Castro regime was Oswald assigned by RFK to infiltrate that totally rogue operation. The last thing the Kennedy brothers wanted to be associated with was the unlawful assassination of another head of state — Fidel Castro.

>Toward that end Oswald’s deep cover status was fiercely protected throughout the Attorney General-run sting against the anti-Castro movement which was growing more volatile by the day. The failed assassination attempts on Castro’s life only seemed to increase the fervor of so many Cuban exiles who wanted their country back no matter how.  

>Some of the more fanatical were contracted by the CIA to perform as hit men and to do any other dirty work that The Company (also known as the CIA) did not want to be directly affiliated with.

##New Orleans: Where Rogue CIA Operatives, Fanatical Cuban Exiles, and Revengeful Louisiana Mafia Intersect

>This specific inter-party dynamic and the collaboration among these three groups is crucial to understand. They all had the same goal in mind: To take back Cuba. After all, Havana had become a veritable oasis for the international set of glitterati, gamblers and gunrunners.  When Castro finally took over Cuba in 1959 he ended the party of all parties.  

>Cuba was fast becoming the major link in the burgeoning international illegal drug trade. When he turned off the lights in the famous Havana casinos, he also terminated the illegal drug trafficking which then closed down the highly profitable Cuban market.

>1959 was not a good year in Cuba for those who saw their casinos shuddered, their drug and prostitution rings broken up, their loansharking operations and protection rackets closed down, and their gunrunning terminated.  

>A capitalist ‘dream’ turned into a communist ‘nightmare’ with the guerrilla revolution that overthrew the exceedingly corrupt regime of Fulgencio Battista. The very nexus of all these dubious activities — transnational illegal drug trafficking — was the core business that the CIA, the Cubans, and the Mafia shared.  

>So profitable were their respective shares of the drug revenues that they were willing to anything — ANYTHING — to get it all back.

>For the diehard Cuban capitalist, facing Castro’s firing squads was completely out of the question; hence, many an exile showed up in Miami and New Orleans, the two major hubs for the fleeing Havana exiles.  

>New Orleans, however, became the magnet for those fanatics who would participate in any plot whatsoever that would allow them to reclaim their former piece of Cuban paradise.  

>What united them more than anything was their hatred for Fidel Castro. When the Kennedy Administration withdrew their support for this cause, the Cuban exiles redirected their intense hatred toward the President, as did the involved Mafia families and many rogue elements within the CIA.

>Come the fall of 1963, these animosities had been festering for years and looking for an outlet. All three parties — the CIA, the Cuban exiles, and the Mafia — shared the same agenda and had conveniently overlapping goals.  

>Each of them felt betrayed by the Kennedy’s after the Bay of Pigs debacle, although the Administration felt they had been betrayed by the CIA and the Joint Chiefs.  

>Nevertheless, President Kennedy fell squarely within their crosshairs that November. All the pent up rage was quite purposefully channelled toward JFK’s demise…by those ‘stakeholders’ who truly controlled the realm.

>[This photograph was taken in a nightclub in Mexico City on 22nd January, 1963.](http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barry-MexCity63-HiRez.jpg)

>All of the men in the photograph are members of Operation 40, a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored undercover operation in the early 1960s. 

>The group was initially formed to seize political control of Cuba after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. It’s primary function included an ultra-secret CIA assassination team that was mobilized to execute heads of state, politicians, military officers, etc. in nations identified for regime change.

##The ‘Cuban Angst’ Context Is What Compelled Bobby Kennedy to Employ Lee Harvey Oswald

>Robert F. Kennedy knew that multiple plots were afoot to bring them down. Where his older brother John (by 8 years) had managed to live through World War II and seen the horrors of war, Bobby had not.  Whereas JFK was known to have some very serious medical conditions that required regular monitoring, Bobby was young and healthy. 

>He, too, had aspirations of being president one day, after a successful stint as Attorney General within the wildly popular Kennedy Administration. Therefore, his instincts for self preservation were greatly sharpened, unlike JFK who knew he could take the hit at anytime.

>As Attorney General, Bobby was much more aware of the scuttlebutt on the street, especially on the streets of New Orleans and Miami. He was also privy to much inside information from his “eyes and ears” within the organized anti-Castro movement.  

>The investigative apparatus of the Justice Department also provided him with massive amounts of privileged information, especially in regard to Jack’s pet project — exposing illegal CIA-sponsored anti-Castro activities. For it was this particular pretext that JFK would use to forever shut down the CIA.

>Allen Dulles, the first civilian Director of the CIA, was deeply involved in regime change around the globe. After the failed Bay of Pigs operation, regime change in Cuba became much more unlikely, as history has shown.

""In autumn 1961, following the Bay of Pigs incident, Dulles and his entourage, including Deputy Director for Plans Richard M. Bissell, Jr. and Deputy Director Charles Cabell, were forced to resign.""  

>The firing of Allen Dulles proved to be the most consequential act by President Kennedy as it greatly fueled the “Cuban Angst” problem.

>There is another very significant backstory to the burgeoning anti-Castro movement that revolves around heavyweights like George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, Allen Dulles, J. Edgar Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson and some very powerful conservative businessmen.  

>There’s no question that these high profile political powerhouses were being pushed by their corporate overlords to undo the Cuban revolution. 

>Not only did they not want a communist state in their back yard, they didn’t want their myriad commercial interests threatened throughout Central and South America. The specter of industry-wide nationalizations was already looming in various left-leaning countries.

>Rogue elements within the CIA, fanatical Cuban exiles, avaricious NOLA mafioso and the like were merely the tools in this raging war between capitalism and communism. Their collective hatred — and deep-rooted fear — of Communism became the central organizing principle for a virtual conglomerate of various government institutions and corporate entities.  

>Castro’s Cuba was regarded as anathema to this burgeoning movement.  The Kennedys and Kings were simply no match during the tumultuous 1960s.  

>History was overwhelmingly on the side of the warmongers, not the peacemakers, as the shocking succession of tragic assassinations during the 60s demonstrated.

>Come 1963, two years after the Bay of Pigs, the frustration and anger was to reach a boiling point. All the money and resources, time and energy, personnel and training that were marshaled toward assassinating Fidel Castro were simply redirected toward assassinating President Kennedy.  

>Even the assassination training camps owned by Mike McLaney in Lacombe, Louisiana were teeming with angry Cuban exiles, mafia hit men and rogue CIA agents. Trigger-happy is the only way to describe the combustible atmosphere, and the Kennedys became the target.

>For these, and other reasons, Bobby Kennedy chose Lee Harvey Oswald — as an ultra-secret, supra-classified counterintelligence asset to infiltrate the CIA-Cuban-Mafia movement.  

>In that capacity, Oswald literally functioned as a one-man domestic counterintelligence operation. Because he was born in New Orleans he knew well the lay of the land there. He also lived in Dallas upon his return from the USSR since his mother and brother had moved there.  

>However, it was his lifelong affinity to socialism and communism which made him a natural fit for the mission that RFK had in mind.

>Because Oswald had a longstanding interest in communism, he defected to the USSR at a very young age just before turning 20.  This extraordinary initiative alone demonstrated his unusual courage and commitment to act on his convictions.  

>Certainly, to proceed with that major move, especially given the “Red Scare” political climate of the 1950s, was to go against the grain in a most countercultural way.  Therefore, RFK knew he had an extremely unique character in the person of Oswald, someone who was brave enough to walk into the fire pit of the New Orleans-based, CIA-controlled, anti-Castro movement.  

>He also knew that Oswald could be trusted in a way that no one else could be. In other words, Lee Harvey Oswald was willing to sacrifice his life for a much higher purpose. And so he did!

I'll also make it clear to the shills why this post belongs in this subreddit.,364.0,wb44xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wb44xa/i_made_a_post_yesterday_about_trump_and_the/,895.0,1659099467.0,"1. People were really offensive. That i was brainless, i sucked Trump's balls etc. There were hundreds of comments like this. First of all I wanna make clear something and I know that there are lots of people like me. I don't think that Trump is a politician. He barely was in politics for 4 years. All of these 4 years, he was attacked by MSM, corporations, POLITICIANS of BOTH sides, not just democrats, but also from his republican party. I understand very well that both parties are the wings of the same bird. It's just that I don't think Trump is part of them cause if it wasn't for him, I would never understand how corrupt American politicians are, how corrupt the media is (yes left and right), and would've taken 4 shots and kept 2 masks and would take for granted everything that msm said (sadly I believed the msm, until 2020). I would not understand how the climate thing is a hoax (maybe not in it's entirity), and I would be walking undisturbed towards the great reset. So I give credit to him and other people like him that made me realize lots of things that otherwise I would not understand. I have no interest in sucking Trumps balls, because I don't profit anything by writing good words for him. And to all of the offensive comments I wanna tell only 1 thing ""You showed yourself who you really are. If someone likes someone for doing and exposing something, it's his personal decision and freedom of speech. Don't be negative. If you wanna debate, do it in a civilized way. Bad words just show how poorly your families raised you. This was for the real people. For bots and paid shills I don't have anything to say.
2. I don't idolize Trump. I like him as a person who tried to change something in US. The fact that during his administration lots of good things happened and less of bad things happened, the fact that he exposed the MSM always as fake news (which is true), the fact that he exposed Big Pharma, the fact that went against his ""medical advisors"" like Fauci and Birx etc, made me like him and follow what he said.
3. The fact that he got the boot from the social media because of things he said, and how everything against him stood up in the social media and things pro him got banned, made me like him.
4. About Epstein. Yes, he was friends with him, but as most of you know, he banned him from Mar a Lago, and this was before he was president.
5. I formulated the wrong sentence when I wrote ""there was no covid or things like this"". What I meant was that we were OK and happy with him in power. No problems for 3 years straight. Economy was good. Employment rate was good. Employment of black people was very high. Citizens loved him for this.
6. The fact that the left wing media in these 2 years lost viewers, lost followers on social media, and the conservative media gained a lot of these viewers and followers (often being in synchron with YOU people here in this subreddit that made lots of quality posts), make me believe that the MAJORITY of Americans love Trump. This is not the only indicator of course (and it may even be an irrelevant one), there are lots of other indicators.
7. In my country in Europe, I know very well that politicians were against him. Yeah, the same politicians that made us wear masks and ordered the police to check us if we had the shots and our masks etc. Also, there were some interesting things that my country interfered in the US elections. How...idk. Do I believe this... yes and no for different reasons.
8. He was against mandates. Against shots. Pro 2nd amendment. Pro first amendment. No one was banned for speaking their mind during his Presidency. In 2020 and 2021 and 2022, lots of people were banned that thought like him or liked him. Happened to me too.
9. About the conspiracy, I believe election was stolen for 2 reasons. 1 because he gave the WEF the middle finger in Davos in 2020 (watch his speech on YT if you havent) and immediately after the rona was released. With the releasing of rona the intent was for people not to go in person and vote. That's why he continuingly told the people during his campaign to go and vote en masse. Because it would be much more difficult for the deepstate to cheat. They had to cheat A LOT, in order to defeat Trump. That's why he got 81 million votes (if i recall correctly), more than any incumbent President in history, but Joe broke records...yeah..Joe broke records... The 2nd reason is because that if he stayed 4 more years, after exposing the swamp in his first term, I believe he would keep his word to drain it. The swamp could not allow this cause they would use their miraculous vaccines on people and brainwash them and all the problems from the vaccine, would not exist at all. This brings me to my final point...
10. A lot of you said that he allowed operation warp speed. Yes, I agree with you totally and I was appalled at first. But later I realized that in order for states to reopen (at least the dem ones, cause the others opened much much earlier) and for the economy to regain it's shape , a solution was needed. A solution that even the DS could not counter. Vaccines. But the most important part was that a) he didn't develop the vaccines. b) He NEVER told people to take the vaccine forcibly or to wear masks. He let it in people hands.

So I think the conspiracy is clear. Invite him in Davos 2020 thinking to make him your ""friend"". If yes, continue with the plan. If no, release the rona. Disrupt the election. Bring down the strongest point of his presidency, the economy, install a puppet, do lots of bad things in USA and around the world, and in the end the puppet would be blamed, probably removed with the 25th amendment (or any other method), install another puppet that will do bad things.

If you wanna comment or ask questions to me, please be civilized. I may be wrong and I would like to be proven wrong, even though I think that what I wrote makes sense. Despised him until 2020 (because the msm told me so) and liked him after 2020. This is my opinion.
Edit: For those who don't know who was against him 4 years ago.

110,Unvaccinated Single Women Say 'No' To Vaccinated Single Men,363.0,ydxbeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ydxbeo/unvaccinated_single_women_say_no_to_vaccinated/,388.0,1666788549.0,"**by** [**Laura J. Wellington**](https://www.americanthinker.com/author/laurajwellington/)

Ask any single woman about the ease of dating in today’s world and they will most certainly roll their eyes and groan. As a single woman myself, I can vouch for how tough the dating climate is for every one of us. But unvaccinated, single women now have it that much harder. The reason? The decision as to whether or not they will date vaccinated men is now on the table. And I can tell you first-hand, which has nothing to do with the viability of the candidates, themselves, as rich and interesting prospects, but rather “sex” to put it bluntly.  

The overriding concern that the harmful effects of this vaccine may, ultimately, enter these women once the raincoat comes off.

As these women chose to remain unvaccinated for a reason, mitigating any risk by eliminating candidates based upon vaccine-status has become their new norm. Doing so isn’t without its issues, admittedly. Qualifying single men by such a standard makes the pool in which to select from additionally small, especially if one is living in a blue state. On top of that, plenty of single men don’t shine to the notion that they aren’t being considered simply because they decided to get vaccinated. Among the most disgruntled, hostile men tend to be those who succumbed to the vaccine by force. Feeling penalized twice over for a vaccine they never wanted to begin with, many of these men don’t handle these women’s rejection well.  

Guilt, annoyance, diminishment, and just plain rudeness are known to occur in relation to these women’s decision to stay committed to their particular stance. “I have been called names for stating that the vaccine is a dealbreaker for me,” said Anika Janis.

For these women,[ there is simply not enough information about the vaccine](https://american-viewpoints.simplecast.com/episodes/what-drives-some-women-to-give-up-on-finding-a-partner) or its effects to warrant consideration. No one knows the ramifications or what is to come for those who took the vaccine.

Where men might take being vetoed personally, women don’t see it that way. Women see it as an act of self-preservation and safety in the face of reality, given the nature of a large portion of men presently. Most will not want to keep that raincoat on for longer than absolutely necessary. With this in mind, until much, much more is uncovered about how this vaccine impacts lives, the decision ‘not to date’ vaccinated men remains steadfast for numerous unvaccinated women. 

Although some may see these women’s extreme caution as being foolish, others point to the “intense criticism experienced, extreme pressure imposed by vaccine mandates, and the physical anomalies shared by outspoken vaccinated -- people no longer the picture of health after receiving the vaccine” to validate their decision. For these women, science ‘speaking to the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines’ does little to remove the fear associated with what they are observing all around them simply because “no one knows who to trust anymore” in their opinion. That, in itself, is the only consistent truth these women feel that they can count on.  

And if you think they are alone in this assertion, think again. Plenty of unvaccinated parents agree and are cautioning their teenage and adult children to adopt that same form of thinking when it comes to dating. Single, unvaccinated men are also following suit and running into the same issues as their single, unvaccinated, female counterparts. Calling themselves “Purebloods,” they too are only looking for unvaccinated partners to date. And even unvaccinated, married women have taken a stand with regards to their husbands’ decisions to take the vaccine or not. Several have noted to me that “divorce has been become an option” if their husbands buckled to the pressure of being vaccinated. All in all, the dilemma is resonating strongly across the unvaccinated board, beginning with single women. 

As each person’s health is truly their own responsibility, the stance so many unvaccinated, single women are taking when contemplating future partners holds implications that span everything from ‘lost opportunity’ to ‘potentially moving to red states boasting larger pickings’ to the possibility of ‘remaining alone’ forever. That said, there is also the factor of *time* that may soften their positions. As more information comes out and more is understood, some of them may change their minds. But many say “No,” citing differing vaccination statuses and ‘overall perspectives between vaccinated and unvaccinated’ being just too great. The same holds true for blood transfusions, which they are also avoiding like the plague due to concerns over [“vaccinated” blood](https://www.newsweek.com/blood-centers-say-unvaccinated-people-are-refusing-transfusions-tainted-donations-1620236) being given to them. 

“The Decision to Live. Unfortunately the blood supply is contaminated too, so no blood transfusions,” said Moa Refm.

“It (the vaccine) says a lot about who these men are at the core, including their level of awareness and definition of life,” said Kathy McPherson.

Fear over the exchange of bodily fluids (including saliva) combined with worries about the ramifications of shedding adds a further layer and deterrent beyond mere ejaculation. It isn’t one element alone that screams, “Stop,” rather many woven together -- all of which make complete sense in their particular view.

For now, dating for single, unvaccinated women has just become even more insufferable than before. Who would have ever thought that “vaccine status” would become so central to cultivating new friendships and love relationships for much of our nation? The divide is here to stay because the damage that caused it has already been done. Nothing can put that genie back in its bottle.

12. Miners in Lovelock Cave, California, discovered a very tall, red-haired mummy In 1911  


13. This mummy eventually went to a fraternal lodge where it was used for ""initiation purposes.""  


14. In 1931, skeletons from 8 1-2 to 10 feet long were found in the Humbolt lake bed in California.  


15. In 1932, Ellis Wright found human tracks in the gypsum rock at White Sands, New Mexico. His discovery was later backed up by Fred Arthur, Supervisor of the Lincoln National Park and others who reported that each footprint was 22 inches long and from 8 to 10 inches wide. They were certain the prints were human in origin due to the outline of the perfect prints coupled with a readily apparent instep.  


16. During World War II, author Ivan T. Sanderson tells of how his crew was bulldozing through sedimentary rock when it stumbled upon what appeared to be a graveyard. In it were crania that measured from 22 to 24 inches from base to crown nearly three times as large as an adult human skull. Had the creatures to whom these skulls belonged been properly proportioned, they undoubtedly would have been at least 12 feet tall or taller.  


17. In 1947 a local newspaper reported the discovery of nine-foot-tall skeletons by amateur archeologists working in Death Valley.  


18. The archeologists involved also claimed to have found what appeared to be the bones of tigers and dinosaurs with the human remains.  


19. The Catalina Islands, off California, are the home of dwarf mammoth bones that were once roasted in ancient fire pits. These were roasted and eaten by human-like creatures who were giants with double rows of teeth.  


20. One of the latest accounts of a race of giants that occupied Europe comes from the middle ages and involves a surprising figure: Saint Christopher. While modern stories of St. Christopher simply make him out as an ordinary man, or perhaps a somewhat homely man, those who actually saw him had a different story. According to his peers, he was a giant, belonging to a tribe of dog-headed, cannibalistic giants. Jacques de Voragine in The Golden Legend wrote of St. Christopher:""He was of gigantic stature, had a terrifying mien, was twelve coudees tall.”  


21. A coudee is an antique measurement equal to or larger than the English linear measurement of a foot. According to this ancient account, St. Christopher stood from 12 to 18 feet tall (a fact that has become hidden in or even erased from church history).  


22. While Western icons don't picture St. Christopher as contemporary accounts described him, those of the Eastern churches do. Often the suggestion is seen in historic accounts that St. Christopher was the product of a tryst between a human being and an Anubis (a demon-like creature based on the Greek Anoubis, which came from the Egyptians jackal-headed god who was believed to lead the dead to judgment)

1. In other words, according to the contemporary accounts of his day, St. Christopher was the product of a spiritual being who mated with a human woman. And once again the result of this union was a creature that matches the descriptions of **the Nephilim**.  
**GENESIS 6:4**  


There were GIANTS in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the SONS OF GOD (Fallen Angels) came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

>1.One of the many races of giants.  


&#x200B;

**...AND THEY BUILT STONEHENGE**  
There is ample reasons to believe that the monoliths in Salisbury, England, were not built by either the Druids or normal human beings. When one consider the megaliths proportions, tonnage, and lack of resources in terms of both nature and human; and the lack of technology, the possibility that I am suggesting is not so far-fetched as it may seem.  
1. Not a lot is known about the people who would become known as the Celts. It is known that they migrated across Asia Minor, through northern Europe and into what have become the Celtic countries of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Most accounts of them include references to the giants that were often found among them. The ancient Greek historian Pausanias called them ""the world's tallest people.""  


2. ""Modern historians now believe that, in fact, the giants among the Celts were a ruling class that held control over the indigenous population that formed the majority of the Celtic tribes.  


3. As these 60-some tribes that comprised the Cimbri or Cimmerian peoples traveled across Europe, migrating and taking over areas and later being driven Eastward by other cultures, the name of the people changed. While they were in Asia Minor, they were known as the Gomarian Sacae; this was shortened and modified to become Celtae (meaning ""potent and valiant men"" similar to the ""mighty men"" on the Genesis 6 passage). The Greeks called them Galatai a corruption of Celtae; the Romans further changed this name to become Gauls.  


4. Although the Romans 'would eventually devise methods of defeating these giant warriors, attacking long legs that couldn't be guarded by the massive shields these creatures carried, the blue-eyed, blond giants inspired terror among those facing them in battle for the first time.  


The travels of the giants through the German region also most likely inspired the Teutonic legends of the Aryan race of superhumans (with the early name of ""Cimmerian"" having an obvious resemblance that is probably more than happenstance to Aryan). The Nazi ideal ""superman"" was a blue-eyed, blond giant; this is the exact historic description of the Celtae. DeLoach has also made a good argument that the giants ruling the Celtae may very well have been descendants of the Anakim, the giants the Israelites found in the Promised Land. His argument is based on the Roman poet Virgil's account of the Gauls which describes them:  


“Golden is their hair and golden their garb. They are resplendent in their striped cloaks,and their milk-white necks are circled with gold.”  


5.These distinctive gold necklaces have also been discovered in numerous archeological finds, bolstering Virgil's observations.  


6. This tight gold band around the necks of theCeltae is what ties them to the biblical accounts of the Nephilim. Remembering that the Anakim were one of the tribes that were listed as being giants in the Bible, the clue that links the Celtae to the Nephilim is the Hebrew word which is translated as ""Anakim"" in English: The actual word is Anaqiy, meaning ""a descendent of Anak.""  


7. Now the word translated as ""Anak"" in the English version of the Bible is Anaq and was employed as another term for""Canaanite.""  


8. As noted earlier, this suggests that the culture that ruled much of the Promised Land when the Israelites invaded it was comprised of two classes with the Anakim acting as a ruling elite within a larger human population.  


But there's more. Hebrew names are often based on common words, giving the names special meanings that relate it back to characteristics of the individual or thing being named. The word, Anaq, which was employed to name the Anak, used in other contexts means ""a necklace so tight as to appear to be strangling."" Use of this word suggests that the most noticeable feature of the descendants of Anak was a tight chain about the neck.  


That same feature was the distinguishing characteristic that Virgil chose to remark on when describing the Gauls.  


This leads to an important possibility. The Anakim, or giants that adopted their practices, were pushed out of Canaan by the Israelites, going northward and eventually traveling westward over Europe and, with the passage of several millennia, finally settled in the Celtic nations.

**Their Religious Practices**  


9. If the Anakim and the giants among the Celtae were one and the same people, then it's possible to gain an insight into the religious practices of the Nephilim. While the Bible doesn't reveal much about the religious practices of the Anakim, it does hint at human and infant sacrifices and similar horrors. God ordered the Israelites to kill all the men,women and children in many of the cities taken during the invasion of the land by the Jews.  


10.However, more Is known historically from non-Biblical sources about the religion that the Celtae practiced. Ancient historians had a variety of horrors to tell about the Celtae giants, including the fact that they were homosexuals (another crime which dictated the death penalty under Mosaic law). Athenaeus states that the giants were accustomed to sleeping with not one but two boys. The historian Diodorus also suggested that homosexuality was rampant among the giants when he wrote:  


*“Although their wives are comely, they have very little to do with them, but rage with lust in outlandish fashion for the embraces of males. And the most astonishing thing of all is that they feel no concern for their proper dignity but prostitute to others without a qualm the flower of their bodies; nor do they consider this a disgraceful thing to do, but rather when anyone of them is thus approached and refuses the favor offered him, this they consider an act of dishonor.”*  


These passages also provide important links that help prove the Celtae are Nephilim.   


11. Not surprisingly, the religion that the Celtae practiced was also savage and brutal. This religion has come to be known best for the blood-thirsty priests who led its unspeakable acts, the ""Druids."" The actual practices of this religion have mercifully been lost to our modern age. This came about through the number of conquests of the areas ruled by the Celtae giants by the Romans and later the Norsemen, Normans and Saxons. The spread of Christianity through the region spelled the final death blow for the bloody practices of the Druids, leaving behind only altars designed for human sacrifices and the placement of ""magic"" stone monuments that have recently been discovered to have been carefully aligned with the stars, planets, sun and moon. The Druid religion is currently being revived by New Age and neo-pagan groups worldwide another horrifying fact that suggests another assault against the human race might be in place even as we speak.  


Because Ireland was never successfully invaded by the Romans, it remained the last holdout of the human beings who practiced the religion of the Druids after the last of the Celtae giants had apparently died off. St. Patrick and St. Columcille are generally credited with bringing an end to the pagan practices. (St. Patrick was also credited with driving the snakes from Ireland; one might speculate that these ""snakes"" might have been serpents similar to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. If so, these might have been some sort of fallen angels in the form of reptiles.) There are a few horrific details that have filtered down to us about the Druids' practices, however. One is that these priests not only placed their blessings on human sacrifice, they often performed the rites themselves.  


Julius Caesar wrote:

>*“The Gauls believe the power of the immortal gods can be appeased only if one human life is exchanged for another and they have sacrifices of this kind regularly established by the community. Some of them have enormous images made of wickerwork, the limbs of which they fill with living men; these are set on fire and the men perish, enveloped in the flames. They believe that the gods prefer it if the executed have been caught in the act of theft or armed robbery or some other crime. But when the supply of such victims runs out, they even go to the extent of sacrificing innocent men.”*

12. Diodorus had an even more horrifying story about how the Celtae giants attempted to read the future:

>“They devote to death a human being and plunge a dagger into him in the region above the diaphragm, and when the stricken victim has fallen, they read the future from the manner of his fall and from the twitching of his limbs, as well as from the gushing of the blood, having learned to place confidence in an ancient and long-continued practice of observing such matters.""

The exact religious practices of the Anakim are unknown But suffice it to say that the little that has filtered down to us reflects the extreme wickedness and savagery of the Old Testament accounts of these creatures. That groups around the world are now in the process of reviving the Druid and Egyptian practices also speaks volumes about where many in our own times are headed, and what they are really trying to accomplish by reviving this depraved religion.... things are just not always what they appear to be.

**WHERE ARE THEY NOW?**  
“There were GIANTS in the earth in those days....”  


\[Revelation 9:1\] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.  


\[Revelation 9:2\] And he opened the bottomless pit; ...”  


1. The assertions starts with the burden of proof listed in, “GIANTS I”, based on the following statement, and further proved beyond doubt that there were indeed a number of civilizations that were giants:  
 

**GENESIS 6:2**

That the SONS OF GOD saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose....  
 

**GENESIS 6:4**

There were GIANTS in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the SONS OF GOD (Fallen Angels) came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.  


The standard contention is: is this biblical myth, or is this a historical reality of the past... and today?  


The new challenging assertion set before you is this: where are they now, if they ever really did exist? The answer?....“the inner earth”. And the entrances to this new homeland: one at the extreme northern axis of the earth, the other at the extreme southern axis.  


Throughout history and various cultures, this new homeland has taken on various appellations:

>The Ultimate Thule  
Aggartha  
Shamballa  
Shangri-La  
Elusian Fields  
Asgard  
Atlantis  
Valhalla  
Realm of Jason & the Argonauts, etc.

As fantastic as the assertion sounds, the burden of proof resides in this brief documentation. But to save space, and not to try your patience, I have only chosen select passages from each publications included therein. Nevertheless, let us start from the most ancient documentation, progressing to the more contemporary -  


Your intellectual foundations are about to be challenged... For truth is sometimes much stranger than fiction  
 

**From the “SECRETS OF ENOCH”**  
2. “The men (literally, angels) took me on to the fifth heaven and placed me, and there I saw many and countless soldiers, called Grigori (rebellious angels), of human appearance, and their size was greater than that of great giants...”  


3. “And I said to the Grigori: ‘I saw your brethren and their works, and their great torments, and I prayed for them, but the Lord has condemned them to be under earth till heaven and earth shall end forever’. ....”  


4. THE BOOK OF ENOCH (**The Watchers**)  


5. “Then they (the angels) took wives, each choosing for himself, whom they began to approach, and with whom they cohabited; teaching them sorcery,  
incantations, and the divining of roots and trees. And the women conceiving brought forth giants, whom stature was each three hundreth cubits. ....  


6. ”To Michael likewise the Lord said,... bind them for seventy generations underneaththe earth,...”  


7. “From there I went on towards the extremities of the earth; where I saw large beasts different from each other, and birds various in countenances and forms,  
as well as with notes of different sounds. ... ”  


8. “From there I advanced on towards the north, to the extremities of the earth. And there I saw a great and glorious wonder at the extremities of the whole earth.I saw there heavenly gates opening into heavens; three of them distinctly separated. The northern winds proceeded from them, blowing cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain....”

**THE BOOK OF JUBILEES**  
9. “...that the angels of God saw them (earthly women) on a certain year of this jubilee, that they were beautiful to look upon;  
and they took themselves wives of all whom they chose, and they bare to them sons and they were giants. ...”  


10.“And against the angels whom He (God) had sent upon earth, He was exceedingly wroth, and He gave commandment to root them out of all their dominion,  
and He bade us to bind them in the depths of the earth, and behold they bound in the midst of them...”

**ADMIRAL RICHARD B. BYRD'S DIARY (FEB - MAR.1947)**  


**(“The Inner Earth : My Secret Diary”)**  
**THE LAND BEYOND THE POLES - THE EXPLORATION FLIGHT OVER THE NORTH POLE.**  


I must write this diary in secrecy and obscurity. It concerns my Arctic flight of the nineteenth day of February in the year of Nineteen and Forty Seven.  


There comes a time when the rationality of men must fade into insignificance and one must accept the inevitability of the Truth! am not at liberty to disclose the following documentation at this writing... perhaps it shall never see the light of public scrutiny, but I must do my duty and record here for all to read one day. In a world of greed and exploitation of certain of mankind, one can no longer suppress that which is truth.  


**1. FLIGHT LOG: BASE CAMP ARCTIC, 2119/1947**  
0600 HOURS - All preparations are complete for our flight north ward and we are airborne with full fuel tanks at 0610 Hours.....  


0910 HOURS - Vast Ice and snow below, note coloration of yellowish nature, and dispersed in a linear pattern. Altering course for a better examination of this color pattern below, note reddish or purple color also. Circle this area two full turns and return to assigned compass heading. Position check made again to base camp, and relay information concerning colorations in the Ice and snow below.  


0910 HOURS - Both Magnetic and Gyro compasses beginning to gyrate and wobble, we are unable to hold our heading by instrumentation. Take bearing with Sun compass, yet all seems well. The controls are seemingly slow to respond and have sluggish quality, but there is no indication of Icing!  


0915 HOURS - In the distance is what appears to be mountains.  


0949 HOURS -29 minutes elapsed flight time from the first sighting of the mountains, it is no illusion. They are mountains and consisting of a small range that I have never seen before!  


0955 HOURS - Altitude change to 2950 feet, encountering strong turbulence again.  


**2. 1000 HOURS**

We are crossing over the small mountain range and still proceeding northward as best as can be ascertained. Beyond the mountain range is what appears to be a valley with a small river or stream running through the center portion. There should be no green valley below! Something is definitely wrong and abnormal here! We should be over Ice and Snow! To the portside are great forests growing on the mountain slopes. ...

2.To this point, Ch.7, pg. 81.

1140 HOURS - Another radio message received. We begin the landing process now, and in moments the plane shudders slightly, and begins a descent as though caught in some great unseen elevator! The downward motion is negligible, and we touch down with only a slight jolt!  


1.1145 HOURS - I am making a hasty last entry in the flight log. Several men are approaching on foot toward our aircraft. They are tall with blond hair.  


2.In the distance is a large shimmering city pulsating with rainbow hues of color. I do not know what is going to happen now, but I see no signs of weapons on those approaching. I hear now a voice ordering me by name to open the cargo door. I comply.  


END LOG  


**3. MARCH 11, 1947**  
I have just attended a staff meeting at the Pentagon. I have stated fully my discovery and the message from the Master. All is duly recorded. The President has been advised. I am now detained for several hours (six hours, thirty-nine minutes, to be exact.) I am interviewed intently by Top Security Forces and a medical team. It was an ordeal! I am placed under strict control via the national security provisions of this United States of America. I am ORDERED TO REMAIN SILENT IN REGARD TO ALL THAT I HAVE LEARNED, ON THE BEHALF OF HUMANITY! Incredible! I am reminded that I am a military man I must obey orders....  


In further confirmation of Admiral Byrd's discovery are reports of individuals who claimed they had entered the north polar opening, as many Arctic explorers did without knowing they did, and penetrated far enough into it to reach the Subterranean World in the hollow interior of the Earth. Dr. Nephi Cottom of Los Angeles reported that one of his patients, a man of Nordic descent, told him the following story:  


""I lived near the Arctic Circle in Norway. One summer my friend and I made up our minds to take a boat trip together, and go as far as we could into the north country. So we put one month's food provisions in a small fishing boat, and with sail and also a good engine in our boat, we set to sea.  


4. At the end of one month we had travelled far into the north, beyond the Pole and into a strange new country. We were much astonished at the weather there. Warm, and at times at night it was almost too warm to sleep. Then we saw something so strange that we both were astonished. Ahead of the warm open sea we were on what looked like a great mountain. Into that mountain at a certain point the ocean seemed to be emptying. Mystified, we continued in that direction and found ourselves sailing into a vast canyon leading into the interior of the earth. We kept sailing and then we saw what surprised us - a sun shining inside the earth!”  


5. Several of the inner earth inhabitants - huge giants - detected our boat on the river, and were quite amazed...

1. The presence of the open sea in the Northland is also explained. Olaf Jansen claims that the northern aperture, intake or hole, so to speak, is about fourteen hundred miles across. In connection with this, let us read what Explorer Jansen 'writes, on page 288 of his book: *“I have never had such a splendid sail. On to the north steadily north, with a good wind, as fast as stream and sail can take us, an open sea mile after mile, watch after watch, through these unknown regions, always clearer and clearer of ice, one might almost say: 'How long will it last?' The eye always turns to the northward as one paces the bridge. It is gazing into the future. But them is always the same dark sky ahead which means open sea.”* Again, the Norwood Review of England, in its issue of May 10, 1884, says: *“We do not admit that there is ice up to the Pole - once inside the great ice barrier, a new world breaks upon the Explorer, the climate is mild like that of England, and, afterward, balmy as the Greek Isles.”.....*  


2. My name is Olaf Jansen. I am a Norwegian, although I was born in the little seafaring Russian town of Uleaborg, on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, the northern arm of the Baltic Sea.  


I was in my nineteenth year when we started on what proved to be our last trip as fishermen, and which resulted in the strange story that shall be given to the world, - but not until I have finished my earthly pilgrimage...  


There was a tradition my father explained, that still farther northward was a land more beautiful than any that mortal man had ever known, and that it was inhabited by the Chosen.  


3. My youthful imagination was fired by the ardor, zeal and religious fervor of my good father, and I exclaimed: 'why not sail to this goodly land? The sky is fair, the wind favorable and the sea open.""....  


The compass, which we had fastened back in its place, in fear of another storm, was still pointing due north, and moving on its pivot just as it had in Stockholm. The dipping of the needle had ceased. What could this mean? Then, too, our many days of sailing had certainly carried us far past the North Pole. And yet the needle continued to point north. We were sorely perplexed, for surely our direction was now south.....  


4. Along the banks great forests miles in extent could be seen stretching away on the shoreline. The trees were of enormous size. We landed after anchoring near a sandy beach, and waded ashore, and were rewarded by finding a quantity of nuts that were very palatable and satisfying to hunger, and a welcome change from the monotony of our stock of provisions....

It was about the first of September, over five months we calculated, since our leave taking from Stockholm Suddenly we were frightened almost out of our wits by hearing in the far distance the singing of people. Very soon thereafter we discovered a huge ship gliding down the river directly toward us. Those aboard were singing in one mighty chorus that, echoing from bank to bank, sounded like a thousand voices, filling the whole universe with quivering melody. The accompaniment was played on stringed instruments not unlike our harps.  


It was a larger ship than any we had ever seen, and was differently constructed....  


The immense craft paused, and almost immediately a boat was lowered and six men of gigantic stature rowed to our little fishing-sloop. They spoke to us in a strange language. We knew from their manner, however, that they were not unfriendly. They talked a great deal among themselves, and one of them laughed immoderately, as though in finding us a queer discovery had been made. One of them spied our compass, and it seemed to interest them more than any other part of our sloop.....  


1. ""They seem to be kindly disposed,"" I replied, ""although what terrible giants! They must be the select six of the kingdom's crack regiment. Just look at their great size....""  


2. The surprise of my father and myself was indescribable when, amid the regal magnificence of a spacious hall, we were finally brought before the Great High Priest, ruler over all the land. He was richly robed, and much taller than those about him, and could not have been less than fourteen or fifteen feet in height. The immense room in which we were received seemed finished in solid slabs of gold thickly studded with jewels of amazing brilliancy....  


3. I remember hearing my father remark that the giant race of people in the land of 'The Smoky God had almost as accurate an idea of the geography of the ""outside"" surface of the earth as had the average college professor in Stockholm.......  


*“That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;”* Phillipian 2:10  


*“And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.”* Revelations 5:3  


“Seven rivers I beheld upon earth, greater than all rivers, one of which takes its course from the west; it to a great sea its water flows. Two comes from the north to the sea, there waters flowing into the Erythraean sea, on the east. And with respect to the remaining four, they take their course in the cavity of the north” Book Of Enoch 76:6-7

**PROLOGUE:**  


IN THE FIRST PLACE PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THAT I do not expect you to believe this story. Nor could you wonder had you witnessed a recent experience of mine when, in the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance, I gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London....  


1.The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed before I was half through! It is all that saved him from exploding--and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship, gold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into the thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere....  


As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre and unnatural - THERE WAS NO HORIZON! As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom -distance was lost in the distance. That was all - here was no clear-cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision"". A great light is commencing to break on me,"" continued Perry, taking out his watch. ""I believe that I have partially solved the riddle It is now two o'clock. When we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us. Where is it now?""  


2. I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven. And such a sun! I had scarcely noticed it before. Fully thrice the size of the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it.....  


When we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the great plain we saw a caravan of men and women - human beings like ourselves-and for the first time hope and relief filled my heart, until I could have cried out in the exuberance of my happiness. It is true that they were a half-naked, wild-appearing aggregation; but they at least were fashioned along the same lines as ourselves - there was nothing grotesque or horrible about them as about the other creatures in this strange, weird world.  


3. But as we came closer, our hearts sank once more, for we discovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck in a long line,... With little ceremony Perry and I were chained at the end of the line, and without further ado the interrupted march was resumed....  


4. On we stumbled beneath that hateful noonday sun. If we fell we were prodded with a sharp point. Our companions in chains did not stumble. They strode along proudly erect. Occasionally they would exchange words with one another in a monosyllabic language. They were a noble-appearing race with well-formed heads and perfect physiques. The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women, smaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads. The features of both sexes were well proportioned..........

**MY EPILOGUE:**  
There are some additional notes I wish to point out before closing. According to the ancient manuscripts, **the Watchers** not only provoked God by going into earthly women but, they also provoked Him by going into different animals - bestiality. And they taught man these depraved acts as well. And the results of their offspring, as you would probably surmise: terrible giants, unheard of abominations, horrible to look upon. Even the ancient historian Herodotus (circa 500 BC) made minute quotes of some of these atrocities (sic) of nature. But let us quote from another ancient manuscripts that was mentioned by the chroniclers of Joshua 10:13, and 2 Samuel 1:18 :

**From THE BOOK OF JASHER**  
1.“And their judges and rulers (which were the giants at this time) went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice, and son of men of those days took from the cattle of the earth, the beasts of field, and fowls of the air, and taught the mixture of animals of one species with the other, in order therewith to provoke the Lord; and God saw that the whole earth and it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth, all men and all animals.”

**From THE BOOK OF JUBILEES**  


2.“And lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way, alike men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth - all of them  
corrupted their ways and their orders, and they began to devour each other,...”  


3. ...and the earth was filled with inquity (sic). And after this they sinned against the beasts and the birds, and all that moves and walks on the earth...”  


I think it may be high time that we all had a little private conference with our teachers of Archaeology, Paleontology, Anthropology, Geology, and as well as Geography and Cartography.  


“And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” Job 1:7

PSYOP-19 lay the groundwork for what is coming, as the central banks were provided the perfect “pandemic” excuse to conjure ever more fiat out of thin air, backed by nothing more than ever increasing unsustainable debt. In just the last 22 months the privately owned, unconstitutional and wholly criminal Federal Reserve “Bank” engaged in direct hyperinflationary policy. [In January 2020 The Fed went from $4 trillion on their asset books to $20 trillion in October 2021](https://www.sofx.com/2021/12/28/80-of-all-us-dollars-in-existence-were-printed-in-the-last-22-months-from-4-trillion-in-january-2020-to-20-trillion-in-october-2021-tech-startups/).

We have previously established in [Original Social Engineering Sin](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/original-social-engineering-sin?s=w) that income taxes are illegal, and as such are theft, while also showing that inflation is a direct function of money printing and also constitutes a “stealth tax”.

Between the privately owned IRS and the privately owned Fed, We the People are being decimated. As such, before ever more finally wake up from their State brainwashing, a “final solution” must be meted out by the Cult if the Great Reset 4th Industrial Revolution into technocratic posthuman dystopia is to be attained. Enter PSYOP-19 and the critically important DEATHVAX™ for the Depopulation and Control program.

Hyperinflation plus poverty equals death, depression, and Universal Basic Income (UBI). With each dollar being devalued by the criminal Fed every single millisecond of every business day, that $15 per hour wage buys less and less in basic necessities.

And now we have a new study by the corrupt radical left Oxfam America, which purports itself to be an “anti-poverty” and “pro-equality” organization that is funded by all the usual Cult players and is staffed by the same useful idiot social justice warriors, dropped some horror-show data in their recent study entitled, “The crisis of low wages in the US”:

>*""It's shameful that at a time when many US companies are boasting record profits, some of the hardest working people in this country -- especially people who keep our economy and society functioning -- are struggling to get by and falling behind,"" Kaitlyn Henderson, the study's author and senior research adviser at Oxfam America, told* [*CNN*](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/american-workers-15-dollars-hour-minimum-wage/index.html)*.* 

Of course, this was all by design. This is how UBI gets ushered in. And with Oxfam America, which has ties to the critical One World Government node known as the United Nations, they are concurrently pushing the “Climate Change” scam which perfectly integrates with CBDC UBI, “vax” passports, and ultimately social credit score passports.

With 31.9% of the US workforce, or about 51.9 million workers, earning less than $15 an hour, which is equivalent to less than $31,200, all while hyperinflation relentlessly devalues that “income” as the very corporations paying those unlivable wages forces employees to get DEATHVAXXED™, as gasoline and housing prices surge, as “income taxes” creep up, and food prices undergo simultaneous inflation and shrinkflation a perfect storm of hell on earth is being perpetrated for the slaves whose lifespans have been greatly shortened by the injectable bioweapons. And wages are not keeping up with the official inflation-adjusted numbers, but they’re really going extremely negative in terms of actual inflation.

“Building Back Better” indeed, when “better” means poverty straight to full-blown slavery and early graves all while continuing to pay taxes under threat of violence, and taking deadly injections under threat of violence, and thinking right to get the social credit score to release UBI and/or keep the slave gig under threat of violence, and so on and so forth.

The solutions would be exceedingly simple to restore freedom and alleviate the needless struggling of wage earners:

1. End the Fed
2. End the IRS
3. Shrink the Federal Government down by 90%

Solutions so simple that the criminal Cabal running the planet and the USSA would literally kill to prevent; see: JFK, etc.

Expect far worse PSYOP-22, PSYOP-CYBERWAR-22, PSYOP-POWER-GRID-22, and ever more false flags IF we comply.

Do NOT comply.

Climate change, originally called global warming, was later added to extreme climates such as hurricanes and wildfires in order to increase its impact on the public. Countries have developed policies aimed at slowing or halting the trend of climate change, mainly by controlling carbon emissions and introducing alternative energy sources.

## Is the climate change theory true?

Let's look at the numbers.

Human emissions of carbon dioxide account for 3.5% of the earth's greenhouse gases, and the rest of the greenhouse gases come from nature. Among them, ocean water evaporation accounts for 95% of the total greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gases account for 2% of the total atmosphere. Therefore, human emissions of carbon dioxide only account for 0.04% of the total atmosphere. Is this 4 in 10,000 factor enough to turn the climate around?

Sunlight, volcanic eruptions, cosmic rays, the solar system, atmospheric circulation, water vapor, and methane are all factors that affect temperatures more than carbon dioxide, but climate change theorists never mention it.

During the glacial period, the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere was 10 times higher than it is now, and in recent years, the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is the lowest in the history of the earth. What's wrong with this picture?

If you're old enough, you'll remember that in the 1970s, the mainstream media in the United States consistently preached that the world was cooling, and 88 years later, it suddenly took a U-turn and preached that the world was warming.

Is this transition related to carbon dioxide? No. The truth is that the earth's temperature fluctuates periodically, and the 1980s was at the end of the earth's 40-year cooling cycle. Now the ice and snow coverage at the poles is similar to the coverage in the 30s and 40s.

Climate change conspiracy theories say melting ice caps will reduce polar bear populations and lead to more extreme weather. But there are actually five times as many polar bears as they were in 1970, hurricane levels are at their lowest since 1900, and droughts are flat.

Step back 10,000 steps, even if carbon dioxide does affect climate change, let's move on to the discussion.

## Are the emission reduction policies formulated by politicians in various countries effective?

No. The carbon emission caps set by developed countries have caused big companies to move their production lines to Asia and discharge their pollutants in a rougher and more intensive way, as if the greenhouse gases emitted by Asia are not on the earth. Neither demand nor supply has diminished, isn't it fooling yourself to just change production in another place?

Who profited from climate change conspiracy theories?

1. The media got ratings from the audience's ""worrying""
2. Environmental organizations and academic institutions have received donations
3. Some big companies benefit from globalization
4. Others gain an 'environmental protector' image
5. Western leftist politicians play the role of savior to harvest public opinion
6. The CCP is the biggest winner

&#x200B;

## What were the results of the policy implementation?

Developed countries join the Paris climate agreement to set a cap on carbon emissions. This move increases the cost of industries and manufacturing in various countries, causing small factories to close down, and big companies justifiably set up factories in China, where labor and law-abiding costs are lower, and discharge pollution in a rougher, more intensive, and unregulated way.

## Who are the Losers?

U.S native manufacturing and Chinese people. On the one hand, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and other states in the United States, which are deeply affected by globalization, have become ""rust belts"". For example, the once prosperous Detroit Motor City has now become a ghost town.

On the other hand, the GDP created by the Chinese people goes into the pockets of certain CCP families, foreign politicians and international organizations. There is basically no national welfare in China, but the living environment has deteriorated. The CCP has established concentration camps for millions of people in Xinjiang, and obtained low to almost zero labor costs, including women’s hair, internal organs, and Nike factories.

## Vested interests

Large international companies have lower costs and more monopoly advantages in the market. The GDP has grown, the fat cats have become fatter, and the CCP's harvest has been better. The CCP gives part of the dividends to foreign politicians who make policies. Large corporations distribute dividends to environmental groups. The policy has two other benefits for leftist politicians in the West, one of which is maintaining power.

The loss of jobs in the United States has led to the migration of population to big cities and the rise of unemployment. These are all welcome by left-wing politicians, because those who lie down and eat welfare will become their supporters and voter base. Leftist politicians use people's reverence for nature and worries about future uncertainty to garner public opinion and votes.

## Alternative energy is not as green as you think

Has anyone compared the carbon emissions produced by producing an EV battery to the carbon emissions produced during normal car use? Have you considered the environmental pollution caused by the disposal of automobile waste batteries? In fact, more fossil fuels are used to make a solar panel than the fuel needed to generate electricity from fossil fuels over the lifetime of the solar panel!

No one dares to oppose it publicly. Anyone who raised objections was ostracized, suspended, and suppressed. Green energy is a propaganda method for whitewashing and profit-making in the petrochemical industry. It is a means for electric vehicles to obtain government subsidies to catch up with the traditional automobile manufacturing industry.

## Omnipotent environmental protection banner

The fracking method used in the U.S. oil extraction process is strongly opposed by Biden on the grounds of environmental protection. The prohibition policy implemented after he took office has brought major disasters to the U.S. oil extraction industry, destroying 1.1 million related jobs.

Externally, the United States has to resume its dependence on imported oil, while major countries should not rely on imports for industrial and agricultural energy. Internally, the decline in the employment rate, the further migration of population to big cities, and the deterioration of social security have ensnared many to the Democratic Party’s welfare trap.

## The environmental banner is one of the conspiracies of the globalist communist agenda

Several concepts need to be distinguished here: environmental protection, environmental protection movement and environmentalism.

**Environmental protection**, as the name suggests, is the protection of the environment. Since there is human civilization, there has been human protection of the environment. This kind of environmental protection has nothing to do with any political ideology.

**Environmental Protection Movement.** The environmental protection movement is a social and political movement aimed at environmental issues. Its main body is to change environmental policies and public psychology and behavioral habits through massive mass movements, media offensives and complex and ingenious political operations.

**Environmentalism**. Environmentalism is a philosophical thought and political ideology that emphasizes the protection of the environment and the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. The origin of environmental protection movement and environmentalism is not the same as that of communism, but the evil specter of communism is good at kidnapping mass movements, manipulating and exploiting the social situation.

\- - -

Therefore, from the beginning of modern environmentalism, the evil specter of communism has systematically arranged to kidnap it and use it for it's own evil purpose.

The factors behind environmentalism worldwide today are extremely complex. It used moving rhetoric and took advantage of people's kind and beautiful wishes to set off a political movement that swept the world. There are many people who are kind, have a sense of justice, and truly care about the future and destiny of mankind. But the factors behind this movement is the evil specter of communism, which uses the moral high ground of environmental protection to advance its own agenda.

In this movement, environmental protection has been highly politicized, radicalized and even religious; traditional moral foundations have been forgotten, and misleading propaganda and even various coercive political tricks have become the dominant factors. Environmentalism is becoming another form of communism.

However, the globalists and the international elite were not satisfied with just this, and planned the **""Great Reset""** plan in 2020, which was aimed at 'using' the epidemic to promote the totalitarian model to the world and establish a new international order - modern slavery.

I feel that this is an incredibly valuable message to share, particularly at this time in humanity's known history, so I felt a drive to re-share what I'd composed. Thank you all for your time.

\-----

Two years ago, I lived in a peaceful world where my only concerns arose from my own immediate experience. After going down the governmental rabbit hole, I’ve recognized how impactful the negative energy behind all these horrific realizations can be. I am hoping to alleviate the suffering, or the attachment to what we learn here. Because I firmly believe that, in order to combat this horror-drama time span in the universe’s narrative for humanity, we must remember true love. I know this sounds corny, but it’s more real than I think we initially assume. I apologize for the length — I tend to get personal so as to most effectively/honestly relate my thoughts to the reader. I’d also like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my personal thoughts. I promise that these are always written from an honest and passionate heart.

\-----

I pop in to r/conspiracy  every so often to read what is going on in the world — or at least that which we are slowly exposed to despite it going on for a long, long time. And in recognizing how impactful some of this horrible news can be as you wake up to the truth behind the society in which we participate, I want to do whatever I can to alleviate the suffering that can come as a result of the learning we do here. Because the only way, I think, we’re going to overcome all of these traumatic realizations is that we come together with Love. Not the false love we’ve been introduced to for centuries — the kind of love in which you love someone or something so that you can, in turn, receive love back — but the true love in which you love genuinely and selflessly. You love for nothing in return. You forget yourself and your own illusory ‘me’ world. Bear with me.

A year ago, I was depressed. I had no reason to be, other than my thoughts were telling me to be. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was suicide or stare my fears in the face. Fortunately, I chose to stare my fears in the face. In that moment, I recognized that my fears were illusory. They were attachments to some ‘thing’ in life, whether it was attaining an object and fearing not getting it or becoming a certain person and fearing not becoming it, or even fearing death through an attachment to this life of mine. These pressures needn’t exist because they fundamentally don’t exist. We create them. This ‘them’ is the ego. It is the illusion for which we think, a false center in consciousness, also called ‘me’.

Generally speaking, most individuals exist in very personal worlds that are separate from all else. We have our own problems, our own realities, our own individual chaotic maelstroms of desires and concerns. And because we’ve believed in the illusion of existing in a consciousness that is fundamentally separate from the world outside of us for so long, we’ve forgotten the most powerful and useful aspect of all of nature: everything is One, everything is related, and everything is Love. Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. We literally feel separate from the universe, when the universe is the mother out of which we become. But we feel other than the universe? People really believe that each of us comes into this world, when in truth each of us comes out of it. That simple truth speaks volumes of the reasoning behind the chaotic reality which we currently have in front of us.

Fundamentally, we’ve forgotten love. Love has been substituted with artificial constructs (gadgets of technology, falsely loving someone in order to love yourself rather than loving someone selflessly, getting a better job, a better car, winning a war, finding a religion, and so on). I know this sounds hippy. I played college football and was raised in an all-American household. Hippy, flower-loving talk did not exist; it was foreign and rightfully so, I believed. But screw that. We can act like this isn’t true by avoiding this wound and disallowing it from healing, or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge that we’ve drifted from true love, forgive ourselves, and allow the magical process of self-healing to rubber band back to its origin of authentic love.

Here’s my concern. A year ago, I recognized the truth about how the world, which includes myself, had forgotten love. For a span of a few months, I experienced a sort of ineffable bliss in which I finally remembered true love and felt it for all things outside of my own self. Let me tell you something.. experiencing true love at all times of the day, which we can all do, is a hefty reminder as to why this whole ‘existing’ thing happens. The best way I can creatively describe that bliss is in this way: I am a musician and I love music more than anything. I uncontrollably cry when I hear a piano key being played at the most perfect time in unison with a violin. The magic I feel from music is ineffable. And when i rediscovered true love, everything I saw was being seen through the paradigm of that feeling I get from music. Everything was the same one song. It was all one verse, a UniVerse.

But once I’d become aware of politicians participating in spirituality focusing on negative energy, rather than positive, world-leaders being fake beauty queens with personal agendas, economies collapsing, climate change accelerating and showing signs of becoming even more relentless over the years to come, talk of extra-terrestrial life that’s been hidden from the public…I mean, so many mind-boggling happenings are being introduced to our minds. It’s overwhelming — at least it was to me. I admit that the negativity that has surfaced has brought me to the depths of hell. Myself, along with few others I’ve talked with, have unfortunately internalized the disgust so as to try and understand it. Well, I’m not sure it can be understood by any loving soul. It’s so, so foreign. So gross, so dirty, so sickly.

And if you’re on this forum, you likely care about humanity. I’d assume most of us are more sensitive people than others we might find elsewhere. Sensitive people feel compassion. And to be compassionate — to have an aware heart — and to know what’s really happening in the world while there are people walking around blind to the truth…that can have a massive impact. I, personally, have just wanted to cry and cry for months on end now. The emotional weight of this 180 degree turn that my understanding of reality has taken was, at one point, unbearable. But this is why I wrote to you all today.

What I’ve learned throughout the past year in solitude is that life seems to suck right now for the collective, but it needn’t be that way and it will not forever. That’s why change is happening now and the universe is going through a shedding of its skin, bringing to light unfathomable evil in the process. But the unfathomable evil, which we’ve been veiled from knowing for so long, can instill in any sensitive person some pretty massive confusion, disgust, and suffering. This is what we need to be aware of.

The more we suffer, the more ‘they’ win. Be aware of that and make a point of it. Each loving act you do has an impact. Every moment you take to genuinely love anyone, a family member, a coworker, a stranger…it makes a difference in this Matrix. And as all this information is exposed, we can either respond as awake people and culminate massive love as a response. Or we can fall victim to the unveiling horrors and helplessly fall down an even darker path before the universe sympathetically takes a U-turn.

Think about this: when you do something good for someone else and have no expectation of what you’ll receive in return, how god damn awesome does it feel when you see that person’s face light up after you’ve been kind? When you expect absolutely nothing in return, you can’t be let down. Let me say that again...when you expect *nothing*, you **CANNOT BE LET DOWN**. WHEN YOU EXPECT NOTHING, YOU ARE ALWAYS HIGH. WHEN YOU EXPECT NOTHING, YOU ARE FINALLY PRESENT, AS WHO YOU REALLY ARE. YOU ARE INVINCIBLE WHEN YOU ARE UNATTACHED.  UNCONDITIONAL LOVE CAN ONLY EXIST THROUGH AN UNATTACHED MIND. Try to absorb that truth and your entire frequency will change in an instant -- you'll feel it.

And when you can’t be let down and are living with authentic and real love — not that fake love crap we’ve been raised to believe is real — but the real stuff, selfless love…that’s when magic happens. That’s when you remember who you really are and what life is all about. That’s when you look your loved ones in the eyes again and remember that magnetic pull you feel from their heart to yours. You love again. You live again. The darkness has no ability to penetrate that authentic love. It’s the most powerful emotional manifestation of the universe that we can experience. And in order to be invincible and overcome this revealing period of turmoil, we must remember true love and tap into that deep, deep sense of oneness which we can all experience perpetually so long as we remain selfless and put our own agendas aside. Such a thing is hard to fathom in modern society when we’ve been raised to ‘be the best’ but we’re remembering who and what we are and that we’ve drifted from the truth. Thus, I believe our personal agendas are either going to fall apart and crumble as the universe has a plan to reintroduce humanity to what’s meaningful and worth giving our attention to, particularly right now, or we can make the choice to remember true love on our own by taking fundamental responsibility.

Loving is the easiest thing to do once you forget your own agenda. I love you guys. I know that each of you is simply a ‘different’ manifestation of what I really am, and vice versa. Now, let’s all start living that way. Let’s live as One. For those of you who tend to misread my message and PM me to get out of here with my NWO preaching, I’m not speaking in the sense of One government, but in the sense of universal lovingness. A world in which we realize that everything is related and is made of the same stuff. Where no one is judged and everyone is celebrated. Where everyone’s intention is for the benefit of others and not for the benefit of self. That is where we will win.",conspiracy,climate change

The Asian Giant Hornet is a well known invasive species, but this article makes it a point to state that the insect is ""commonly referred to"" as the ""Murder Hornet"" according to ""researchers."" 

I have never ever heard anyone call it ""Murder Hornet"" before this article, it has really ever only been called the Asian Giant Hornet (or Japanese Giant Hornet) and again, it has been well known as an invasive species for some time. Even the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet) makes no mention of the term ""Murder Hornet"" as of the time of this post (2 May 2020.) 

I did a quick google search of the term ""Murder Hornet"" and the **only** results for this term are from the last few days, with people picking up this ""story"" and re-posting and retweeting it. 

There are no mentions in google of anyone calling it the ""Murder Hornet"" before the last day or so, however *every article* about this insect written in the last day or so makes a point to say that it is ""commonly referred to"" as the ""Murder Hornet"" even though there is no actual evidence anyone ever called it the ""Murder Hornet"" before these articles were written.

Its almost like these articles on this well known invasive species were written just to create a new name for the Asian Giant Hornet in the public consciousness.

I wonder why they want people to call it the ""Murder Hornet"" right now, instead of the ""Asian Giant Hornet"" which is its established common name?

Maybe it is as simple as ""Murder Hornet"" is more attention grabbing headline then ""Asian Giant Hornet"" but also consider the current climate of censoring terms for negative things that are associated with ""Asia"" or ""China.""

Could this be another example of how the media is subtly suggesting to people that its not acceptable to use any terms that may cast Asia or specifically China in a bad light, even though in this case they are talking about an invasive insect that came from Asia and not Asian people?

Is this is a small part of a multi-tiered propaganda effort to disassociate negative things that have ""Asia"" or ""China"" in their names by some western media outlets, and change our vernacular? 

Go google ""Murder Hornet"" yourself and click back through the pages to try find any reference of anyone calling it a 
""Murder Hornet"" before the last few days. It has always been the Asian Giant Hornet and I want people to remember that before the Mandela effect kicks in and everyone starts calling it ""Murder Hornet"" from now on.

So what you are seeing going on is not divide and conquer of the people, the division is right at the top of the system, allow me to explain.

What's going on is actually very simple, we have Globalists Vs Zionists, Zionists who are joining forces with all Nationalists around the planet.

The Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda.

The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them. As long as you leave these guys alone, they won't bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren't very visible, the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart, Infowars, WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc.

These guys all used to work together, but now that the Globalist plan is in it's advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren't happy with the way things were going, so they've now started to dismantle bit by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda, as those taxes are to fund the Globalist world government. The Zionists have allied with Nationalists, and they are fast gaining ground on the Globalists.

Of course, the Globalists know exactly who was trying to influence the US election using WikiLeaks etc, but nobody is allowed to say it, so instead they publicity blame Russia who actually had very little to do with it, though were pleased with the result.  Equally Globalists from around the world try to influence every US election.

This is an unusual moment when the Zionists are currently allied with most people on /conspiracy, everyone is needed onboard to defeat the Globalist project, it is like at the end of the film Avatar where all tribes around the planet had to unite to fight the most powerful and evil enemy of all i.e. The Globalists and their NWO.

**Update** I should add that the Globalist end-game is WW3 with Russia, this is to divide and conquer the planet, they will use the horror of war as the excuse to usher in their totalitarian climate tax-funded UN world government i.e. Game Over, they win!  If Hillary had got elected we'd already be in the early stages, whereas now Trump is there to stop it, as WW3 against Russia does not benefit the Zionists, it actually puts them at great risk.

**“Research both sides and make up your own mind**.” It’s simple, straightforward, common sense advice. And when it comes to issues like vaccinations, climate change, and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it can be dangerous, destructive, and even deadly. The techniques that most of us use to navigate most of our decisions in life — gathering information, evaluating it based on what we know, and choosing a course of action — can lead to spectacular failures when it comes to a scientific matter.

**There’s an old saying that I’ve grown quite fond of recently: you can’t reason someone out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into**. 

When most of us “research” an issue, what we are actually doing is:

* formulating an initial opinion the first time we hear about something,
* evaluating everything we encounter after that through that lens of our gut instinct,
* finding reasons to think positively about the portions of the narrative that support or justify our initial opinion,
* and finding reasons to discount or otherwise dismiss the portions that detract from it.“",conspiracy,climate change

2. more electric and hybrid cars than ever are being sold, a significant chunk of cars globally is now either hybrid, electric, or very efficient petrol powered (with the latest engines which are built smaller and are utilizing the fuel better to achieve close or same performance as the bigger volume engines)
3. many new laws and enforcement to make sure people conform to many standards that have a lot to do with responsible disposal of trash, responsible usage of resources (water, electricity, etc..)
4. A ton more recycling, so we presumably reuse many materials instead of using new raw materials.
5. Much smaller families (less children per family on average), which means much less consumption of many things.

With this post I want to further flesh out my trail of thought and I believe this subreddit would be the best place to do so.

Before we begin, however, a small disclaimer: this is all speculation and conjecture and is the result of a thought experiment in the mind of a sovereign individual who enjoys to think, question and postulate hypotheses. I cannot prove any of it, so read it as you would read fiction.

Now, on with it:

#The vaccine in of itself is not the endgame

But it provides a framework and foundation for a method of mass population control. A trail of thought:

##Service Access Control

Ticketmaster plans to prohibit anyone from attending events without a negative test result in the past 24-72 hours. Many details of the plan, which is still in development phase, will rely on three separate components -- the Ticketmaster digital ticket app, third party health information companies like CLEAR Health Pass or IBM's Digital Health Pass and testing and vaccine distribution providers like Labcorp and the CVS Minute Clinic. (source: https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan/)

On the surface of it, to prevent the spread of the virus at mass gatherings, this does appear to be a reasonable, simple and understandable logic. Most people won't think twice and just accept it because it makes sense because it makes sense in stopping the spread of the virus.

Members of the US president elect's COVID task force suggests to bundle services that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) as a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. This includes but is probably not limited to: food security, rent assistance, free clinic services. (source: https://www.naturalnews.com/files/200709-The-Publics-Role-in-COVID-19-Vaccination.pdf)

Now as we've already been conditioned to _""wear a mask""_, _""keep your distance""_ and _""wash your hands""_ notifications before entry anywhere, it's not such big a leap to _""proof of vaccine or no admittance""_ signs popping up everywhere. This will effectively require you to prove you've been vaccinated in order to attend events, access medical care, buy groceries, cross a border, ...

(Note: this does not require the virus itself to be a hoax, but we _are_ conditioned to the masks and the overall literature depicting and delimiting appropriate behavior required to access services)

Edit: as noted by Coches in the comments below, Slovakia has begun blanket testing and implementing harsh restrictions similar to house arrest for those that do not comply with voluntary testing (source: https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/europe/slovakia-mass-coronavirus-test-intl/index.html) 

##ID2020

Now that the general public is primed to accept these measures comes the next question, for those of us that still ask questions, _how_ will we meet these requirements and prove that we've been vaccinated? Now some of us conspiracy theorists suggested the vaccine will contain a micro chip with RFID that can be scanned at checkpoints. While we do have this technology available, our overlords know that we won't accept this _yet_. Instead, it's far easier to use the technology that's already in place en masse. Just look at how Ticketmaster is creating an app to join forces with medical data gathering houses.

We can give everyone who's vaccinated a unique and globally identifiable token in a central government controlled database. You can authenticate on these apps using a government issued token which you receive upon vaccination and then provide the checkpoints with a QR code that validates your vaccination status thus giving you access to these public and private services. Not really that hard nowadays if you know anything of IT.

Anyway, now that we've established identification and verification at various private and public service checkpoints, there's a couple of tangents that seem unrelated to the uninitiated of ""connecting the dots"".

##5G Localization

_""5G spr3ADs CoRonA V1rus!""_ is a false flag conspiracy theory. What I mean by that is that is a theory inserted into the conspiracy community to make us look like dim-witted fools and to ostracize anyone questioning 5G.

In a technologically advance world, we do need such network for all the Internet of Things to communicate efficiently with as little ping as possible. One of the benefits of 5G is that we can pinpoint a device's location to up to decimeter accuracy (source: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/industry-articles/how-will-5g-networks-improve-location-awareness/)

This is great news because we have the ID2020 installed on our smartphones and that means that the authorities can locate any one registered individual to their exact location at all times. Because let's not forget, you can't access any public or private service without proper identification (the vaccination registration database makes sure of that)

Of course, the rural areas will continue to enjoy 4G with it's lesser advanced technology, but you can still be tracked to within a couple of meters of accuracy.

##End-to-End Encryption

The first tangent I want to explore are the global attempts at banning end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication and encrypted data in cloud storage.

In the US, the EARN-IT act attempts to backdoor E2EE, this act is now in the house of representatives (source: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/urgent-earn-it-act-introduced-house-representatives) as well as the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that aims to subvert secure cloud data storage (source: https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/why-lawful-access-encrypted-data-act-threat-your-rights-and-privacy)

Recently, this topic has come up at the EU council as well, weighing the pros and cons of encryption in privacy vs (state) security. It doesn't straightforward suggest to ban or backdoor E2EE, but it does state that _""law enforcement and judicial authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner""_ (source: https://www.statewatch.org/media/1434/eu-council-draft-declaration-against-encryption-12143-20.pdf)

This is the point where I should tell you to read between the lines, but let me spell out my thoughts anyways: **both EU and US are under the control of the same shadow government.**

##Big Data Algorithms

All major social media platforms collect your data and run it through an algorithm to build a profile of you so it can feed you content you are more likely to interact with. TikTok being the latest addition which is currently the third most downloaded non-gaming app of the year (source: https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/)

TikTok has a really good algorithm that gives users the content that they want. So good in fact that the US government threatened to ban the app if it didn't get a piece of the pie (or do you really think it was about the security and privacy of its citizens after proposing two bills that undermine this anyway?)

Extensive data collection + algorithm = digital gold for marketeers and governments alike. That _profile_ that is built with the collected data from social media applications reflects not only your interests commercially but also your political ideologies.

##Quarantine Camps

New Zealand, an example to the entire world in terms of progressiveness, is raising quarantine camps to hold anyone testing positive (even against their will) until they test negative. (source: https://thegreggjarrett.com/new-zealand-announces-quarantine-camps-where-positive-patients-will-be-forcibly-placed/)

This is a precursor to vaccination camps, where we will be culling the population that does not comply with the ""guidelines"" at first and later anyone that can be profiled as a dissident to the New World Order (based on social media big data collection and the compromise of your E2EE private messaging)

If you do not believe people are capable of such atrocities, I suggest you read the Gulag Archipelago, an account of the Communist regime in the USSR of past century. Or do you think we humans have evolved beyond such systemic incarceration? Just look at the war on drugs and how many people are behind bars for what is now being legalized (Cannabis _and_ psychedelics) There's no need for physical torture if they can just lock you up where you can do no harm to ""civilized"" society.

##The Plan

In summary, the population needs to keep its attention focused on elected and fact-checked news outlets in which the authorities will tell you what the narrative is. Keeping you fear-induced and providing you with the deus ex machina solution (a well known marketing strategy, source: https://brenits.com/scare-tactics-in-branding-and-marketing/ and https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/10/fear-based-appeals)

Most people will get their vaccine as such and just like that. Then another portion of the population will get theirs to get access to the services they need. Vaccination camps will be introduced for anyone unwilling to comply.

Because we won't accept RFID chips just yet, we start by introducing the smartphone as the first platform to track your vaccination / compliance status to access services you require.

All of this can be linked to our social media accounts as well as your private communications upon which a profile can be built. Anyone profiled as a threat to the New World Order can have their vaccination status revoked, be located and sent to vaccination camps (remember, their goal is not the vaccination in of itself, that's only the narrative, the reality is to get rid of dissidents)

#The Goal

What's the purpose of all this though? A New World Order? The Great Reset?

The social contract is changing, whether we like it or not. Watch the World Economic Forum's video on the Great Reset (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHRkkeecg7c) and tell me these people aren't bigger than governments.

It's the pandemic now, the climate crisis next. We will police ourselves into ushering in a New World Order. On the one hand I can believe this to bring about a global Utopian society without warring countries, pandemics or climate crises. But ignorance is bliss until you take a closer look at how we get there, there's a shadow that stains the soul of humanity. 

I assure you, the frog never noticed the water heating up until it was boiling. But please, do keep watching television, believe the mainstream narrative, do not question your leaders on the magic picture box for they hold all the answers and the alternative is far uglier.

##Do Not Dispair

On a retrospective note, I do not wish for anyone to become afraid and would like to point to Charlie Chaplin's final speech at the end of The Great Dictator:

>To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

from the start, I have continuously questioned Canada’s response to this ‘pandemic’. none of this made any sense, none of it added up, there was no way to connect the dots or to justify this.

I constantly wondered why Canada? at the moment we are the only country (that I know of) that bans the un-‘vaccinated’ from travelling, even domestically! There’s a weasel politician at the helm that despite his racist actions and discrimination towards millions of Canadians, has been re-appointed as PM. Our election process is corrupt and a joke.

The answer is simple, Canada has the pathway with the least resistance, Canadians are usually unassuming and quite trustworthy of the gouvernement with little to no opposition or criticism. The Canadian Charter of Rights is pathetic and poorly constructed, it is not as sacred as the United States Amendments. Canada can also be easily controlled; smaller population of only 38 million, rules that can easily be established nation-wide across all 10 Provinces, as oppose to Americas 50 States, which are mostly pretty much there own entities and self-governed. All the Liberals had to do was incentivize them and they all followed suit. Our Parliament is hysterical, if you watch any of the debates you would honestly assume it’s an SNL skit made up of toddlers, politicians are practically never prosecuted for their crimes. There’s this fake connotation about Canada as this peaceful, innocent country and most are brainwashed into thinking so. 

We are leading the way for the WEF’s great reset, even our major airlines are already adopting digital IDs, most of our major politicians are WEF members, Trudeau and his family have stolen millions upon millions and people are still blind to his hypocrisy, as he travels in a PJ emitting an unimaginable amount of CO2 while lecturing people about climate change, or implementing the Emergency Act on Canadians while talking about freedom and sovereignty, or censoring content online while talking about disinformation, or talking about racism while dressing up in black face countless times. This country is ruined and he is the primary blame.

144,Did California Governor Gavin Newsom Enter Into A Corrupt Deal With A Chinese Company in a $1.4 billion dollar deal to buy N-95 masks with a electric bus maker company that has NO HISTORY of making masks?,258.0,k1dbfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k1dbfe/did_california_governor_gavin_newsom_enter_into_a/,31.0,1606388431.0,"Why didn't he use an American company like 3M?



**Governor Newsom’s Dubious Mask Deal Brings Corruption Concerns**


June 4, 2020


written by Michael Palomba 



Gov. Gavin Newsom made a $1.4 billion deal with BYD, a Chinese company, to produce N-95 masks. What’s weird about this situation is that BYD is an electric bus maker with no history of making masks. What’s even weirder is that the masks never came to fruition because they failed to meet national safety and health standards.



The story begins in March with a different company. A deal was made with Blue Frame Medical LLC, a recently formed company made up of political consultants looking to cash in on the pandemic. Newsom facilitated a $456.9 million transaction with the company, wiring the funds in exchange for millions of masks. However, shortly after the transfer was initiated, the State Controller’s office got a call from the bank, notifying them that the account they were transferring to was opened just one day before. 



The state immediately requested its money back and began its search for a new company to produce masks. In April, a deal was struck with BYD, but the contract was kept hidden from legislators and the media.



The California Globe has found “a trail of well-connected players” involved in the $1.4 billion mask deal. 



These players include:



Mark Weideman: a prominent lobbyist who represents BYD. BYD’s automotive division contributed $40,000 to Newsom’s campaign.


Mark Weideman’s wife, Jennifer Wada: their marriage is not common knowledge even to many Sacramento insiders. Wada currently owns a government relations business.


Anthony Williams: prior to that owning a government relations business, Wada and a man named Anthony Williams were partners in a law firm: Wada, Williams Law Group. Anthony Williams is now Gov. Newsom’s Legislative Affairs Secretary.


There are also links to Tom Steyer, the failed presidential candidate who also happens to be Newsom’s Economic Recovery Committee Chairman.



According to California Globe, a source said the governor was able to pivot so quickly from the bad Blue Flame Medical deal to BYD because of the connections between Weideman, Wada, and Williams.



California Globe sent an email to Weideman in an attempt to get to the bottom of all this, here is the response they received:



“Newsom and his aides singled out BYD-America, which manufactures electric buses in Lancaster and has been a beneficiary of California’s efforts to combat climate change,” CalMatters reported in April. “Mark Ghilarducci, Newsom’s director of the Office of Emergency Services, said BYD has a direct reachback into China to be able to build a sustainable amount of monthly masks that will be coming in to assist us.”



It seems like something is not right here. Why are all of these well-connected players involved? How was a decision made to source ventilators from a company that was only days old? And how did the governor pivot to a new company—that has no business making masks—so quickly?




We may be able to answer these questions if the details were not being hidden from the public. It appears that someone doesn’t want these details publicized, and that is all the more reason why they should be. These are our tax dollars being played with, and if they are being used incorrectly, we must find out and hold people accountable.

What happens when Wall Street finally figures out that BlackRock itself is a vital node of PSYOP-19 and the upcoming “climate change” social credit score passport?

One of the most effective ways of defeating this horrific “futurist” dystopia is via Wall Street itself; the irony of Wall Street devouring itself as the “market” crash is finally unleashed will be a sight to behold, as the BigPharma space is imploded, taking down an important component of this post-human trial run nightmare that we finds ourselves in.

As Canada reveals its hand for the upcoming social credit score control via personal finances and private property which requires BigTech and banking sector collaboration and compliance, we will see the big brains of Wall Street rebel due to said “vax” and “research” fraud, thus hampering the current quickening of the corporate fascist coalescence.

When the smart money itself follows the money, and said smart money drains money from the Wall Street side of Cult operations we may see the fast approaching end of today’s tyranny. Trudeau will soon be sacrificed, and his government will be easing up.

# How Fluoride Affects Consciousness and the Will to Act

Recent research has brought the controversial practice of water fluoridation back into the spotlight, revealing links between water fluoridation and brain disorders, particularly in regard to its effect on children.

Troublingly, the report found that side-effects do not only come from direct ingestion by children, but also from higher levels of chemicals such as fluoride in expectant mothers' blood and urine, which was linked to brain disorders and lower IQs in their children.

In many cases, the changes triggered can be permanent. This evidence flies right in the face of spurious claims by skeptics that ingestion of fluoride in low concentrations has no harmful effects on our health.

Is it any wonder then that only seven countries in the world actually fluoridate more than 50 percent of their water supply?

Although it is often portrayed in America as if every country does it, this is very far from the truth.

In fact, the United States accounts for more than 50 percent of all the fluoridated water drinkers in the world, while the vast majority of European countries for example avoid this practice altogether.

>So what is fluoride and why do a few countries continue to infuse their public drinking water with this controversial chemical?What ramifications might its side effects have for human development?

## How Water Fluoridation Came to Be

Although there is widespread acceptance that fluoride is toxic in high doses, a trend emerged in the twentieth century to add this chemical to drinking water at dosages deemed to be ""safe."" Where did this trend originate?

It may surprise you to hear that apparently, the first occurrence of purposefully putting sodium fluoride into drinking water took place in the German ghettos of the 30s and 40s, and shortly thereafter in Nazi concentration camps.

Clearly, the Nazis would not be concerned with the strength and resilience of their prisoners' teeth; so,

>What could be the real reason to fluoridate the water?What effects does it really have upon us?And why are countries such as the United States still doing it?

Let's now look at how water fluoridation started in America.

An industry researcher from the Mellon Institute financed by the Alcoa Company first recommended water fluoridation in America in 1939. Seeing as Alcoa had toxic waste, a bi-product from aluminum otherwise known as fluoride, and stood to benefit from finding a way to sell and dispose of it, could this really be a coincidence?

The report convinced dentists and the public at large that water fluoridation is good for our teeth. With this, whether intended or not, the industry gained a way to get toxic waste off their hands, and moreover, even be paid to get rid of it - by selling it off to be dumped into the public water supply.

In 1946, an attorney and former counsel to Alcoa was appointed to head the U.S. Public Health Service.

Shortly thereafter, he ensured that the water fluoridation ""experiment"" passed essentially unchallenged and unchecked by any real public study or research and was soon given a $750K private bonus from Alcoa.

In today's dollars, that's worth anywhere from $6.89 million to $55.3 million, depending on how you account for inflation.

But some people have identified a more sinister agenda behind water fluoridation that goes beyond apparent greed and convenience. At the end of World War II, **Charles Elliot Perkins**, a researcher in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology, was sent to Germany to take charge of their chemical plants.

He later wrote in response to what he had seen and heard while there:

>""The real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty…

Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluorine will in time gradually reduce the individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing this area of the brain tissue, and making him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him.""

## How Fluoride Suppresses Consciousness

[ Pineal gland parenchyma with calcifications](https://preview.redd.it/dp131f5vzjr81.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=261022316e5eb84983ac183a236aa1ab5b5605d0)

But how does a chemical bi-product dumped into the water supply actually work upon those who ingest it over time?

There are many ways sodium fluoride consumption affects our bodies, but one aspect we'll focus on in this article is that sodium fluoride calcifies the pineal gland.

British scientist **Jennifer Luke** published a study (Fluoride Deposition in the Aged Human Pineal Gland) which found that fluoride deposits tended to accumulate in the pineal gland and calcify it.

In addition, a 450-page review on fluoride toxicity published by the National Research Council in 2006 reported that fluoride produced a range of negative side effects including,

>""decreased melatonin production"" and ""other effects on normal pineal function, which in turn could contribute to a variety of effects in humans.""

Not just scientists, but mystics too have explored the effects of the pineal gland within us (from different angles):

>physically, it plays an important role in regulating sleep patterns and sexual developmentspiritually, it is said to be a connection between the body and the soul, and is referred to by some as our ""third eye""

Either way, when the pineal gland is calcified by sodium fluoride, it obviously cannot function properly.

This could have grave effects both physically and spiritually upon humanity.

There is more to the human body than its physical apparatus. This is widely evident in phenomenon such as near-death experiences, whereby people have had accounts of experiencing existence while their brain and body has been clinically dead.

However, while we are here physically, the spiritual components depend upon the physical apparatus in order to function properly and thereby communicate and actively participate in the physical world. When an important seat of consciousness such as the pineal gland cannot function properly, by logical extension, consciousness itself cannot function properly within us, since the physical means with which it functions in the world have been damaged.

Thus, it is not only that fluoride consumption has adverse health effects and reputedly makes people easier to control (as the Nazis believed), but the very spiritual essence of who we are, our consciousness, can be hindered from manifesting in our lives.

Within our consciousness are all the spiritual feelings such as love, peace, happiness, and freedom, as well as mystical experiences and psychic faculties.

The consciousness gives us the ability to be ""here,"" ""awake,"" and present psychologically.

There are sinister agents in the world and beyond who wish to see consciousness suppressed. There appears to be an evil behind water fluoridation that runs deeper than mere convenience, and the implications go beyond fluoride's reputed effects of making people compliant who would otherwise question questionable things (such as water fluoridation – the irony notwithstanding).

On the deepest level, it's about a person's individual ability to awaken consciousness and experience their full potential.

# How Do We Prevent Pineal Gland Calcification?

Eliminating exposure to fluoride is the #1 priority. 

We can start by being careful about surreptitious forms of fluoride in Teflon, foods, and beverages produced with municipal water, tap water, infant formula, fluoride-containing drugs like Prozac, toothpaste, etc.

We have collected a number of studies from the US National Library of Medicine on natural substances which mitigate **fluoride toxicity**.

We also have a section on our database dedicated to finding substances that prevent or reverse other forms of pathological calcification which may have relevance for pineal gland calcification, such as **ectopic calcification**.

Lastly, there is research on the potential value of magnesium and phytate in reducing **pineal gland calcification**.

That's nature's job!

Harmful toxins such as methane, carbon, aluminum, barium, sulfur, strontium, fluoride, mobile/ satellite radiation as well as biochemicals are either slowly or rapidly oppressing your consciousness and killing your precious body.

There is no way to avoid what is currently occurring since this is a globalist operative military warfare operation being conducted on ordinary civilians. Whether you are living rural, urban, town, city, or off the grid, the poison holds its omnipresence.

Chemtrails are a huge part of weakening, suppressing, and killing our minds, and bodies. During the **Narco wars** in the 1980s against drug cartels, several South American governments including Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil sprayed carcinogenic causing elements over forests and jungles where natives were living. They did use the **""War On Drugs""** as a ***deliberate excuse*** to do this on purpose. The government and military officials were strategically trying to push these natives who were living peacefully in their homes into cities and steal their land. Exactly what they're trying to do in the Western World.

**Vaccine Companies Investigated For Manslaughter**

Why it Makes No Sense to Give the Hepatitis B Vaccine to Newborns.  
Folks, let’s make one thing perfectly clear here, **hepatitis B is VERY difficult to catch**. You nearly always need to have blood or sexual contact of some sort with an infected carrier. That is why the main risk factors for hepatitis B are IV drug abusers and those who engage in sex with multiple partners.

This, of course, makes it nearly impossible for a newborn to contract hepatitis B unless his mother already has it.

Further, vaccine-derived immunity is thought to be short-lived, and between 30 percent to 50 percent of vaccinated individuals may lose their antibodies within seven years.

Meanwhile, up to 60 percent of people who initially respond will lose detectable antibodies within 12 years. So that means that by the time these newborns get to the age when they could potentially engage in the risky behaviors that would put them at risk of hepatitis B, their childhood vaccine will provide little to no protection.

The central nervous system of a newborn infant is also particularly susceptible to toxic influences. This is one of the reasons why the hepatitis B vaccine is such a problem. If it were given later in life, as is done in many other countries, it would not be as problematic.

Even so, this vaccine is still associated with numerous side effects, such as an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid diseases. 

**Do Your Homework Before Vaccinating: The Drug Companies Won’t do it For You**  
Aside from highlighting the extreme lack of common sense that goes along with vaccinating a newborn against a disease they have a rare chance of getting until they’re much older, this article points out, once again, that the drug companies are not on your side.

Their primary motivation is in making profits, and if that means covering up side effects to make you believe vaccination is safe, they will likely do it.

Remember, you do have the right to refuse vaccinations, and there are two basic axioms you should never forget.

* Nobody, anywhere or any time, and under any circumstances has the right or power in this country to immunize you or your children against your will and conviction. If they attempt to do so, you can legally charge them with ""assault with a deadly weapon"" and have the full resources of the law behind you.
* At all times in attempting to avoid unwanted immunization, you have the Law of the Land behind you. Those who would try to vaccinate you against your will are on very shaky ground. Into every compulsory immunization law in America are written legal exceptions and waivers, which are there specifically to protect you from the attempted tyranny of officialdom. It is not only your right but your obligation to use them if this is what your conscience tells you.

While all 50 states have immunization requirements, 28 allow parents to opt-out for medical or religious reasons. Another 20 states allow parents to opt-out for personal or philosophical reasons as well.

157,The Most Phenomenal Conspiracy of All: The Conspiracy of True Love,231.0,7e26ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e26ul/the_most_phenomenal_conspiracy_of_all_the/,57.0,1511114404.0,"Hi all. I wrote this post about 8 months ago on r/conspiracy, and it was well received. Based on where we're at today in terms of the collectively understood 'fallen' state of reality, I figured I'd leave you all with what I believe is the most phenomenal conspiracy of them all: the conspiracy of true love.

TL;DR: After going down the governmental rabbit hole, I’ve recognized how impactful the negative energy behind all these horrific realizations can be. I am hoping to alleviate the suffering, or the attachment to what we learn here. Because I firmly believe that, in order to combat this horror-drama time span in the universe’s narrative for humanity, we must remember true love. I know this sounds corny, but it’s more real than I think we initially assume. I apologize for the length — I tend to get personal so as to most effectively/honestly relate my thoughts to the reader. I’d also like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my personal thoughts. I promise that these are always written from an honest and passionate heart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, guys. I pop in here every so often to read what is going on in the world — or at least that which we are slowly exposed to despite it having gone on for a long, long time. And in recognizing how impactful some of this horrible news can be as you wake up to the truth behind the society in which we participate, I want to do whatever I can to alleviate the suffering that can come as a result of the learning we do here. Because the only way, I think, we’re going to overcome all of these traumatic realizations is that we come together with Love. Not the false love we’ve been introduced to for centuries — false love being the kind of ""love"" in which you love someone or something so that you can, in turn, receive love back — but the true love in which you love genuinely and selflessly. You love for nothing in return. You forget yourself and your own illusory ‘me’ world. Bear with me.

A year ago, I was depressed. I had no reason to be, other than my thoughts were telling me to be. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was suicide or stare my fears in the face. Fortunately, I chose to stare my fears in my face. In that moment, I recognized that my fears were illusory. They were attachments to some ‘thing’ in life, whether it was attaining an object and fearing not getting it or becoming a certain person and fearing not becoming it, or even fearing death through an attachment to this life of mine. These pressures needn’t exist because they fundamentally don’t exist. We create them. This ‘them’ is the ego. It is the illusion for which we think, a false center in consciousness, also called ‘me’.

Generally speaking, most individuals exist in very personal worlds that are separate from all else. We have our own problems, our own realities, our own individual chaotic maelstroms of desires and concerns. And because we’ve believed in the illusion of existing in a consciousness that is fundamentally separate from the world outside of us for so long, we’ve forgotten the most powerful and useful aspect of all of nature: everything is One, everything is related, and everything is Love. Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. We literally feel separate from the universe, when the universe is the mother out of which we become. 

Again, the universe is the mother out of which we become, yet we feel 'other than' the universe. Really seeing this truth can lead one to quite a hefty laugh, because it truly is a beautiful cosmic joke. People really believe that each of us comes into this world, when in truth, each of us comes *out of* the world. I always suggest that people read that last sentence slowly, so as to truly absorb its meaning, because that simple truth, itself, speaks volumes of the reasoning behind the chaotic reality which we currently have in front of us.

Fundamentally, we’ve forgotten love. Love has been substituted with artificial constructs (gadgets of technology, falsely loving someone in order to love yourself rather than loving someone selflessly, getting a better job, a better car, winning a war, finding a religion, and so on). I know this sounds hippy. I played college football and was raised in an all-American household. Hippy, flower-loving talk did not exist; it was foreign and rightfully so, I believed. But screw that. We can act like this isn’t true or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge that we’ve drifted from true love, forgive ourselves, and allow the magical process of self-healing to rubber band back to its origin of authentic love.

Here’s my concern. A year ago, I recognized the truth about how the world, which includes myself, had forgotten love. For a span of a few months, I experienced a sort of ineffable bliss in which I finally remembered true love and felt it for all things outside of my own self. Let me tell you something.. experiencing true love at all times of the day, which we can all do, is a hefty reminder as to why this whole ‘existing’ thing happens. The best way I can creatively describe that bliss is in this way: I am a musician and I love music more than anything. I uncontrollably cry when I hear a piano key being played at the most perfect time in unison with a violin. The magic I feel from music is ineffable. And when i rediscovered true love, everything I saw was being seen through the paradigm of that feeling I get from music. Everything was the same one song. It was all one verse, a UniVerse.

But once I’d become aware of politicians engaging in the *negative aspect* of spirituality (rather than positive; and for those of you who don't know, negative spirituality is the practice of focusing all intent on service to self rather than service to other), world-leaders being fake beauty queens with personal agendas, economies collapsing, climate change accelerating and showing signs of becoming even more relentless over the years to come, talk of extra-terrestrial life that’s been hidden from the public…I mean, so many mind-boggling happenings are being introduced to our minds. It’s overwhelming — at least it was to me. I admit that the negativity that has surfaced has brought me to the depths of hell. Myself, along with few others I’ve talked with, have unfortunately internalized the disgust so as to try and understand it. Well, I’m not sure it can be understood by any loving soul. It’s so, so foreign. So gross, so dirty, so sickly.

And if you’re on this forum, you likely care about humanity. I’d assume most of us are more sensitive people than others we might find elsewhere. Sensitive people feel compassion. And to be compassionate — to have an aware heart — and to know what’s really happening in the world while there are people walking around blind to the truth…that can have a massive impact. I, personally, have just wanted to cry and cry for months on end now. The emotional weight of this 180 degree turn that my understanding of reality has taken was, at one point, unbearable. But this is why I wrote to you all today.

What I’ve learned throughout the past year in solitude is that life seems to suck right now for the collective, but it needn’t be that way and it will not forever. That’s why change is happening now and the universe is going through a shedding of its skin, bringing to light unfathomable evil in the process. But the unfathomable evil, which we’ve been veiled from knowing for so long, can instill in any sensitive person some pretty massive confusion, disgust, and suffering. This is what we need to be aware of.

The more we suffer, the more ‘they’ win. Be aware of that and make a point of it. Each loving act you do has an impact. Every moment you take to genuinely love anyone, a family member, a coworker, a stranger…it makes a difference in this Matrix. And as all this information is exposed, we can either respond as awake people and culminate massive love as a response. Or we can fall victim to the unveiling horrors and helplessly fall down an even darker path before the universe sympathetically takes a U-turn.

Think about this: when you do something good for someone else and have no expectation of what you’ll receive in return, how god damn awesome does it feel when you see that person’s face light up after you’ve been kind? When you expect absolutely nothing in return, you can’t be let down. And when you can’t be let down and are living with authentic and real love — not that fake love crap we’ve been raised to believe is real — but the real stuff, selfless love…that’s when magic happens. That’s when you remember who you really are and what life is all about. That’s when you look your loved ones in the eyes again and remember that magnetic pull you feel from their heart to yours. You love again. You live again. The darkness has no ability to penetrate that authentic love. It’s the most powerful emotional manifestation of the universe that we can experience. And in order to be invincible and overcome this revealing period of turmoil, we must remember true love and tap into that deep, deep sense of oneness which we can all experience perpetually so long as we remain selfless and put our own agendas aside. Such a thing is hard to fathom in modern society when we’ve been raised to ‘be the best’ but we’re remembering who and what we are and that we’ve drifted from the truth. Thus, I believe our personal agendas are either going to fall apart and crumble as the universe has a plan to reintroduce humanity to what’s meaningful and worth giving our attention to, particularly right now, or we can make the choice to remember true love on our own.

Loving is the easiest thing to do once you forget your own agenda. I love you guys. I know that each of you is simply a ‘different’ manifestation of what I really am, and vice versa. Now, let’s all start living that way. Let’s live as One. For those of you who tend to misread my message and PM me to get out of here with my NWO preaching, I’m not speaking in the sense of One government, but in the sense of universal lovingness. A world in which we realize that everything is related and is made of the same stuff. Where no one is judged and everyone is celebrated. Where everyone’s intention is for the benefit of others and not for the benefit of self. Where, when we let go of our passionate attachment to our own individual beliefs and open up to a beautiful state of selfless openness, we finally witness that a human being's most fundamentally natural state of being is one in which no fear can exist, because there is nothing to lose when you are literally a conscious manifestation of the entire game of life. *That* is where we will win.",conspiracy,climate change
158,"MMRV vaccine (Priorix Tetra) analyzed by independent lab, found to contain retroviruses associated with malignant tumors of the testes and prostate cancer",227.0,bgexag,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bgexag/mmrv_vaccine_priorix_tetra_analyzed_by/,302.0,1556016503.0,"Quick info/meme - https://i.imgur.com/OmI6iQl.png

Full story - Independent researchers in Italy have been analyzing a number of vaccines, looking to see if they contain the necessary antigens, while also checking for contamination.  Big Pharma and their puppets aren't happy about this, as potentially there will be serious repercussions for them, depending on what is found in the vaccines.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07464-0

The latest one they've looked into is the MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Chicken Pox) vaccine (Priorix Tetra), in which they found 3 out of the 4 attenuated viruses, over 100 chemical contaminants, human fetal DNA, microbial contamination and last but not least retroviruses associated with malignant tumors of the testes and prostate cancer.

What did we find in the MMRV (Priorix Tetra) vaccine? 
https://www.corvelva.it/en/speciale-corvelva/vaccinegate-en/what-did-we-find-in-the-mmrv-priorix-tetra-vaccine.html

There are so many problems, and each lot of vaccines was different, some having more contamination than others.  One particular disturbing find is the human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) or Human teratocarcinoma-derived virus (HDTV), they a family of human endogenous retroviruses associated with malignant tumors of the testes and prostate cancer. (see studies below)

Detection of Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705622/

Demystified . . . Human endogenous retroviruses
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1187282/

So once again, as we have [seen in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uGWut6IRfA), whether deliberate or accidental, vaccines are spreading viruses which cause cancer, sowing the seeds of disease, thereby sowing the seeds of future industry profit, as the pharmaceuticals make a fortune from every cancer patient.  It's all along the same lines as what polio vaccine developer [Salk admitted in his book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09unra20ZM), these people want to inject us all with cancer viruses so as to bring the population down and thereby reduce pollution, so vaccines are like the pesticide which gets used on humans, we are the pests.  Many of you will be aware that Bill Gates admitted on camera that [vaccines are to bring the population down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQtRI7A064) to reduce climate change.

Worth noting also that the viruses they want to vaccinate us against, like mumps for example, if a female catches mumps it will leave her immune to ovarian cancer, essentially upgrading her immune system.  (study below)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/

So vaccines are not only spreading cancer-causing viruses, but also taking away the opportunity for our immune systems to learn how to prevent cancer.  And all for such mild and normally harmless short-term childhood viruses which we are fear-mongered about daily. Pharma want us to trade them in for cancer, as cancer makes serious money compared to a [mild virus which kills only 1 in 10,000](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/dis/).  They want everyone injected with a cancer which will become active at some point in their life, likely when their immune system is suppressed.

It is clear why the industry doesn't like any kind of real research being performed on vaccines, we are told they should not be questioned as they are sacred, in the same way as we were told it is unpatriotic to question 9/11.",conspiracy,climate change

With them being recently destroyed, I thought it would be a good time to go down this rabbit hole. 

https://youtu.be/AEa3sK1iZxc

Let’s start with the low level understanding that John Oliver produced recently. Towards the end of this video he states that Dr. Herbert Kersten commissioned the stones under the name RC Christian. That name will become important later. John says that Kersten was a doctor but also a Eugenicist that supported David duke. This is true but it does not go deep enough into what he was about. 

So let’s go a bit deeper into his name that he signed, RC Christian.  

https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/4275998-common-sense-renewed

Here is a book published around the same time as the stones. You might notice that the book is written by Robert Christian. Many people think this book was published by the same man, but that isn’t entirely clear. What is clear is that this book was written by the same organization, and I will explain that completely. 

Robert Christian and many other variations of RC is related to the rosicrucian order. Or order of the Rosy Cross. They basically worship a dead man they call father RC. The variations of RC are a signal to others that they are the order of the Rosy cross. This might not seem important until you understand how they recruit for the order. For those interested in cyphers and secret codes, this is where it gets really interesting.

https://youtu.be/tNL0XODSMwU

I would highly suggest watching this documentary about the hidden code in Shakespeare to understand more about the organization. It goes deep into the Cyphers and secret code hidden in Shakespeare’s text and makes a great claim that the book was written by Rosicrucians and that Shakespeare was not a real writer. Instead it was most likely written by Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Henry Neville who absolutely were Rosicrucians. In fact Sir Francis Bacon may have been the highest up in the order at the time. He also killed my ancestor but that’s a story for another day. This documentary will show you how the Rosicrucians recruit and show how they may have been the ones who stashed ancient Christian relics from the crusades on oak island. Trust me it gets really deep.

Also one last thing because I have gone much deeper into their organization personally. I know that they believe that catastrophic Climate change will destroy the world. They are the ones who pioneered that over population is the problem and egenics was the solution. Many people consider it to be a Satanic cabal that runs the country and global institutions. I disagree a little bit. What I call them is Luciferians. Meaning that they worship the essential qualities of Lucifer found in many esoteric texts. In very short terms I would say that they worship them selves and believe that they can ascend to godhood. These men have always believed that they are better than everyone else. They believe they are chosen. Unfortunately I think them and many other groups have been pulling the strings for a long time. Happy searching, I hope you enjoy this rabbit hole as much as I do.",conspiracy,climate change

Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a giant scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”

According to Gates, who was speaking to an audience of his inner circle in 2018, wind, solar, battery technology and other renewable energy sources might be fashionable, but they are NOT capable of solving climate change.

As you can see in the video footage, the fact that renewable energy is not actually capable of solving climate change, despite being sold to us as the cure for so-called man made global warming, is hysterically funny for Bill Gates.

Why does he find it so funny? Perhaps because he is making a fortune out of these so-called “clean energy” sources and capitalizing on the gullible masses with their “screwed up minds.”

Damning stuff from the father of clean energy himself.

So now that we have Gates on record admitting clean energy is a scam, how does the unelected world health czar defend his plans to force people to stop eating meat and start consuming his fake meat?",conspiracy,climate change

This is a part of the ""Great Reset"" agenda.

How they will make you own nothing? for a portion of the population it will be easy - those who don't own much yet, are being priced out of ever being able to own.

How about those who already own their own house and other things, and have a certain lifestyle (that they worked very hard to achieve) etc.. ?

Well here comes in the strategy of financial terrorism - with the help of artificially made super high inflation, even those who already have some things, in the long run will have to downsize (e.g. sell..), in order to be able to keep their families fed or having a roof under their heads.

Even if you are considered a ""well off"" middle class family, both parents are working hard and managed to buy a house and own two cars, your children go to good schools, have decent food in your fridge and are able to crunch in a yearly vacation or two - with the ""help"" of inflation, even that can be taken away from you bit by bit.

If your monthly expenses are raising constantly every month, into levels where you pay hundreds euros/dollars more without increasing your spending habits, it's just a matter of time (sometimes even a few months!) until it will start hurting, until you will find out that suddenly from having some disposable income after all monthly expenses, you have gone into having an empty bank account in the middle of the month - and without you doing any additional spending! and all while large corporations are reporting the highest profits they have had in decades, and your government stealing your children's future by sending tens of billions of tax payer money to fuel politician-driven wars overseas to advance their own goals and enrich their crony friends.

If we don't stop this artificial hell, we are all done! and at the end, we will indeed get to a point where we are unable to own nothing! and who will own everything? the same fraudsters who were behind this massive dystopian scam.

How to fight the wealth theft (inflation) ? I don't know if we can get rid of it, but we can fight it - by trying to find ways to make some additional income that is not dependent on an employer (small side business, side hustles etc..), and by trying to be a bit more self sufficient (maybe plant a small garden so a portion of your veggies and fruits will be cheap and at your disposal? collect rain water to avoid large water bills when watering said garden, etc.. maintain a pantry with enough shelf stable food for at least a month including drinking water for your size of family, make sure to have an alternative heating source for your home, and a small camping stove or similar, for those who can afford - install solar and make sure it's an off-grid installation which means the stored energy is usable on power outages)",conspiracy,climate change

And in order to get here, we will start there. 

9-11 happened. Most of the planet mistakenly understood terrorists had struck a blow against Freedom and Capitalism and Democracy. It was time to invade Afghanistan. Yet all of the terrorists were linked to Saudi Arabia and not Afghanistan, that didn't make sense either. Yet they invaded to find Bin Laden, an ex CIA asset against the Soviet Union and it's subjugation of Afghanistan. The land in the middle of nowhere in relation to North America and the West. It was barren. A backwater without any strategic importance or natural resources. 

Or was there?

The survey for rare earth elements was only made possible by the 2001 U.S. invasion, with work beginning in 2004. Mirzad says the Russians had already done significant surveying work during their military occupation of the country in the 1980s. Mirzad also toes the line for U.S. corporations, arguing, “The Afghan government should not touch the mining business. We have to give enough information to potential investors.”

Rare Earth Elements. The elements that make the information age possible. People could understand the First Gulf War and the Geopolitical importance of oil. That was easy, but it still didn't sound morally just to have a war for oil. It was too imperialist and so they fell in line and supported a war for Kuwaiti freedom instead, despite the obvious and public manipulation at the UN by Nayirah. 

This is some of her testimony to the Human Rights Council. 

While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It was horrifying. I could not help but think of my nephew who was born premature and might have died that day as well. After I left the hospital, some of my friends and I distributed flyers condemning the Iraqi invasion until we were warned we might be killed if the Iraqis saw us.

The Iraqis have destroyed everything in Kuwait. They stripped the supermarkets of food, the pharmacies of medicine, the factories of medical supplies, ransacked their houses and tortured neighbors and friends.

There was only one problem. She was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign, which was run by the American public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government (fun fact, Hill & Knowlton also have extensive ties with Bill Gates). 

So the public was aghast at her testimony and supported the war against the mainly Soviet backed, but also American supported and Soviet backed Saddam Hussein, in his war against Iran, after the Iranians refused to Ally with American interests after the Islamic Revolution. 

But that was oil, this was Rare Earth Elements. There was a reason the war was called, Operation Enduring Freedom. This natural resource was far more important in the long run. You couldn't have a security surveillance apparatus without it. And what was supposed to be a war on terror was in actuality a territorial occupation for resources. 

Sleeping Dragon China is next, and where there's smoke, there's fire. 

Let's go point form for clarity. 

• China entered the rare earth market in the mid-1980s, at a time when the US was the major producer. But China soon caught up and became the production leader for rare earths. Its heavily state-supported strategy was aimed at dominating the global rare earth industry.

``We had clients asking to be pulled out of money market funds and wanting to get into Treasuries,'' said Henley Smith, fixed-income manager in New York at Castleton Partners, which oversees about $150 million in bonds. ``People are buying T-bills because you know exactly what's in it.'' 

• February 13, 2008.
The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was enacted, which included a tax rebate. The total cost of this bill was projected at $152 billion for 2008. A December 2009 study found that only about one-third of the tax rebate was spent, providing only a modest amount of stimulus.

Outside of China, the US is the second largest consumer of rare earths in the world behind Japan. 

About 60% of US rare earth imports are used as catalysts for petroleum refining, making it the country’s major consumer of rare earths.

The US military also depends on rare earths. Many of the most advanced US weapon systems, including smart bombs, unmanned drones, cruise missiles, laser targeting, radar systems and the Joint Strike Fighter programme rely on rare earths. Against this background, the US Department of Defense (DoD) stated that “reliable access to the necessary material is a bedrock requirement for DOD”

Beijing also demands that those outlets, as well as TIME and Voice of America, share information with the government about their operations in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says the moves are in response to the U.S. government’s decision earlier in the year to limit the number of Chinese journalists from five state-run media outlets in the United States to 100, down from 160, and designate those outlets as foreign missions.

And here we are. You may have noticed the Rare Earth Elements and the inclusion of Environmental Standards. Yes these are key to understanding the Geopolitical reality and importance of these events. There's a reason the one child policy stopped. Troop additions. 

I believe our current political reality started at Tiananmen square. The protests were an American sponsored attempt at regime change after the failure to convince them to leave totalitarian communism and join a greater political framework. 

Do I have proof? Yes. 

China, as far as I'm concerned, was responsible for the 2008 economic crisis. The Rare Earth Elements were an attempt to weaken the States and strengthen themselves simultaneously. This stranglehold either forced America to trade with China, or the trade was an American Trojan horse to eventually collapse their economy and cause a revolution after Tiananmen Square failed. Does my second proposal sound far fetched? Didn't the economy just shut down in response to the epidemic? Aren't both sides blaming the other? At this POINT, the epidemic seems to be overstated doesn’t it? Don't the casualties tend to the elder demographic and those already weakened by a primary disease?

Exactly the kinds who wouldn't fight in a war. 

Does this change some of my views on the possibility of upcoming catastrophes and reasons for certain events? No. This is Chess, and there are obvious moves in chess, hidden moves in chess, but the best moves involve peices which can be utilized in different ways if the board calls for it. 

Is all what it seems? No. 

I definitely changed a few previously held beliefs prior to today, and I would caution you in advance that you will find some previously held convictions challenged. 

After uncovering what I did today, I would also strongly suggest reading information cautiously. This is all merely a culmination of ending the cold war, and once I have events laid out, you will see it as well. 

At this moment, the end analysis is a war will start in the near future. This will be mainly for a few reasons, preemptive resource control for water and crops, population reduction can be achieved since we have too many people, not enough jobs, and upcoming resource scarcity. 

Did you notice my omission of rare earth elements? This is because of Afghanistan. I would wager China or Russia is somehow supporting the continued resistance through Iran. But events are now accelerating with China because the western collation has already begun to build up their mines and start production. 

Do you remember when Trump made a ""joke"" about buying Greenland? Yeah. It turns out that Greenland has one of the largest rare earth mineral deposits on the planet.

**Karl Haushofer** founded, before 1919, a second order, the Brothers of the Light, which later took the name of the Vril Society. In this were united also the Masters of the Black Stone (DHvSS), a new founding of the Templars, from the order of Germain in 1917, and the Black Knights of the Black Sun, the élite of the Thule Society and the SS.

If we compare the Vril Society to the Thule Society, the difference can be summarized thus:

* the Thule Society occupied itself with material and political matters
* the Vril Society was concerned above all with the beyond

However, they had some points in common.

Both studied Atlantis, Thule, the Island of the Fortunate of Gilgamesh, the original relationships between the Germans and the Mesopotamians as well as the ancient sanctuaries like Stonehenge with its towering stones.

In December 1919, a forest house was rented in the Ramsau, near Berchtesgaden, where some people from the Thule, DHvSS, and Vril Societies met. Among them were the mediums Maria Orsitsch and Sigrun. Maria had received some information in a secret script of the Templars - a language completely unknown to her - with technical data on constructing a flying machine.

These telepathic messages were transmitted, according to the written records of the Vril Society, from the solar system of Aldebaran, in the constellation of Taurus.

We wish to present to you a summary of the messages which were received for some years by the Vril Society telepaths, which were the basis of the further actions taken by that Society.

# Aldebaran

The solar system of Aldebaran is 68 light-years from Earth and two inhabited planets which constitute the Realm of Sumerian orbit around their sun.

The inhabitants of this solar system are subdivided into masters, White God-like people (Aryans), and other different human races. These latter developed because of climatic changes on the individual planets and were the result of a degeneration of the God-like people. These mutants came to have a spiritual development inferior to the God-like people.

The more the races mixed together, the more their spiritual development was degraded. Consequently, when the sun (Aldebaran) began to expand, they were no longer able to make interplanetary voyages like their ancestors; it had become impossible for them to leave their planets.

Thus the inferior races, totally dependent on the masters, came to be evacuated in spaceships and taken to other habitable planets. In spite of the differences, there was respect between these two races, they did not encroach upon each other’s living space (in contrast to Earth).

The race of the masters, the White God-like people, had started to colonize other planets similar to Earth 500 million years ago, following the expansion of the Aldebaran sun and the growing heat resulting from it, which made the planets uninhabitable. It was said that they colonized the planet Mallona (also called Maldek, Marduk, or Phaeton by the Russians) in our solar system, which existed at that time between Mars and Jupiter, where the asteroids are found today.

After that, Mars, of which the great pyramid cities and the well-known Martian face, photographed in 1976 by the Viking probe, bear witness to the high level of development of its inhabitants. From there, in that era, it was assumed that the God-like people of Sumerian Aldebaran came to Earth for the first time.

Old traces of a petrified shoe about 500 million years old, with a trilobite petrified together with the sole of that shoe, bear witness to it. That primitive fish lived on Earth then and disappeared 400 million years ago.

The Vril Society members thought that the Aldebaranians landed later on, when the Earth became slowly habitable, in Mesopotamia, and that they formed the dominant caste of the Sumerians. These Aldebaranians were called White God-people. Moreover, the Vril telepaths received the following information: the Sumerian language was not only identical to that of the Aldebaranians, but it also had tones similar to German, and the frequency of the two languages was almost identical.

Does this correspond with reality? Let us say simply that the construction drawings and the technical data received by the telepaths - no matter where they came from - were so precise that the most fantastic idea ever conceived by man was born: the building of a machine for flight to the beyond! The concept of an ""other science"" mentally matured (today one would use the term ""alternative forms of energy"").

It was three years before the project got underway. In that first phase of an ""other technology"" or an ""other science"" Dr. **W. O. Schumann**, a member of the Thule and Vril Societies, gave a lecture at the Faculty of Science in Munich.

# Here is an extract

Everywhere, two principles determine events: light and darkness, good and bad, creation and destruction, like the positive and negative in electricity. It is always Either - Or!

>These two principles, designated concretely as creative and destructive principles, also determine our technological methods.The destructive principle is the work of Satan, the creative principle is the work of God.All technology based on the principle of explosion or of combustion may be called satanic technology. The coming New Age will be the age of a new technology, positive and divine!**(extract from the secret archives of the SS).**

# Implosion Technology

[ Viktor Schauberger ](https://preview.redd.it/y3ggcs0f5cs81.jpg?width=150&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e2a2250c6d4271d4c29bdd0e5717ea0372e7ae5)

At the same time, the scientist Viktor Schauberger was working on a similar project.

He was using the teaching of Johannes Kepler who was in possession of the secret doctrine of the Pythagoreans, held and kept secret by the Templars. This concerned knowledge of implosion (in this case, meaning the utilization of the potential of inner worlds in the outer world.

Hitler and all the other members of the Thule and Vril Societies knew that the divine principle is always creative, that is to say, constructive. A technology that, by contrast, relies on explosion is therefore destructive, as opposed to the divine principle. So one would wish to create a technology relying on implosion.

Schauberger’s oscillation teachings (the principle of the harmonic series = monotone) are part of the understanding of implosion. Put it very simply: implosion instead of explosion!

By means of the energy trajectories of the monotone and implosion technology, one can penetrate into the domain of antimatter and in this way, one can dissolve gravity.

# Saucer-shaped craft

[UFO Blue Print](https://i.redd.it/99jpaquj5cs81.gif)

The first saucer-shaped craft was built in the summer of 1922, its drive based on implosion technology (the machine for flight to the beyond).

It consisted of a disc of 8m diameter, surmounted by a parallel disc of 6.5m diameter, with another disc of 6m diameter underneath. These three discs had a hole of 1.80m through their centers, where the 2.40m high propulsion unit was mounted. At the base, the central body terminated in the form of a cone. In this cone was a kind of pendulum for stabilization of the device.

The lower and upper discs turned in opposite directions to create a rotating electromagnetic field.

The performance of this first flying disc is unknown. It was experimented on for two years before being dismantled and stored at the Messerschmidt works at Augsburg. The financing for this project can be found in the accounts of several industrial companies, mentioned under the code JFM. It is certain that the Vril mechanism is descended from the machine for flight to the beyond but it has been indexed as the Schumann SM levitator.

In principle, the machine for flight to the beyond had to engender an extremely strong field around itself and its immediate vicinity which made all of the surrounding space, comprising that of the machine and its occupants, a microcosm completely independent from our cosmos.

At its maximum power, this field would be completely independent of all the forces and influences of our Universe, such as gravitation, electromagnetism, radiation, as well as any kind of matter. It could move at will in any gravitational field without one sensing it, or feeling forces of acceleration.

In June 1934, Viktor Schauberger was invited by Hitler and the highest representatives of the Vril and Thule societies and worked, from then on, with them. The first German UFO was developed in June 1934. Under the direction of Dr. W. O. Schumann, the first experimental circular aircraft RFZ 1 was developed at the Arado aircraft factory in Brandenburg.

Even though its first flight was also it's last, it rose vertically to a height of about 60m but then started to tumble and dance in the air for several minutes.

The Arado 196 tail unit which was supposed to guide the device proved to be completely ineffective. With great difficulty the pilot Lothar Waiz succeeded in bringing it back to the ground, escaping from it, and getting away in time, because the device started to spin like a top before it overturned and completely broke into pieces. That was the end of the RFZ 1 but the beginning of the VRIL flying machines.

The RFZ 2 was finished at the end of 1934, it had a Vril drive and a magnetic impulsion flying system. Its diameter was 5m and had the following characteristics: the contours of the device became blurred as it gained speed, and it lit up with different colors, a well-known characteristic of UFOs.

Depending on the propulsive force, it became red, orange, yellow, green, white, blue, or violet. It was able to operate, and it had a remarkable destiny in the year 1941. It was used as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft during the battle of England.

The standard German ME 109 fighters had proved themselves unfit for transatlantic reconnaissance flights because of their short range.

It was photographed at the end of 1941 over the south Atlantic while on the way to the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis which was in Antarctic waters. It could not be used as a fighter aircraft for the following reason: because of its impulsion flying system, the RFZ 2 could only make changes in direction of 90º, 45º, or 22.5º. Unbelievable, some of you will think, but it is exactly these right-angle flight changes that are characteristic of UFOs.

After the success of the small RFZ 2 as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft, the Vril Society acquired its own testing ground in Brandenburg. The VRIL 1 Hunter, a lightly armed flying disc, flew at the end of 1942. It was 11.5m in diameter, had a single seat, and it had a Schumann levitation drive and a magnetic field impulsion flying system.

It reached speeds of 2900 to 12,000 km/h, could accomplish right angle direction changes at full speed without harming the pilot, was unaffected by the weather, and was perfectly capable of spaceflight. Seventeen examples of the VRIL 1 were built, there were also several variants with two seats, equipped with glass domes.

At the same time, a V-7 project was developed. Several flying discs carried this name but they had conventional jet propulsion. According to Adreas Epp, the RFZ 7 was created, which combined a levitating flying disc with jet propulsion.

The firms of Schriever-Habermohl and Miethe Belluzo worked on it. It was 42m in diameter but it crashed while landing in Spitzbergen. Later, however, an RFZ 7 built in the same way was photographed outside Prague.

According to **Andreas Epp**, it was to be equipped with nuclear warheads to bomb New York.

[Nuclear Warhead Print](https://i.redd.it/z8t5c5ww5cs81.gif)

In July 1941, Schriever and Habermohl built a circular aircraft that took off vertically, with jet propulsion, but which had, however, some severe deficiencies.

However, another electro gravitational flying spinning-top with a tachyon drive was developed which was more successful. Then came the RFZ 7 T, built by Schriever, Habermohl, and Belluzo, which was fully functional. However, compared to the Vril and Haunebu discs, the V-7 flying discs were children’s toys.

Within the SS there was a group working on the production of alternative energy: the Research Group IV of the Black Sun SS-E-IV whose main objective was to make Germany independent of foreign crude oil.

The SS-E-IV developed the Thule mechanism, later called the **Thule Tachyonator** from the Vril mechanism and from the tachyon converter of Captain Hans Coler.

In August 1939 the first RFZ 5 took off. It was a fairly heavily armed flying spinning-top with the strange name Haunebu 1.

It had a crew of eight men, measured 25m in diameter, at first reaching a speed of 4800 km/h, and later, up to 17,000 km/h. It was equipped with two long-range 60mm cannons (KSK) mounted in rotating turrets, and four MK 106s and had a moderate ability for spaceflight.

At the end of 1942, the Haunebu II was likewise ready. Its diameter varied from 26 to 32m, its height was from 9 to 11m.

It could transport a crew of 9 to 20 persons. Driven by a *Thule Tachyonator*, it reached 6000 km/h in the periphery of Earth. It was suitable for spaceflight and had a range of 55 flying hours. Plans already existed for the large 120m diameter spacecraft Vril 7, able to transport entire companies.

Shortly afterward, the 71m diameter Haunebu III was constructed, the most splendid example of all.

It flew and was even filmed. It could transport 32 persons, its flight duration was more than eight weeks and it reached a speed of at least 7000 km/h (and according to documents from the secret archives of the SS, it could reach 40,000 km/h).

Virgil Armstrong, ex-member of the CIA and former Green Beret, states that German flying machines during World War 2 could land and take off vertically and fly at right angles. They reached 3000 km/h and were armed with laser cannons (probably the KSK, a long-range cannon) which could penetrate 4-inch thick armor plating.

Professor **J. J. Hurtak**, urologist and author of The Keys of Enoch said that the Germans were in the process of constructing what the Allies designated miracle weapons systems.

Hurtak had in his hand documents mentioning.

1. the construction of Peenemünde, a city for experimentation with machines teleguided into space.2. the bringing together of the best German technicians and scientists These documents also mentioned the existence of the so-called foo fighters (balls of fire).

The CIA and the British Secret Services already knew, in 1942, of the construction and deployment of such flying objects, but they did not appreciate their true merit.

In fact, the Allies designated under the name foo fighters all kinds of luminous German flying craft. Two inventions correspond particularly to what was called foo fighters: the ""flying turtles"" and the ""soap bubbles.""

The two had nothing to do with each other, but the Allies wrongly associated them. The ""flying turtle"" was conceived by the research group SS-E-IV at Wiener Neustadt. Its shape was reminiscent of a turtle’s shell. It was an unmanned flying probe that would upset the electrical ignition systems of enemy armaments. This probe was also equipped with sophisticated weapons, Klystron tubes called death rays by the SS. But this sabotage by cutting off ignition did not work perfectly at first. Development of this technique continued later.

Anyone who has already seen a UFO can confirm that this ignition cutting, i.e. the shutting down of electrical systems, is one of the typical characteristics of UFOs when they appear.

Wendell C. Stevens, a US Air Force pilot during World War 2 said that the foo fighters were sometimes grey-green or red-orange, that they approached up to 5m from the aircraft, and that they stayed in that position. It was not possible to get rid of them, even when shot at from underneath, and sometimes the flights were obliged to turn back or to land.

As for the ""soap bubbles"" often called foo fighters, these were in fact simple balloons, in the interior of which were fine metal spirals to jam the radars of the enemy aircraft. Their effectiveness was probably minimal, apart from psychological intimidation.

At the beginning of 1943, planning began for a spaceship in the shape of a cigar, the Andromeda craft (click below image), which was to be built at the Zeppelin works (139m long).

It would transport several saucer-shaped spacecraft for interstellar long-duration flights.

&#x200B;

[Andromeda Interstellar Craft](https://i.redd.it/x71jo2617cs81.gif)

An important meeting of the Vril Society took place around Christmas 1943 at Kolberg, a seaside resort by the North Sea, which the mediums Maria and Sigrun attended.

The principal subject was the Aldebaran Enterprise. The mediums had received precise information about the inhabited planets orbiting the Aldebaran sun, and a voyage was planned to go there. On 2 January 1944, Hitler, Himmler, Künkel, and Dr. Schumann (both of the Vril Society) met to talk about this Vril project. They wished to travel by means of a large spacecraft, the Vril 7 (click image left), to Aldebaran, through a dimensional channel.

According to Ratthofer, the first test flight in a dimensional channel took place in winter 1944. The craft must have avoided a disaster by a narrow margin because from photos of the Vril 7 taken after its return, it looked as though it had been traveling for a century.

The exterior surface of the cabins appeared very worn and there was damage in many places.

On 14 February 1944, the test pilot Joachim Roehlike test flew at Peenemünde the supersonic helicopter built by Schriever and Habermohl under the name of project V 7 which was fitted with twelve BMW 028 turboprop engines. Its speed in the vertical climb was 800m per minute, it reached a height of 24,200m and its speed in horizontal flight was 2200 km/h.

It could also be propelled by nonconventional energy. However, it could never be used, because Peenemünde was bombed in 1944 and its transfer to Prague proved to be of no use since that city was occupied by the Americans and the Russians well before the flying discs could be used.

When they occupied Germany at the beginning of 1945, the British and the Americans discovered in the secret archives of the SS, among other things, photos of the Haunebu II and the Vril I as well as the Andromeda craft.

In March 1946 President Truman acted so that the Naval command of the USA gave permission to collect German material in order to experiment with this high technology. Under Operation Paperclip German scientists were brought secretly to the USA. Among then were Viktor Schauberger and Wernher von Braun.

Here we summarize briefly the developments which should be given in a series:

>The first project was carried out under the direction of Professor Dr W. O. Schumann of the Faculty of Science at Munich. In this project, up to the beginning of 1945, 17 flying discs of 11.5m diameter were allegedly constructed, which accomplished 84 flight tests, the so-called Vril 1 Hunters.

In April 1945, at least a Vril-7 and a large Vril-7 named Odin took off from Brandenburg for Aldebaran, after the entire test area had been blown up, taking a group of Vril scientists and Vril lodge members. The second project was led by the Research Group IV of the SS who had constructed, up to the beginning of 1945, three types of space-going bell-shaped spinning-tops of different sizes:

The Haunebu I, 25m in diameter, in two examples, tested 50 times (flight speed about 4800 km/h).

The Haunebu II, 32m in diameter, in seven examples, tested 100 times (flight speed about 6000 km/h). The Haunebu II was in fact intended for series production. A tender was let to the aircraft companies Dornier and Junkers. At the end of March 1945, Dornier landed the contract. The official designation of these heavy flying spinning-tops should be DOSTRA (Dornier Stratospheric Aircraft).

The Haunebu III, 71m in diameter, in only one example, flew at least 19 times (flight speed about 7000 km/h).

There were plans for the Andromeda craft (see above image), a 139m spaceship that could contain one Haunebu II, two Vril I’s, and two Vril II’s.

Furthermore, there are documents attesting that the large version of the Vril-7 was finished at the end of 1944, and after testing, it made several flights within the Earth’s orbit, which were kept secret:

1. Landing near the Mondsee lake in the Salzkammergut with diving tests to pressure-test the fuselage.2. From March to April 1945 the Vril-7 was probably stationed at the Alpine Fortress for security and strategic reasons. From there, it took off for Spain where important personalities of the Reich had fled as refugees, to take them to South America and to Neuschwabenland and to keep them secure in secret bases that the Germans had constructed there during the war.3. Immediately afterward, the Vril-7 is supposed to have made a secret flight to Japan, but nothing more is known about it. What happened to these spaceships after the war? The production of the Haunebu II in a very small series cannot be excluded. Different photos of UFOs whose construction, after 1945, showed a typically German appearance, suggest this possibility.

Some say that some of these machines would have been sunk in the Mondsee lake in upper Austria, others think that they would have been taken to South America, or that they were transported there in pieces. It is certain that even if they were not necessarily taken to South America, new devices were built there from construction drawings.

They were flown, and an important part of this technology was used in 1983 in the Phoenix Experiment, preceded by the Philadelphia Experiment of 1943.

(This concerned US Naval experiments on teleportation, materialization and time travel which were more successful than anyone would have imagined in their wildest dreams. There is enough material here for another book, but that would divert us from our subject. See the bibliography).

In 1938 a German expedition to the Antarctic took place, led by the aircraft carrier Schwabenland.

The Germans claimed 600,000 square kilometers of territory which they named Neuschwabenland. It was a region free of ice, with mountains and lakes. Later, entire fleets of type 21 and 23 submarines traveled to Neuschwabenland. To this day, more than a hundred German submarines are missing.

[German Military Technology](https://preview.redd.it/bfp52trk7cs81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=da86221c5f9799933eaae8ccd65e362c4d478551)

Among other things, they were equipped with the Walter snorkel which enabled them to remain submerged for several weeks.

One may suppose that they went to Neuschwabenland with flying discs in separate pieces, or at least with the construction drawings.

One may suppose also since the test flights were successful, that directly after the end of the war the flying discs were produced there. This supposition may appear daring, but many important indicators allow us to imagine that this is what happened.

The question arises: Why did the Allies under Admiral E. Byrd invade the Antarctic in 1947? If it was only an expedition, why did Byrd have at his disposal 4000 soldiers, a warship, a fully equipped aircraft carrier, and a full re-supply system?

He had eight months available, however, he was forced to withdraw after eight weeks, after having suffered large losses of aircraft. The exact number was never made public. What had happened? Admiral Byrd later explained to the press:

>""It is bitter to realize that in the case of a new war we will have to cope with the attacks of aircraft which can fly from one pole to the other.""

He also let it be known that there was an advanced civilization down there that, together with the SS, was served by advanced technology.

In his book Time Machines where he asks, among other things, what happened to the Haunebu, Norbert Jürgen-Ratthofer writes:

>From May 1945, the Haunebu I, II and III space-going spinning-tops and even the Vril 1 space-going flying discs disappeared, at first without trace.

In this context, it is extremely interesting to know that the Haunebu III of the German Reich, after its nineteenth test flight, was flown on a space expedition to Mars, taking off on 20 April 1945 from Neuschwabenland which was officially at that time an immense territory of the German Reich in East Antarctica.

What resulted, we do not know.

[German UFO In Antartica](https://preview.redd.it/8nl7jq0n7cs81.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16c9477f16862e286676677fd1c38b8849621f04)

A year later, in 1946, innumerable luminous objects of unknown but obviously artificial origin were seen above Scandinavia, provoking great agitation amongst the Allies in the East as in the West.

Another year later, in 1947, and continuing into the 1950s, a constantly rising number of luminous flying objects suddenly appeared above North America. Certainly, they were piloted by intelligent beings, most often they were round, disc, or bell-shaped. There were also sometimes unidentified flying objects in the shape of cigars. There are writers who say that usually, these UFOs do not resemble those made by the German Reich.

Well-documented photographic material proves that particularly the Haunebu II version was seen, and even very often, since 1945.

If you have become interested in the technical world of UFOs you will be able to verify that among the cases where there has been personal contact with UFO occupants, there is a particularly high percentage of very attractive beings of the Aryan race, blond with blue eyes, who spoke either fluent German or another language with a German accent (for insiders we mention the cases of Adamski in 1952, Cedric Allingham in 1954, and Howard Menger in 1956).

[UFO Information](https://preview.redd.it/e3tb2f0r7cs81.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6e4f37cb2a358d380701f67cf3a43c2c9af1db3)

We also recall that color photos exist of a manned flying disc that landed and immediately took off again, and which was marked with two crosses, a Balkenkreuz, and a swastika.

These photos were taken in the 1970s by a night watchman in West Germany. A very good dossier of photos and films exists on the flying machines mentioned above, for example, the 60-minute documentation "" UFO Secrets of the Third Reich""; (MGA Austria/Royal Atlantis Film GmbH). Likewise the dossier of the American Vladimir Terziski who, during the UFO conference in September 1991 in Phoenix Arizona showed slides for three hours and showed photos of German saucers, drawings of their construction, and subterranean German bases.

The Italian Air Force Commander Renato Vesco’s book is also very interesting, as is that of Rudolf Lusar:

>""Die deutschen Waffen und Geheimwaffen des 2. Weltkrieges und ihre Weiterentwicklung,"" J. F. Lehmanns Verlag, Munich, 1971\[see earlier English edition ""German Secret Weapons of the Second World War and their Further Development,"" Neville Spearman, London, 1959\].

Do you now understand why the mass media dismisses everything about UFOs as a fraud? Taking this German background into account, the world of the press and the media controlled by the Illuminati, by means of the Anglo-American-Zionist lobby is prepared to invest enormous sums to prevent citizens from investigating this area.

The question that arises now is: from where did the German secret societies Thule and Vril get the indispensable knowledge for the construction of these flying machines? From where did they get their understanding of genetic engineering, in which the Germans were likewise well ahead of other nations?

According to the statements of Herbert G. Dorsey and other researchers, they were helped not only by the telepathic contacts with extraterrestrials in providing construction drawings but also by studying the intact drive of a non-terrestrial saucer that crashed in the Black Forest in 1936. But there is practically no evidence of that event, nor any eyewitnesses still alive.

However, evidence exists in the USA, even a lot of it. Because at the same time the Americans recorded a series of objects which crashed to the ground, and which could not be kept completely secret.

We shall revisit these later. Returning to the politics, while I.G. Farben supported Hitler, its cartel partner Standard Oil Rockefeller aroused the people against the Nazis. Similarly, the Ford Motor Company made armaments for the American Army, but at the same time built military vehicles for the Nazis in Germany. Ford and Opel (a branch of General Motors which is controlled by J. P. Morgan) were the two largest tank manufacturers in Hitler’s Germany.

No matter who won the war, the multinationals were winners from the start.

Many enterprises operated on the same principle during World War 2. Why is there nothing about this in the schoolbooks or encyclopedias? One of the reasons is as follows: in 1946 the Rockefeller foundation distributed 139,000 USD to present an official version of World War 2 to the public, which concealed all aid given by American bankers for building the Nazi regime and was also silent about the mystical and occult ideology of that regime.

by **Philip Coppens**

**February 2008**

**from** [**PhilipCoppens**](http://www.philipcoppens.com/) **Website**

[**Spanish version**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_67.htm)  
 

Are the Indian remains of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa, their sudden abandonment and the apparent discovery of an ancient site with a layer of radioactive ash the best available evidence for the possibility that our ancient ancestors possessed a highly advanced technology - which might have included [atomic warfare](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ancient_atomic.htm)?

&#x200B;

Did an ancient advanced - if not extra-terrestrial - civilization exist on Earth?

The question is very intriguing and despite the academic ridicule that has been bestowed on the likes of **Erich von Däniken** and [**Zecharia Sitchin**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sitchin.htm), the idea has caught the world’s imagination, with the help of Hollywood and shows such as Stargate SG-1.

But apart from a battle for our hearts, there is also a battle for our minds: is there evidence that ET visited and lived here, millennia ago?

Many possible scenarios and theories have been put forward, from statements that Atlantis was a high tech civilization, leaving us an as yet undiscovered Hall of Records and the pyramid complex at Gizeh, to the possibility that the [Nazca lines](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lineas_nazca.htm) might be a prehistoric airport.  


In 2007, the latter was voted as one of the *Fortean Wonders of the World*. Nazca’s popularity is almost singularly due to Erich von Däniken, whose approach in his quest for serious consideration of the “ET question” has been to point out various anomalies, resulting in a pool of evidence that is then queried as to whether together, this could - should - be seen as evidence of either an alien or a highly technologically advanced civilization.

What his approach has revealed, is that science in the 1960s thought it had all the answers, but largely had to perform much additional research. Today, this has meant that some of the sites, such as Nazca, have received a more proper scientific study.

In a larger context, von Däniken’s “body of evidence” has also enabled easier acceptance of sites such as [Caral](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/caral.htm), which truly have made the “New World” as “Old” - if not older - revealing many parallels between the two continents. To some extent, von Däniken has fought “their battle”, eased the scientific acceptance of Caral and like.

It is therefore clear that von Däniken has had an impact on archaeology, but, equally, since first airing the question whether or not we have alien ancestors, the answer has remained a negative: there is, four decades later, no hard evidence ET landed on Earth.  


Another popular ancient astronaut author is Zecharia Sitchin, who, in origin, decided to focus on a more specific area, [the Sumerian civilization](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sumer_annunaki.htm), and analyzed every detail of its myths and history, claiming the devil was in the detail:

>that hidden inside these myths, when properly translated and explained, was clear evidence of an alien component of this civilization, which he then set out to write down in a series of books, *The Earth Chronicles*, beginning with [The Twelfth Planet](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sitchin/planeta12/12planeteng_index.htm) in 1976.

Like von Däniken, Sitchin’s work has been popular, but unlike von Däniken, Sitchin has definitely failed in making any impact on the scientific community - though he has made a major contribution to the “conspiracy theories” out there, who see some of the wars fought in the Middle East as having a “clear” alien component.

That Sitchin’s work had this result is remarkable, as his approach might seem to be more scientific - and perhaps better:

>he focused on the quest for the “best evidence”, a single piece of evidence that in itself is the best example to support a conclusion.

The term is used in court, and is the so-called “smoking gun”:

>in presenting your case for the jury, what single piece of evidence would convince that jury that a person is guilty of the allegation?

So, even though Sitchin has failed, in the search for an advanced ancient civilization, what would be this “best evidence” that could convince the jury ET dropped by, many millennia ago?

First, we need to assume that ET somehow will have left physical traces of his presence, and that this trace has withstood the test of time. A spaceship landing off the shores of some country, ET walking on the beach and speaking with the local inhabitants, will have left no physical trace, except, perhaps, an oral or written tradition of “some ancestor” conversing with “a being” on the shore “a long time ago”.

We should hope this being left some gift with the ancestors, and that they carefully preserved it, and that this gift can be shown to be of alien origin. But this is not a given.

The “best evidence” therefore needs to be long-lasting, and a clear sign of an advanced civilization; the so-called “oop-arts” (out of place artifacts) such as the [Antikythera machine](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ciencia_antikythera.htm), the [Phaistos Disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disk), etc., are all in themselves not evidence of an advanced extra-terrestrial civilization, but “merely” evidence that some of our ancestors, or entire civilizations, were far more clever than academics were willing to grant them.

Though von Däniken has made tremendous impact here, it is, as mentioned, not part of the real battle he wants to win.  


Within our current mindset, detailed changes to the [DNA molecular structure](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_genoma.htm) could be seen as evidence of a highly advanced manipulation, outside the scope of any of our earthly ancestors.

Indeed, Sitchin has looked towards such genetic manipulations and claims to have “read” such accounts in the Sumerian myths; others who have read the same accounts nevertheless remain unconvinced. However, at present, our understanding of the gene pool does not allow us to even begin to look where we could find evidence inside that gene pool whether ET intervened in it or not.  


One of the other “best candidates” for best evidence is the conquest of the [atom-nuclear warfare](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ancient_atomic.htm), which according to Sitchin is precisely what occurred in the Middle East in the third millennium BC. In support for this conclusion, he has consistently relied upon photographs of the Sinai Peninsula, taken from space. They purportedly show an immense cavity and crack in its surface, showing us where the nuclear explosion has taken place.

He adds that the area is strewn with crushed, burnt and blackened rocks, which contain a highly unusual ratio of isotope uranium-235,

>“indicating in expert opinions exposure to sudden immense heat of nuclear origin”, to quote Sitchin.

Alas, Sitchin provides no further detail who these experts are, or where they have expressed such opinions, thus weakening his own case for what would otherwise be very good evidence.

In recent publications, Sitchin has also argued that the “[Climate Change and the Collapse of the Akkadian Empire - Evidence from the Deep Sea](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/climatechange_collapseakkadianempire.pdf)” article, which was published in the April 2000 issue of “Geology”, is confirmation of his claim.

The essay argues that an unusual climate change occurred in the areas adjoining the Dead Sea, which gave rise to dust storms and that the dust - an unusual “atmospheric mineral dust” - was carried by the prevailing winds over the Persian Gulf.

According to Sitchin, this was due to an,

>“uncommon dramatic event that occurred near 4025 years before the present”, or ca. 2025 BC.

He adds that the Dead Sea level fell abruptly by 100 meters at the time, underlining that something truly catastrophic did happen.

Alas, consultation of the report itself reveals that Sitchin has been more than “selective” in his summary of this report. Though the reports states a catastrophe occurred, the report clearly reveals that the likely cause of this climate change was a volcanic eruption - not a nuclear explosion. Though the report is unable to identify which volcano was responsible for this sudden climate shift, the report clearly correlates the presence of volcanic ash with the ensuing disasters.

In short, it is not evidence of a nuclear explosion at all; it is evidence of a so far unidentified volcanic eruption. As there are references to “volcanic ash” in the abstract and summary of the report, the question should be asked why Sitchin failed to see this.

The problematic verification of Sitchin’s claim is not a new allegation and is a known problem for his theories. Furthermore, despite decades of searching, he seems to have been unable to find supporting evidence that the Sinai Peninsula is indeed strewn with nuclear debris.

This does not invalidate his theory as such, but has stopped him - and “[the ancient astronaut cause](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_AAtheory.htm)” in general - to advance. Indeed, his often-maligned unscientific methodology of writing has been seen by some as hurting, more than advancing, that cause.  


Another candidate for a nuclear explosion, so far left untouched by most of the “ancient astronaut proponents”, is the Indus River Valley, where towns such as Harappa and [Mohenjo Daro](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_mohenjo_daro.htm) flourished in 3000 BC, but were then quickly abandoned. One answer that has been put forward is that the ancient cities might have been irradiated by an atomic blast.

If true, it would be impossible to ignore the conclusion that ancient civilization possessed high technology.  
 

**The ruins of Harappa**  
What this candidate has in its favor is that a layer of radioactive ash was indeed found in Rajasthan, India.

It covered a three-square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur. The research occurred after a very high rate of birth defects and cancer was discovered in the area. The levels of radiation registered so high on investigators’ gauges that the Indian government cordoned off the region.

Scientists then apparently unearthed an ancient city where they found evidence of an atomic blast dating back thousands of years: from 8,000 to 12,000 years. The blast was said to have destroyed most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. So far, this story seems to have all the necessary credentials.  


Archaeologist Francis Taylor stated that etchings in some nearby temples he translated, suggested that they prayed to be spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city.

>“It’s so mind-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear technology before we did. The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare.”

Furthermore, when excavations of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro reached the street level, they discovered skeletons scattered about the cities, many holding hands and sprawling in the streets as if some instant, horrible doom had killed its inhabitants.

People were just lying, unburied, in the streets of the city; there seemed no-one available to bury them afterwards.

What could cause such a thing? Why did the bodies not decay or get eaten by wild animals?

Furthermore, there is no apparent cause of a physically violent death. Furthermore, **Alexander Gorbovsky**, in “Riddles of Ancient History” (1966, Soviet Publishers, Moscow), reported the discovery of at least one human skeleton in this area with a level of radioactivity approximately fifty times greater than it should have been due to natural radiation.

Furthermore, thousands of fused lumps, christened “black stones”, have been found at Mohenjo Daro. These appear to be fragments of clay vessels that melted together in extreme heat.  


Another curious sign of an ancient nuclear war in India is a giant crater near Mumbai (formerly Bombay).

The nearly circular 2,154-meter-diameter [Lonar crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonar_crater) (below image), located 400 kilometers northeast of Mumbai and dated at less than 50,000 years old, could be related to nuclear warfare of antiquity.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i7uzoewfcme51.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae519ee497d6098c83c93a4c2843afb24c613286

 

No trace of any meteoric material, etc., has been found at the site or in the vicinity, and this is the world’s only known “impact” crater in basalt.

Indications of great shock (from a pressure exceeding 600,000 atmospheres) and intense, abrupt heat (indicated by basalt glass spherules) can be ascertained from the site.  


With the apparent discovery of this radiated area, parallels were quickly drawn to the [Mahabharata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata), the Indian epic, which indeed speak of doom and destruction.

It reads:

>... (it was) a single projectile  
Charged with all the power of the Universe.  
An incandescent column of smoke and flame  
As bright as the thousand suns  
Rose in all its splendor...  
...it was an unknown weapon,  
An iron thunderbolt,  
A gigantic messenger of death,  
Which reduced to ashes  
The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.  
...The corpses were so burned  
As to be unrecognizable.  
The hair and nails fell out;  
Pottery broke without apparent cause,  
And the birds turned white.  
After a few hours  
All foodstuffs were infected...  
....to escape from this fire  
The soldiers threw themselves in streams  
To wash themselves and their equipment.

Whereas the story of the Mahabharata is indirect evidence, the archaeological discoveries in India pose serious problems for those trying to deny the possibility that this might indeed be evidence of [ancient atomic warfare](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ancient_atomic.htm).

Whereas believing in the existence of [Atlantis](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) or a highly advanced civilization that might not have left any trace is one thing, to suggest that our ancestors might have wiped themselves out along the same lines we were in fear of accomplishing during the latter half of the 20th century is a major paradigm shift.  


Is this the best evidence?

One skeptic stated:

>“I am sick and tired of hearing this \[the possibility of an atomic explosion in India\], and I cannot find any debunks of this either. Anyone who can debunk this, or is this really true?”

That is indeed the question… and an important one.

The stakes are high, as one would expect when facing the best evidence.  
 

**Lonar crater**  
So, let us examine what might be the best evidence.

The first question is whether the named archaeologist **Francis Taylor** existed. Alas, no-one has ever been able to identify him. There is a Francis Taylor, an American museum director, who died in 1957. He was, however, not an archaeologist. There is a “Francisco Taylor”, but he is not the above quoted Francis Taylor.

Hence, not a good start.

Skeptics have also wondered whether the ancient atomic warfare is not a modern invention, to deflect attention away from a serious - modern - atomic contamination. In 1998, it was reported that some Indian power stations had major problems. One had an incident in which 2000 workers became exposed to excess radiation, 300 of which had to be hospitalized.

**Surendra Gadekar** investigated the conditions of villagers at Rawatbhatta in Rajasthan and confirmed there were indeed gross radiation-related deformities. We note that Rawatbhatta is in the same region as the discovery of the “ancient warfare” site.

But Gadekar did not find evidence of ancient warfare, but did find evidence of modern negligence:

>wood that had been used in the power plant, had then “somehow” made its way into the local community, where it was subsequently used as wood for a fire.

This in itself was a minor incident, but could there have been more serious incidents, whereby a decision was made to create an “ancient enigma”?

Though a possibility, there is no evidence to back up this conclusion at present.

Regrettably, we also find that there are no newspapers that carried the story of the discovery. The Indian archaeological authorities are not aware of the story. And as there is a government laboratory in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the question is whether something might have gone wrong there.  


With the above objections, the case for the best evidence has become more controversial than a straightforward case. Still, it is clear that the counterarguments have not demolished the potential of this evidence.

Alas, in this case, neither side of the debate has truly embraced trying to prove or disprove the allegations. Indeed, it is remarkable that this has not happened, noting the potential that resides within it, as well as the multi-disciplinary approach that this cause allows.

Are the proponents of the case unwilling to stake their “reputation” on it? Perhaps. But even if they were to fail, Rome was not built in one day, and arguing for or against the case of an ancient highly advanced civilization will not take any less time.  
 

Until the subject is seriously tackled, the bodies of Harappa and [Mohenjo Daro](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_mohenjo_daro.htm) remain a mystery, whether or not the Indian radioactive site turns out to be modern or ancient, it is, at least, an uncontested fact that the site was radioactive. The anomalous crater adds power to the possibility and so does other circumstantial evidence.

Finally, the fact that all these enigmas are within one general region (as opposed to scattered across the world) adds even further weight to the case… but then this should be expected if we were to consider this case to be the best evidence.

The problem of the “best evidence” is often that it sounds too good to be true. That is either because it is, or because it is indeed the “best evidence”.

And only careful analysis of the evidence will reveal what is what.",conspiracy,climate change

Furthermore, the war in Ukraine will restrict the flow of agricultural exports and fertilizers from that part of the world for a long time, because the war has no end in sight. In essence, we are facing a “perfect storm” for global food production,

Global hunger has been on the rise for years, and the UN World Food Program is warning that we are heading towards “another year of record hunger”…

The world is at risk of another year of record famine as the global food crisis continues to drive even more people into ever-greater levels of severe hunger, warns the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in a call for action. Urgent action to address the root causes of today's food crisis ahead of World Food Day on 16 October.

The global food crisis is a confluence of competing crises – caused by climate shocks, conflict and economic pressures – that has raised the number of hungry people worldwide from 282 million to 345 million in the first few months of 2022 alone. The United Nations World has expanded food assistance targets to reach a record 153 million people by 2022, and by mid-year it had already provided assistance to 111.2 million people.

But, as I've been constantly warning, this is just the beginning. Eventually, there will be billions of people who won't have enough to eat regularly. In all my years, I've never seen hunger spread so quickly. In fact, there are a large number of people who are now facing starvation in the backyard of the United States…

&#x200B;

[Daily struggle against hunger leads many Venezuelans to live on leftover food](https://preview.redd.it/t9is5hirfkw91.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b31f97e152eac98731a709dc68cb923dbcced09e)

The United Nations is warning that hunger in one of Haiti's largest slums is at catastrophic levels as gang violence and economic crises push the country to ""a total breaking point"". Nearly 20,000 people in the impoverished Cité Soleil area of ​​the capital have dangerously little access to food and could face starvation, the UN says,

Across Haiti, nearly five million are struggling with malnutrition. “Haiti is facing a humanitarian catastrophe,” said a senior UN official.

But most people in the western world won't care until they starve themselves. Unfortunately, that day may be much closer than many people ever imagined. At the moment, two-thirds of all fertilizer production capacity in Europe has already been shut down because of the skyrocketing price of natural gas…

The fertilizer crisis in Europe is deepening with more than two-thirds of production capacity disrupted by rising gas costs, threatening farmers and consumers far beyond the region's borders.

Russia's tightening of gas shipments following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is hurting industries across Europe. But fertilizer companies are particularly hard hit because gas is an essential raw material and energy source for the industry.

There simply won't be enough fertilizer for European farmers in 2023. And there won't be enough for everyone else who depends on Europe's fertilizer production. That's a big deal, because without fertilizers, we would only be able to feed about half the planet.

Do you want to volunteer to be among those who don't get enough food? Meanwhile, the rising dollar is causing immense headaches for food importers around the world…

In Ghana, importers are warning of shortages in the run-up to Christmas. Thousands of containers loaded with food have been piled up recently in Pakistan's ports, as private bakers in Egypt have raised bread prices after some flour mills ran out of wheat because it was held up at customs.

Around the world, countries that rely on food imports are facing a destructive combination of high interest rates, an artificially high dollar and high commodity prices, eroding their power to pay for goods that are normally priced in dollars. The decrease in foreign currency reserves in many cases reduced access to dollars, and banks are slow to release payments.

The value of the US dollar has skyrocketed because the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates.

When the value of the dollar rises, poor countries have to pay much more for food in their own local currencies. So the Federal Reserve is actually making the global food crisis worse by raising its rates.

But they'll keep doing it anyway. At the same time, global weather patterns continue to go wrong. This summer, we witnessed the worst drought in Chinese history, Europe suffered the worst drought in 500 years, and the western US continued to suffer from the worst multi-year megadrought in at least 1,200 years.

It goes without saying that all this drought is absolutely devastating for agricultural production.

According to the Washington Post, “over 80% of the US is experiencing worrisome drought conditions” right now. In the middle of the country, this caused a terrible crisis for barge traffic along the Mississippi River…

The barge industry is quite important. It is crucial for moving aluminum, oil, fertilizer and coal, particularly in the Mississippi River and its tributaries. About 60% of grain and 54% of soybeans for US export are moved by barge. Barges also transport more than a third of exported coal.

Right now, the barge industry – and all of us who depend on its goods – is mired in a crisis. Water levels in the Mississippi River basin are at their lowest in more than a decade.

Last week, about 2,000 barges were hit at one point and stopped. Unfortunately, very dry conditions are expected “in the coming weeks” and therefore things are not expected to improve anytime soon…

Low water levels and dredging shut down barge traffic going north and south in Mississippi last week. At one point, over 100 tugs and 2,000 barges were stuck waiting. The blocked section of the river, between Louisiana and Mississippi, reopened on Monday. Traffic is limited to one direction, according to Petty Officer Jose Hernandez of the US Coast Guard.

That's certainly better than zero-hand traffic, but Mississippi is still expected to get even drier. Lisa Parker, a representative for the US Army Corps of Engineers, told FreightWaves that drier conditions are expected in the coming weeks. The river is consuming water reserves now, Parker added, but those reserves will eventually run out.

As a result of this crisis, barge movement rates for goods have skyrocketed and, ultimately, we could see massive amounts of agricultural produce rotting before reaching consumers…

As many barges are stuck and cannot move, barge prices are hyperinflating. At the time of writing, the highest price in USD per ton shown is $90.44. Before the massive peak, it was less than $10 to move a ton of goods.

The vast majority of bean bags and other agricultural products now stranded were destined for major export terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. While at least some of them appear to be covered and ventilated, how long do they actually last before spoiling?

On another note, we continue to see crabs die at a staggering rate. In fact, it is now being reported that winter snow crab fishing in Alaska has been suspended because the crab population has experienced a catastrophic decline…

Alaska authorities canceled several crab harvests in a conservation effort that sent shockwaves through the crab industry in the region.

Authorities have canceled the Bristol Bay autumn red king crab harvest and, for the first time on record, are also delaying the winter snow crab harvest, according to several reports.

The decision comes after the animals' recent population decline. Data from a NOAA survey of the East Bering Sea shows a 92% decline in the overall abundance of snow crabs from 2018 to 2021, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game confirmed to USA TODAY. An 83% decline occurred from 2018 to 2022, as some small crabs entered the population in 2022, according to the department's Division of Commercial Fisheries.

And thanks to the global avian flu pandemic, birds continue to die in staggering numbers as well.

If you can believe it, nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys have already been wiped out during this pandemic in the US and Europe alone, and experts warn that this pandemic will only intensify now that the cold weather is upon us.

Those of you who have been to the supermarket lately already know that the prices of eggs, chicken and turkey have soared to absolutely crazy levels. At this point, prices are so high that a recent poll found that one in four Americans plan to skip Thanksgiving this year to save money…

One in five Americans aren't sure they'll be able to cover the cost of Thanksgiving meals this year, and one in four plans to skip it to save money, according to a recent survey by Personal Capital.

The economic situation in America of senile puppet president \['Dementia' Joe\] Biden is affecting Americans' vacation plans. According to the survey, a quarter of Americans plan to skip Thanksgiving this year to save money, and one in five ""doubted they would have enough money to cover Thanksgiving costs this year.""

More specifically, a third expect the 2022 Thanksgiving dinner to be “smaller” and 45%, overall, said they are “finally stressed out” about Thanksgiving.

&#x200B;

Yes, things are already very bad. But according to senile puppet president \['Dementia' Joe\] Biden, it's all right. In fact, he says that “our economy is strong as hell”…

The comment came during a conversation with a Baskin Robbins reporter in Portland, Oregon, who asked the president if he had any concerns about the strength of the US dollar amid rising inflation.

With a chocolate ice cream cone in hand, Biden replied, “I'm not worried about the strength of the dollar. I'm worried about the rest of the world. Our economy is strong as hell.”

WEF agenda in full force: Hundreds of schools in the Netherlands have started a campaign introducing children aged 10 to 12 to mealworms and insects as a “sustainable” meat substitute. The objective is to provoke “changes in behavior through children without prejudice”

You believe him, don't you?

Our leaders want us to believe that all the problems we are facing right now are only temporary and that a new golden age of peace and prosperity is upon us. But if that's true, why are they so eager to make us eat bugs?

An enormous amount of time, energy and resources is being put behind a campaign to promote insects as one of the solutions to the growing global food crisis.

But I don't intend to eat bugs, and I'm sure you don't either. Sadly, there will not be enough food for everyone on the planet in 2023, and millions upon millions of deeply suffering individuals will soon be desperately hungry.

They can push to eat insects all they want, but that's not going to solve our problems. At the moment, they have absolutely no solution that will prevent large numbers of people from starving to death during the difficult years ahead of us.",conspiracy,climate change

1. Large bones in stone graves in Williamson County and White County, Tennessee. Discovered in the early 1800s, the average stature of these giants was 7 feet tall.  


2. Giant skeletons found in the mid-1800s in New York state near Rutland and Rodman.  


3. In 1833, soldiers digging at Lompock Rancho, California, discovered a male skeleton 12 feet tall. The skeleton was surrounded by caved shells, stone axes, other artifacts. The skeleton had double rows of upper and lower teeth. Unfortunately, this body was secretly buried because the local Indians became upset about the remains.  


4. A giant skull and vertebrae found in Wisconsin and Kansas City.  


5. A giant found off the California Coast on Santa Rosa Island in the 1800s was distinguished by its double rows of teeth.  


6. A 9-foot, 8-inch skeleton was excavated from a mount near Brewersville, Indiana, in 1879.  


7. Skeletons of ""enormous dimensions"" were found in mounds near Zanesville, Ohio, and Warren, Minnesota, in the 1880s.  


8. In Clearwater Minnesota, the skeletons of seven giants were found in mounds. These had receding foreheads and complete double dentition.  


9. At LeCrescent, Minnesota, mounds were found to contain giant bones. Five miles north near Dresbach, the bones of people over 8 feet tall were found.  


10. In 1888 seven skeletons ranging from seven to 8 feet tall were discovered.  


11. Near Toledo, Ohio, 20 skeletons were discovered with jaws and teeth ""twice as large as those of present day people."" The account also noted that odd hieroglyphics were found with the bodies.  


12. Miners in Lovelock Cave, California, discovered a very tall, red-haired mummy In 1911  


13. This mummy eventually went to a fraternal lodge where it was used for ""initiation purposes.""  


14. In 1931, skeletons from 8 1-2 to 10 feet long were found in the Humbolt lake bed in California.  


15. In 1932, Ellis Wright found human tracks in the gypsum rock at White Sands, New Mexico. His discovery was later backed up by Fred Arthur, Supervisor of the Lincoln National Park and others who reported that each footprint was 22 inches long and from 8 to 10 inches wide. They were certain the prints were human in origin due to the outline of the perfect prints coupled with a readily apparent instep.  


16. During World War II, author Ivan T. Sanderson tells of how his crew was bulldozing through sedimentary rock when it stumbled upon what appeared to be a graveyard. In it were crania that measured from 22 to 24 inches from base to crown nearly three times as large as an adult human skull. Had the creatures to whom these skulls belonged been properly proportioned, they undoubtedly would have been at least 12 feet tall or taller.  


17. In 1947 a local newspaper reported the discovery of nine-foot-tall skeletons by amateur archeologists working in Death Valley.  


18. The archeologists involved also claimed to have found what appeared to be the bones of tigers and dinosaurs with the human remains.  


19. The Catalina Islands, off California, are the home of dwarf mammoth bones that were once roasted in ancient fire pits. These were roasted and eaten by human-like creatures who were giants with double rows of teeth.  


20. One of the latest accounts of a race of giants that occupied Europe comes from the middle ages and involves a surprising figure: Saint Christopher. While modern stories of St. Christopher simply make him out as an ordinary man, or perhaps a somewhat homely man, those who actually saw him had a different story. According to his peers, he was a giant, belonging to a tribe of dog-headed, cannibalistic giants. Jacques de Voragine in The Golden Legend wrote of St. Christopher:""He was of gigantic stature, had a terrifying mien, was twelve coudees tall.”  


21. A coudee is an antique measurement equal to or larger than the English linear measurement of a foot. According to this ancient account, St. Christopher stood from 12 to 18 feet tall (a fact that has become hidden in or even erased from church history).  


22. While Western icons don't picture St. Christopher as contemporary accounts described him, those of the Eastern churches do. Often the suggestion is seen in historic accounts that St. Christopher was the product of a tryst between a human being and an Anubis (a demon-like creature based on the Greek Anoubis, which came from the Egyptians jackal-headed god who was believed to lead the dead to judgment)

1. In other words, according to the contemporary accounts of his day, St. Christopher was the product of a spiritual being who mated with a human woman. And once again the result of this union was a creature that matches the descriptions of **the Nephilim**.  
**GENESIS 6:4**  


There were GIANTS in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the SONS OF GOD (Fallen Angels) came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

>1.One of the many races of giants.  


&#x200B;

**...AND THEY BUILT STONEHENGE**  
There is ample reasons to believe that the monoliths in Salisbury, England, were not built by either the Druids or normal human beings. When one consider the megaliths proportions, tonnage, and lack of resources in terms of both nature and human; and the lack of technology, the possibility that I am suggesting is not so far-fetched as it may seem.  
1. Not a lot is known about the people who would become known as the Celts. It is known that they migrated across Asia Minor, through northern Europe and into what have become the Celtic countries of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Most accounts of them include references to the giants that were often found among them. The ancient Greek historian Pausanias called them ""the world's tallest people.""  


2. ""Modern historians now believe that, in fact, the giants among the Celts were a ruling class that held control over the indigenous population that formed the majority of the Celtic tribes.  


3. As these 60-some tribes that comprised the Cimbri or Cimmerian peoples traveled across Europe, migrating and taking over areas and later being driven Eastward by other cultures, the name of the people changed. While they were in Asia Minor, they were known as the Gomarian Sacae; this was shortened and modified to become Celtae (meaning ""potent and valiant men"" similar to the ""mighty men"" on the Genesis 6 passage). The Greeks called them Galatai a corruption of Celtae; the Romans further changed this name to become Gauls.  


4. Although the Romans 'would eventually devise methods of defeating these giant warriors, attacking long legs that couldn't be guarded by the massive shields these creatures carried, the blue-eyed, blond giants inspired terror among those facing them in battle for the first time.  


The travels of the giants through the German region also most likely inspired the Teutonic legends of the Aryan race of superhumans (with the early name of ""Cimmerian"" having an obvious resemblance that is probably more than happenstance to Aryan). The Nazi ideal ""superman"" was a blue-eyed, blond giant; this is the exact historic description of the Celtae. DeLoach has also made a good argument that the giants ruling the Celtae may very well have been descendants of the Anakim, the giants the Israelites found in the Promised Land. His argument is based on the Roman poet Virgil's account of the Gauls which describes them:  


“Golden is their hair and golden their garb. They are resplendent in their striped cloaks,and their milk-white necks are circled with gold.”  


5.These distinctive gold necklaces have also been discovered in numerous archeological finds, bolstering Virgil's observations.  


6. This tight gold band around the necks of theCeltae is what ties them to the biblical accounts of the Nephilim. Remembering that the Anakim were one of the tribes that were listed as being giants in the Bible, the clue that links the Celtae to the Nephilim is the Hebrew word which is translated as ""Anakim"" in English: The actual word is Anaqiy, meaning ""a descendent of Anak.""  


7. Now the word translated as ""Anak"" in the English version of the Bible is Anaq and was employed as another term for""Canaanite.""  


8. As noted earlier, this suggests that the culture that ruled much of the Promised Land when the Israelites invaded it was comprised of two classes with the Anakim acting as a ruling elite within a larger human population.  


But there's more. Hebrew names are often based on common words, giving the names special meanings that relate it back to characteristics of the individual or thing being named. The word, Anaq, which was employed to name the Anak, used in other contexts means ""a necklace so tight as to appear to be strangling."" Use of this word suggests that the most noticeable feature of the descendants of Anak was a tight chain about the neck.  


That same feature was the distinguishing characteristic that Virgil chose to remark on when describing the Gauls.  


This leads to an important possibility. The Anakim, or giants that adopted their practices, were pushed out of Canaan by the Israelites, going northward and eventually traveling westward over Europe and, with the passage of several millennia, finally settled in the Celtic nations.

**Their Religious Practices**  


9. If the Anakim and the giants among the Celtae were one and the same people, then it's possible to gain an insight into the religious practices of the Nephilim. While the Bible doesn't reveal much about the religious practices of the Anakim, it does hint at human and infant sacrifices and similar horrors. God ordered the Israelites to kill all the men,women and children in many of the cities taken during the invasion of the land by the Jews.  


10.However, more Is known historically from non-Biblical sources about the religion that the Celtae practiced. Ancient historians had a variety of horrors to tell about the Celtae giants, including the fact that they were homosexuals (another crime which dictated the death penalty under Mosaic law). Athenaeus states that the giants were accustomed to sleeping with not one but two boys. The historian Diodorus also suggested that homosexuality was rampant among the giants when he wrote:  


*“Although their wives are comely, they have very little to do with them, but rage with lust in outlandish fashion for the embraces of males. And the most astonishing thing of all is that they feel no concern for their proper dignity but prostitute to others without a qualm the flower of their bodies; nor do they consider this a disgraceful thing to do, but rather when anyone of them is thus approached and refuses the favor offered him, this they consider an act of dishonor.”*  


These passages also provide important links that help prove the Celtae are Nephilim.   


11. Not surprisingly, the religion that the Celtae practiced was also savage and brutal. This religion has come to be known best for the blood-thirsty priests who led its unspeakable acts, the ""Druids."" The actual practices of this religion have mercifully been lost to our modern age. This came about through the number of conquests of the areas ruled by the Celtae giants by the Romans and later the Norsemen, Normans and Saxons. The spread of Christianity through the region spelled the final death blow for the bloody practices of the Druids, leaving behind only altars designed for human sacrifices and the placement of ""magic"" stone monuments that have recently been discovered to have been carefully aligned with the stars, planets, sun and moon. The Druid religion is currently being revived by New Age and neo-pagan groups worldwide another horrifying fact that suggests another assault against the human race might be in place even as we speak.  


Because Ireland was never successfully invaded by the Romans, it remained the last holdout of the human beings who practiced the religion of the Druids after the last of the Celtae giants had apparently died off. St. Patrick and St. Columcille are generally credited with bringing an end to the pagan practices. (St. Patrick was also credited with driving the snakes from Ireland; one might speculate that these ""snakes"" might have been serpents similar to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. If so, these might have been some sort of fallen angels in the form of reptiles.) There are a few horrific details that have filtered down to us about the Druids' practices, however. One is that these priests not only placed their blessings on human sacrifice, they often performed the rites themselves.  


Julius Caesar wrote:

>*“The Gauls believe the power of the immortal gods can be appeased only if one human life is exchanged for another and they have sacrifices of this kind regularly established by the community. Some of them have enormous images made of wickerwork, the limbs of which they fill with living men; these are set on fire and the men perish, enveloped in the flames. They believe that the gods prefer it if the executed have been caught in the act of theft or armed robbery or some other crime. But when the supply of such victims runs out, they even go to the extent of sacrificing innocent men.”*

12. Diodorus had an even more horrifying story about how the Celtae giants attempted to read the future:

>“They devote to death a human being and plunge a dagger into him in the region above the diaphragm, and when the stricken victim has fallen, they read the future from the manner of his fall and from the twitching of his limbs, as well as from the gushing of the blood, having learned to place confidence in an ancient and long-continued practice of observing such matters.""

The exact religious practices of the Anakim are unknown But suffice it to say that the little that has filtered down to us reflects the extreme wickedness and savagery of the Old Testament accounts of these creatures. That groups around the world are now in the process of reviving the Druid and Egyptian practices also speaks volumes about where many in our own times are headed, and what they are really trying to accomplish by reviving this depraved religion.... things are just not always what they appear to be.

\[Revelation 9:1\] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.  


\[Revelation 9:2\] And he opened the bottomless pit; ...”  


1. The assertions starts with the burden of proof listed in, “GIANTS I”, based on the following statement, and further proved beyond doubt that there were indeed a number of civilizations that were giants:  
 

**GENESIS 6:2**

That the SONS OF GOD saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose....  
 

**GENESIS 6:4**

There were GIANTS in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the SONS OF GOD (Fallen Angels) came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.  


The standard contention is: is this biblical myth, or is this a historical reality of the past... and today?  


The new challenging assertion set before you is this: where are they now, if they ever really did exist? The answer?....“the inner earth”. And the entrances to this new homeland: one at the extreme northern axis of the earth, the other at the extreme southern axis.  


Throughout history and various cultures, this new homeland has taken on various appellations:

>The Ultimate Thule  
Aggartha  
Shamballa  
Shangri-La  
Elusian Fields  
Asgard  
Atlantis  
Valhalla  
Realm of Jason & the Argonauts, etc.

As fantastic as the assertion sounds, the burden of proof resides in this brief documentation. But to save space, and not to try your patience, I have only chosen select passages from each publications included therein. Nevertheless, let us start from the most ancient documentation, progressing to the more contemporary -  


Your intellectual foundations are about to be challenged... For truth is sometimes much stranger than fiction  
 

**From the “SECRETS OF ENOCH”**  
2. “The men (literally, angels) took me on to the fifth heaven and placed me, and there I saw many and countless soldiers, called Grigori (rebellious angels), of human appearance, and their size was greater than that of great giants...”  


3. “And I said to the Grigori: ‘I saw your brethren and their works, and their great torments, and I prayed for them, but the Lord has condemned them to be under earth till heaven and earth shall end forever’. ....”  


4. THE BOOK OF ENOCH (**The Watchers**)  


5. “Then they (the angels) took wives, each choosing for himself, whom they began to approach, and with whom they cohabited; teaching them sorcery,  
incantations, and the divining of roots and trees. And the women conceiving brought forth giants, whom stature was each three hundreth cubits. ....  


6. ”To Michael likewise the Lord said,... bind them for seventy generations underneaththe earth,...”  


7. “From there I went on towards the extremities of the earth; where I saw large beasts different from each other, and birds various in countenances and forms,  
as well as with notes of different sounds. ... ”  


8. “From there I advanced on towards the north, to the extremities of the earth. And there I saw a great and glorious wonder at the extremities of the whole earth.I saw there heavenly gates opening into heavens; three of them distinctly separated. The northern winds proceeded from them, blowing cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain....”

**THE BOOK OF JUBILEES**  
9. “...that the angels of God saw them (earthly women) on a certain year of this jubilee, that they were beautiful to look upon;  
and they took themselves wives of all whom they chose, and they bare to them sons and they were giants. ...”  


10.“And against the angels whom He (God) had sent upon earth, He was exceedingly wroth, and He gave commandment to root them out of all their dominion,  
and He bade us to bind them in the depths of the earth, and behold they bound in the midst of them...”

**ADMIRAL RICHARD B. BYRD'S DIARY (FEB - MAR.1947)**  


**(“The Inner Earth : My Secret Diary”)**  
**THE LAND BEYOND THE POLES - THE EXPLORATION FLIGHT OVER THE NORTH POLE.**  


I must write this diary in secrecy and obscurity. It concerns my Arctic flight of the nineteenth day of February in the year of Nineteen and Forty Seven.  


There comes a time when the rationality of men must fade into insignificance and one must accept the inevitability of the Truth! am not at liberty to disclose the following documentation at this writing... perhaps it shall never see the light of public scrutiny, but I must do my duty and record here for all to read one day. In a world of greed and exploitation of certain of mankind, one can no longer suppress that which is truth.  


**1. FLIGHT LOG: BASE CAMP ARCTIC, 2119/1947**  
0600 HOURS - All preparations are complete for our flight north ward and we are airborne with full fuel tanks at 0610 Hours.....  


0910 HOURS - Vast Ice and snow below, note coloration of yellowish nature, and dispersed in a linear pattern. Altering course for a better examination of this color pattern below, note reddish or purple color also. Circle this area two full turns and return to assigned compass heading. Position check made again to base camp, and relay information concerning colorations in the Ice and snow below.  


0910 HOURS - Both Magnetic and Gyro compasses beginning to gyrate and wobble, we are unable to hold our heading by instrumentation. Take bearing with Sun compass, yet all seems well. The controls are seemingly slow to respond and have sluggish quality, but there is no indication of Icing!  


0915 HOURS - In the distance is what appears to be mountains.  


0949 HOURS -29 minutes elapsed flight time from the first sighting of the mountains, it is no illusion. They are mountains and consisting of a small range that I have never seen before!  


0955 HOURS - Altitude change to 2950 feet, encountering strong turbulence again.  


**2. 1000 HOURS**

We are crossing over the small mountain range and still proceeding northward as best as can be ascertained. Beyond the mountain range is what appears to be a valley with a small river or stream running through the center portion. There should be no green valley below! Something is definitely wrong and abnormal here! We should be over Ice and Snow! To the portside are great forests growing on the mountain slopes. ...

2.To this point, Ch.7, pg. 81.

1140 HOURS - Another radio message received. We begin the landing process now, and in moments the plane shudders slightly, and begins a descent as though caught in some great unseen elevator! The downward motion is negligible, and we touch down with only a slight jolt!  


1.1145 HOURS - I am making a hasty last entry in the flight log. Several men are approaching on foot toward our aircraft. They are tall with blond hair.  


2.In the distance is a large shimmering city pulsating with rainbow hues of color. I do not know what is going to happen now, but I see no signs of weapons on those approaching. I hear now a voice ordering me by name to open the cargo door. I comply.  


END LOG  


**3. MARCH 11, 1947**  
I have just attended a staff meeting at the Pentagon. I have stated fully my discovery and the message from the Master. All is duly recorded. The President has been advised. I am now detained for several hours (six hours, thirty-nine minutes, to be exact.) I am interviewed intently by Top Security Forces and a medical team. It was an ordeal! I am placed under strict control via the national security provisions of this United States of America. I am ORDERED TO REMAIN SILENT IN REGARD TO ALL THAT I HAVE LEARNED, ON THE BEHALF OF HUMANITY! Incredible! I am reminded that I am a military man I must obey orders....  


In further confirmation of Admiral Byrd's discovery are reports of individuals who claimed they had entered the north polar opening, as many Arctic explorers did without knowing they did, and penetrated far enough into it to reach the Subterranean World in the hollow interior of the Earth. Dr. Nephi Cottom of Los Angeles reported that one of his patients, a man of Nordic descent, told him the following story:  


""I lived near the Arctic Circle in Norway. One summer my friend and I made up our minds to take a boat trip together, and go as far as we could into the north country. So we put one month's food provisions in a small fishing boat, and with sail and also a good engine in our boat, we set to sea.  


4. At the end of one month we had travelled far into the north, beyond the Pole and into a strange new country. We were much astonished at the weather there. Warm, and at times at night it was almost too warm to sleep. Then we saw something so strange that we both were astonished. Ahead of the warm open sea we were on what looked like a great mountain. Into that mountain at a certain point the ocean seemed to be emptying. Mystified, we continued in that direction and found ourselves sailing into a vast canyon leading into the interior of the earth. We kept sailing and then we saw what surprised us - a sun shining inside the earth!”  


5. Several of the inner earth inhabitants - huge giants - detected our boat on the river, and were quite amazed...

1. The presence of the open sea in the Northland is also explained. Olaf Jansen claims that the northern aperture, intake or hole, so to speak, is about fourteen hundred miles across. In connection with this, let us read what Explorer Jansen 'writes, on page 288 of his book: *“I have never had such a splendid sail. On to the north steadily north, with a good wind, as fast as stream and sail can take us, an open sea mile after mile, watch after watch, through these unknown regions, always clearer and clearer of ice, one might almost say: 'How long will it last?' The eye always turns to the northward as one paces the bridge. It is gazing into the future. But them is always the same dark sky ahead which means open sea.”* Again, the Norwood Review of England, in its issue of May 10, 1884, says: *“We do not admit that there is ice up to the Pole - once inside the great ice barrier, a new world breaks upon the Explorer, the climate is mild like that of England, and, afterward, balmy as the Greek Isles.”.....*  


2. My name is Olaf Jansen. I am a Norwegian, although I was born in the little seafaring Russian town of Uleaborg, on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, the northern arm of the Baltic Sea.  


I was in my nineteenth year when we started on what proved to be our last trip as fishermen, and which resulted in the strange story that shall be given to the world, - but not until I have finished my earthly pilgrimage...  


There was a tradition my father explained, that still farther northward was a land more beautiful than any that mortal man had ever known, and that it was inhabited by the Chosen.  


3. My youthful imagination was fired by the ardor, zeal and religious fervor of my good father, and I exclaimed: 'why not sail to this goodly land? The sky is fair, the wind favorable and the sea open.""....  


The compass, which we had fastened back in its place, in fear of another storm, was still pointing due north, and moving on its pivot just as it had in Stockholm. The dipping of the needle had ceased. What could this mean? Then, too, our many days of sailing had certainly carried us far past the North Pole. And yet the needle continued to point north. We were sorely perplexed, for surely our direction was now south.....  


4. Along the banks great forests miles in extent could be seen stretching away on the shoreline. The trees were of enormous size. We landed after anchoring near a sandy beach, and waded ashore, and were rewarded by finding a quantity of nuts that were very palatable and satisfying to hunger, and a welcome change from the monotony of our stock of provisions....

It was about the first of September, over five months we calculated, since our leave taking from Stockholm Suddenly we were frightened almost out of our wits by hearing in the far distance the singing of people. Very soon thereafter we discovered a huge ship gliding down the river directly toward us. Those aboard were singing in one mighty chorus that, echoing from bank to bank, sounded like a thousand voices, filling the whole universe with quivering melody. The accompaniment was played on stringed instruments not unlike our harps.  


It was a larger ship than any we had ever seen, and was differently constructed....  


The immense craft paused, and almost immediately a boat was lowered and six men of gigantic stature rowed to our little fishing-sloop. They spoke to us in a strange language. We knew from their manner, however, that they were not unfriendly. They talked a great deal among themselves, and one of them laughed immoderately, as though in finding us a queer discovery had been made. One of them spied our compass, and it seemed to interest them more than any other part of our sloop.....  


1. ""They seem to be kindly disposed,"" I replied, ""although what terrible giants! They must be the select six of the kingdom's crack regiment. Just look at their great size....""  


2. The surprise of my father and myself was indescribable when, amid the regal magnificence of a spacious hall, we were finally brought before the Great High Priest, ruler over all the land. He was richly robed, and much taller than those about him, and could not have been less than fourteen or fifteen feet in height. The immense room in which we were received seemed finished in solid slabs of gold thickly studded with jewels of amazing brilliancy....  


3. I remember hearing my father remark that the giant race of people in the land of 'The Smoky God had almost as accurate an idea of the geography of the ""outside"" surface of the earth as had the average college professor in Stockholm.......  


*“That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;”* Phillipian 2:10  


*“And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.”* Revelations 5:3  


“Seven rivers I beheld upon earth, greater than all rivers, one of which takes its course from the west; it to a great sea its water flows. Two comes from the north to the sea, there waters flowing into the Erythraean sea, on the east. And with respect to the remaining four, they take their course in the cavity of the north” Book Of Enoch 76:6-7

**PROLOGUE:**  


IN THE FIRST PLACE PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THAT I do not expect you to believe this story. Nor could you wonder had you witnessed a recent experience of mine when, in the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance, I gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London....  


1.The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed before I was half through! It is all that saved him from exploding--and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship, gold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into the thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere....  


As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre and unnatural - THERE WAS NO HORIZON! As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom -distance was lost in the distance. That was all - here was no clear-cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision"". A great light is commencing to break on me,"" continued Perry, taking out his watch. ""I believe that I have partially solved the riddle It is now two o'clock. When we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us. Where is it now?""  


2. I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven. And such a sun! I had scarcely noticed it before. Fully thrice the size of the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it.....  


When we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the great plain we saw a caravan of men and women - human beings like ourselves-and for the first time hope and relief filled my heart, until I could have cried out in the exuberance of my happiness. It is true that they were a half-naked, wild-appearing aggregation; but they at least were fashioned along the same lines as ourselves - there was nothing grotesque or horrible about them as about the other creatures in this strange, weird world.  


3. But as we came closer, our hearts sank once more, for we discovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck in a long line,... With little ceremony Perry and I were chained at the end of the line, and without further ado the interrupted march was resumed....  


4. On we stumbled beneath that hateful noonday sun. If we fell we were prodded with a sharp point. Our companions in chains did not stumble. They strode along proudly erect. Occasionally they would exchange words with one another in a monosyllabic language. They were a noble-appearing race with well-formed heads and perfect physiques. The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women, smaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads. The features of both sexes were well proportioned..........

**MY EPILOGUE:**  
There are some additional notes I wish to point out before closing. According to the ancient manuscripts, **the Watchers** not only provoked God by going into earthly women but, they also provoked Him by going into different animals - bestiality. And they taught man these depraved acts as well. And the results of their offspring, as you would probably surmise: terrible giants, unheard of abominations, horrible to look upon. Even the ancient historian Herodotus (circa 500 BC) made minute quotes of some of these atrocities (sic) of nature. But let us quote from another ancient manuscripts that was mentioned by the chroniclers of Joshua 10:13, and 2 Samuel 1:18 :

**From THE BOOK OF JASHER**  
1.“And their judges and rulers (which were the giants at this time) went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice, and son of men of those days took from the cattle of the earth, the beasts of field, and fowls of the air, and taught the mixture of animals of one species with the other, in order therewith to provoke the Lord; and God saw that the whole earth and it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth, all men and all animals.”

**From THE BOOK OF JUBILEES**  


2.“And lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way, alike men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth - all of them  
corrupted their ways and their orders, and they began to devour each other,...”  


3. ...and the earth was filled with inquity (sic). And after this they sinned against the beasts and the birds, and all that moves and walks on the earth...”  


I think it may be high time that we all had a little private conference with our teachers of Archaeology, Paleontology, Anthropology, Geology, and as well as Geography and Cartography.  


“And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” Job 1:7

The evidence is hidden in plain sight, and the warnings are delivered slowly. You had better start paying attention and drop the bread and circus. They don't want a mass panic. They don't want rioting. We're frogs dropped into cold water who don't notice the water getting hotter and killing us.    

I can't tell you whether or not the virus is still spreading or we're already all infected. I tend to think this is either a purposely released study to cover for the microbes outgassing of hydrogen sulfide, or the scientific community behind this aren't putting two and two together. Personally, I think it's deliberate to deceive. 

>Hundreds of scientists say there is evidence that the novel coronavirus in smaller particles in the air can infect people and are calling for the World Health Organization to revise its recommendations, the New York Times reported on Saturday.
The WHO has said the coronavirus spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks.
In an open letter to the United Nations agency, which the researchers plan to publish in a scientific journal next week, 239 scientists in 32 countries outlined the evidence showing smaller particles can infect people, [the NYT said.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/scientists-who-coronavirus-airborne-1.5638444)     

Now it's airborne. That's strange, isn’t it. Now a bigger cover for the outgassing exists to aid the virus and it's job of providing an explanation for the planet turning hostile. Again, the virus is real, it's making the emissions effects on your health worse.    

Let's keep looking shall we? Thanks to /U/UFOS-ARE-DEMONIC for the link. I appreciate it. 


>More recently, in 2018, the US EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially [dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/millions-of-abandoned-oil-wells-are-leaking-methane-a-climate-menace/76405267)    

####Potentially Dangerous.   

Ohhhh. So it might be dangerous. Phew. I was worried for a second there. Thank God it's just the abrupt climate change we have to worry about in this **New Normal that We're All In this Together**. Because if it was killing us I would freak out.     


>The US figures are sobering: More than 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells together emitted 281 kilotons of methane in 2018, according to the data, which was included in the US Environmental Protection Agency's most recent report on April 14 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That's the climate-damage equivalent of burning 16.2 million barrels of crude oil, according to an EPA calculation. That's more than the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, uses in two days.
The actual amount could be as much as three times higher, the EPA says, because of incomplete data. The agency believes most of the methane comes from the more than 2 million abandoned wells it estimates were never properly plugged.    

Could be much higher. Let me fix that for you. **The actual amount is estimated to as much as three times higher**. Words matter folks, keep your BS senses on high alert from now on.  

>In April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.   

Lake Erie. Go have a look at the coronavirus outbreaks there. Then read back in these posts. Then look into how much fresh water they're allowing to come into the great lakes and the waterfront properties being damaged. Expensive properties. Land owners are screaming. That's not normal, is it? But it's **New Normal**. They suddenly don't care about money, do they? Nope. Not in this New Normal of trying to secure natural resources. 


>""It's not like they leak for one year, and then they stop,"" said Kang, now a professor of civil engineering at McGill University in Montreal. ""Some of these have been there maybe for 100 years. And they are going to be there for another 100 years.""     


Perfect. It's like the gift that keeps on giving. At least it doesn't last forever like a diamond, just one hundred years.  

Let me provide you with an analogy here that you need to hear. Picture the planet like a big slap of brisket. Eventually it's going to dry age and rot, so you have to keep shaving off the rotten peices to keep the meat free of bacteria. The planet naturally does this through minor and major extinction events, before the planet cools like being put into a walk in cooler. So this happens no matter what. But we've made it either worse, faster, or both. Because we've turned the planet into ground beef. See, the reason you can eat steak raw is because the bacteria live on the outside and they aren't as numerous, and generally searing the steak for a couple of minutes kills the bacteria. But when you take beef and grind it, you mix the bacteria on the outside all through the meat, then it grows faster and there's more.   

Just like we've done with all the oil wells. We've mixed the earth. We've mined the earth and disrupted the magnetic field. Which is controlled by the core and magma, which releases more sulfur (earths core has most of the world's sulfur) for the microbes to eat and produce more hydrogen sulfide. We've dug more wells which released more microbes and increased emissions.   

On top of the entire natural cycle that is already taking place.    

It's going to get worse folks and they are doing everything they can to hide it. 

Do you remember how insistent they have been on a second wave? As in, one hundred percent it's going to happen? Well thanks to /u/WhiteRabbitCaveCA we know why. A study out of the WHO tells us that H2S gases stay in the ambient air for one day, but in the winter may persist for up to 42 days.    

Why that's just great news, isn’t it! It reminds me of Level 42 in Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when the Supercomputer is asked what's the meaning of life, and it spits out 42. That's it. Nothing more. Just 42. Oh. And the earth explodes at some point.   

Technocrats built Doomsday bunkers. We have a seed vault. We have GMO food to make crops more resilient. We have a massive emphasis on AI and it's ability to collect and interpret data. Do you know how much data is involved with this? What better way to interpret that data and it's effects on biological life than to analyze where a virus that activates by environmental factors has an outbreak?    

This is why I still have doubts as to where the virus came from. I may be wrong, but at least take that nugget of information into consideration.    

Nothing is what it seems. Don't trust anyone. Could the virus not be as harmful as it seems? Yes. Perhaps it is primarily a data marker that only affects the elderly or already weakened immune systems, you know, the individuals you know wouldn't make it through catastrophic events or be helpful in a war. And could the virus also have the secondary purpose of clearing out the hospitals in anticipation of future events?  

The virus isn’t bad in my area. Never has been. But I live in a small community and grew up with some nurses. But it's real. They have had cases. And it's bad when they do. And don’t listen when they claim that every death is listed as Covid-19. That's BS.     

CDC estimates* that, from October 1, 2019, through April 4, 2020, there have been:     .

####39,000,000 – 56,000,000 flu illnesses.     

####18,000,000 – 26,000,000 flu medical visits.      

####410,000 – 740,000 flu hospitalizations.      

####24,000 – 62,000 flu deaths.      

I might be wrong about everything that I'm typing, and I hope I am. But I'm not lying. I have a successful business and a good life, I would rather not have that change. Are the other's lying? I'm sure some are, and some are doing it deliberately and others aren't, they're just victims of a disinformation campaign to increase confusion.   

There is evidence out there that Covid-19 is an immune system virus. It's not conclusive, but it's there. Ask yourself why so many deaths are associated with co-factors. Then ask why outbreaks seem to be strongest on the  coasts, around areas of hypoxic waters, and areas of pollution? There are patterns here and hard questions that we have to ask. Compare mortality rates. There are definitely spikes in percentage in previously suggested areas. And then you have areas that have abnormal mortality rates compared to their outbreaks.    

There is too much too cover and a need to do so as soon as possible. Because as far as I have been able to thus far find, one other person on the planet has discovered the growing H2S threat. One. Other. Person. Do you find that hard to believe with the amount of scientists on the planet? I do. And there's only one other person who has put the big picture of the magnetic field,  sun, earths core, and climate, into one place. I find that hard to believe as well.  

I found both of these sites accidentally while researching after months of search results. Convenient, isn't it. You would have thought the results would have been much higher and not buried down in the netherlands of the net.  

Yeah right.   

They don't want us to find it.   

I will be getting to more posts on the political maneuvering, the propaganda and disinformation, how to possibly get your microbiome and therefore your immune system back to normal, and the upcoming food shortages. Oh, right, and some possible Reddit posts that are clustered, have high vote counts, and are all on the same topics. You know, like plauge and famine. All across the subs. All within a month that correspond to certain political events, but would have been impossible to notice until after the fact.

With that premise in mind. I don't care if you are a Trump supporter or a Biden supporter, Man, Woman, Black, White, Asian, Muslim, Christian, Jew, etc.

**WE ARE ALL HUMANS.** Stop seeing your neighbour as your enemy for literally having a different opinion than yours. Contrast is not a sin, conflict helps us evolve. What it is ALWAYS unjustified is the use of any kind of violence to force your ideas into others.

I am not your enemy, dear reader. I care about you and your freedom, no matter who you are or what you believe in. Unfortunately this world is not all rainbows and butterflies and there is a group that is coming for us. Yes, you and me. No matter who we are, we WILL be no exceptions. Some people are now out of the system, but if this keeps going on, for how long?

**I know for certain that each one of you, even if you don't admit it publicly, deep inside feel that something is very fucked up with this world. And for a good reason.**

Each one of you know that there is very little genuine kindness left in this world nowadays. Even if you behave kindly, you get punished for it. And it appears to infect every aspect of our so called ""modern"" society, while psycophathic and narcisist behaviours get encouraged and promoted in order to achieve your goals.

Just take a look around, very little kindness unless there is benefit in being kind (There is still kindness, though and a lot of people wanting to be kind silently). Division and de-humanization everywhere, so the psychopathic behaviors and actions get instantly justified just because that person is a Man, Woman, Trump Supporter, Biden Supporter, Black, White, Asian, Muslim, etc. and I am not.

Just look at your own life. You spend more or less 8 hours sleeping everyday (and you should), you work another 8 hours depending on where you live. You spend another 4 hours more or less just doing basic life manteinance like going to work and back home. A day has 24 hours, so you get 4 hours every working day to try and enjoy life. Excluding festivities. And all that in return for a house that you will pretty much never end to pay, healthcare that you will never be able to afford, poor quality food, etc. (In case that you don't know shit about finances and spend your money nonstop in the latest Iphone so you are not economically solvent).

Just take a look, our grandparents payed 20k for a house while we pay 120k for a much reduced space, while their wages could buy much more than we can buy today. I don't think anyone here woke up one day and said ""it is a good idea to freeze wages and make goods more expensive each year"".

Who benefits from it? Certainly not you, because you live in an almost permanent state of anger, fear, streess and remorse. But there is undoubtly someone that benefits from this system, or there wouldn't be one in the first place. That is how they get you. Terrorism, Climate Change, Radicalism, Viruses, Economic crashes, Political theatre, etc just to get inside your mind and prevent you from thinking by keeping you fearful, scared, angry, outraged, depressed. Just so you don't have time or motivation to think for yourself or to gather with others and come up with logical explanations. Why do you think MSM rarely reports good news?

**They know that the mind can escape this prison they created, and that it is the last frontier of freedom.**

The thing is that the more busy and occupied you are trying to live as best as you can and blaming everything bad on your neighbour, the less attention you pay to thinking objectively on why things are the way they are. On why the goverment takes 50% of your wage in taxes just to give it to other countries for example or to spend it in mansions or giving it to their corporate friends, and then proceeds to tax you yet again for food, owning things and basic shit like electricity, water and gas. On why we are locking down, vaccinating and masking the entire population if we have identified risk groups. On why the middle east got bombed nonstop just on rumors of weapons of mass destruction, bioweapons, etc.

Then these events happen at an incredible timing just to push these other things. Capitol Storming completely killed the discussion of the Covid Bill, while pushing and justifying various actions such as the banning of anyone that doesn't stand publicly as a leftist, or the demonization of conspiracy theorists with this event and the Nashville bombing. But to go even further, they both had security breaches that could have been easily avoided. Coincidences? You name it, I don't think so. I think ""Conspiracy theorists"" or better said ""alternative thinking"" goes next.

Again, who benefits from this? Results never lie. While the average citizens are poorer than ever, corporations are richer than ever (and they are only the visible face of this). So I ask you, who is your enemy? Your neighbour or these money and power hungry ladies and gentlemen that think that the end justifies the means?

Thing is they are playing a dangerous game, it is either all or nothing. They win power over everything or they loose everything and they have to start over. Because there is an incredible yet hidden truth in all this mess of a world.

**The truth is: They came up with a system, but that would be impossible if we don't support it.**

Why do you think small businesses and independent workers are targeted so hard during this pandemic while big corps are left alone with 0 control? Because it is a way to stop feeding the system and play by your own rules to a certain degree. They know that if we just stop buying their BS and we say ""no"", they are done. Their carefully crafted system to enrich them over time, will fall apart and it will be a pharaonical task to come up with another plan.

Their plan is to enslave every ""useful"" human being. Period. They already have much more money than they could spend in 10 lives, but they know it is fragile just because of the fact that their power is based on our compliance. **Make no mistake, neither you or your family will be an exception exempt from slavery in exchange from your compliance, now or in the future. It may be a privileged form of slavery, but slavery nonetheless. The moment you loose your ability to choose, you are a slave. Do as they dictate or you are fucked, IF they succeed.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I humbly and sincerely suggest you that you now change your perspective and start looking at the results from each event that happens, instead of ""gimme your source"" 24/7. Get real, noone is going to tell you ""Hey son I am trying to dominate the world and make every human a slave, can you help me?"" seriously. If you see what I see, you feel what I feel and want what I want (true freedom), start finding and taking action to live avoiding the support for a system that will sooner or later become our downfall and the rise of the psychopaths trying to shape the world at their will at the expense of billions suffering. Stop blaming your neighbours and help them out as much as you can. Let's remind these psychopaths that we are humans and we are free, and we are not giving them power ever again. This is solvable by just saying ""NO"".

**We are helping with building the bridges that we will sleep under.**

I don't really care about upvotes or downvotes or the insults that I will surely recieve from people that think that supporting this fucked up system is going to save them, I will gladly accept them. You don't get to decide who I am anyways. Besides, my only purpose is to call for reason and kindness that lies inside each one of you.

190,Trump to sign EO to remove federal funding from universities that allow BDS and anti Israel speech,181.0,e90fw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e90fw5/trump_to_sign_eo_to_remove_federal_funding_from/,141.0,1576029307.0,"SS: Most of the article

President Trump will sign an executive order defining Judaism as a nationality, not just a religion, thus bolstering the Education Department's efforts to stamp out ""Boycott Israel"" movements on college campuses.

“President Trump plans to sign an executive order on Wednesday targeting what he sees as anti-Semitism on college campuses by threatening to withhold federal money from educational institutions that fail to combat discrimination, three administration officials said on Tuesday.
The order will effectively interpret Judaism as a race or nationality, not just a religion, to prompt a federal law penalizing colleges and universities deemed to be shirking their responsibility to foster an open climate for minority students. In recent years, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions — or B.D.S. — movement against Israel has roiled some campuses, leaving some Jewish students feeling unwelcome or attacked.
In signing the order, Mr. Trump will use his executive power to take action where Congress has not, essentially replicating bipartisan legislation that has stalled on Capitol Hill for several years. Prominent Democrats have joined Republicans in promoting such a policy change to combat anti-Semitism as well as the boycott-Israel movement.
But critics complained that such a policy could be used to stifle free speech and legitimate opposition to Israel’s policies toward Palestinians in the name of fighting anti-Semitism. The definition of anti-Semitism to be used in the order matches the one used by the State Department and by dozens of other nations, but it has been criticized as too open-ended and sweeping.
For instance, it describes as anti-Semitic “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination,” and offers as an example of such behavior “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, said Mr. Trump was trying “to silence Palestinian rights activism” by equating opposition to Israeli treatment of Palestinians with anti-Semitism.
“Israeli apartheid is a very hard product to sell in America, especially in progressive spaces,” Mr. Munayyer said, “and realizing this, many Israeli apartheid apologists, Trump included, are looking to silence a debate they know they can’t win.”
Administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the order before its official announcement, said it was not intended to squelch free speech. The White House worked in tandem with some Democrats and activist groups that have been critical of the president to build support for the move.
Among those welcoming the move on Tuesday was Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, who said the group recorded its third-highest level of anti-Semitic episodes in the United States last year.
“Of course we hope it will be enforced in a fair manner,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is we see Jewish students on college campuses and Jewish people all over being marginalized. The rise of anti-Semitic incidents is not theoretical; it’s empirical.”

The meat industry is obviously fucking huge and the impact it has on the world is horrible. Whether you believe in climate change or not- you can't deny that the amount of water and land they use for animal agriculture is unbelievable. Gonna say - watch 'Cowspracy', 'Food INC', 'Food Matters' they are my favourite documentaries about the meat and food industry. Cowspiracy will explain in much better detail to what I'm getting at! But I just wanted to say that MEAT is a conspiracy!! I've not got anything against meat eaters(I don't myself) but I'm not here to try and convert you!!

Processed meat and warehouse farms are awful and eating too much of this can cause many problems! Obviously!! You're not all retarded!! But how I see it as is 
Too much meat + processed foods cause cancer, obesity, diabetes etc etc = $$$$$ pharmaceutical for a life long period. 
Animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change (see in cowspiracy) = they don't tell us this and then continue to make us buy energy efficient light bulbs, take short showers ect ect but the impact we have on global warming is absolutely miniscule compared to animal agriculture.

Disinformation agents in the conspiracy community have lead us all astray away from the truth with red herrings... like exotic scientific theories to explain how they say aliens make these advanced saucer technologies we could never understand. It's not aliens and it's not exotic science - disinformation agents like Bob Lazar... and Hal Puthoff and Dr. Steven Greer. By making us think these brilliant guys can't figure this out then we can't either.. It's all a lie to lead us away from the truth.

What I understand and that no one else does is that the repulsine does not use some exotic energy sources no one knows about. This is how I discovered this.. many years of studying the fundamentals of nature which are all incorporated in the repulsine. Plus with all the discoveries about nature we are making now which I believe is why the people in power are taking the actions they are. If this is understood by the scientific community and the masses everything changes.

This is why we have been dumbed down in every way - especially in science - for the last 80 years. The scientific community has been dumbed down as well and intimidated into ignoring anything ""fringe"" or it is career suicide. I studied science and technology my whole life completely outside of science for the same reason as Schauberger. I believe this is why I made these discoveries and why he did as well... same with Einstein - we were not constrained by group think.

&#x200B;

1. The Repulsine - The Repulsine is the most elegant, efficient and powerful device ever made by man. It encapsulates the highest understanding of nature ever produced and the lessons it teaches us provide the means to revolutionize our world from top to bottom.. but is the world ready for this kind of power?
2. Schauberger's repulsine was the first and only man made device to ever produce and harness antimatter. Arguably the most powerful force we can harness in nature. The equivalent of free energy.
3. Schauberger stated the key to his device was that it utilized something he called **implosion** ... the complete opposite of an explosion. Schauberger said engineers of our age think in a completely backwards way from nature which is why their technology is so out of harmony with nature and inefficient. It's fighting itself and nature.
4. Explosions are chaotic and destructive and completely inefficient. **Implosions** are the most natural movement of nature. The vortex is the key to the Repulsine.
5. Schauberger designed the Repulsine in a such a way to work with nature rather than against it. It had many many forces of nature working in a tiny space and working in total harmony.
6. It was a capacitor - which is a kind of battery in a sense. It stores electrical charges - positive and negative.
7. It was a particle accelerator. Particle accelerators accelerate nuclear particles to incredible speeds using electromagnetic fields. That is what this device did in a tiny space.
8. **Thunderstorms** are natural particle accelerators, capable of hurling electrons outward at nearly the speed of light. ... Prior work found that gamma rays from lightning can generate pairs of electrons and their positively charged **antimatter** counterparts, known as positrons.Nov 22, 2017
9. [https://www.nasa.gov/mission\_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html)  This link shows how particles are accelerated in storms to produce antimatter which reacts with normal matter to produce an incredible amount of energy. The Repulsine did this in such a minute manner it used this to generate power - essentially free energy.
10. It was said by the family of Schauberger that the device used gold as a catalyst. But it wasn't just a catalyst. Schauberger may have not realized this. When you fire a particle accelerator at gold it producers antimatter.  [https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100304/full/news.2010.108.html](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100304/full/news.2010.108.html)
11. Storms in nature produce lightning because they have an electrical charge and the Earth is an immense capacitor itself storing charge and this is what produces lightning. The same effect that is produced in the Repulsine.
12. The repulsine was a heat engine. Heat engines use heat (energy) to produce motion and then electricity. Antimatter produced in the repulsine would react with hydrogen also produced by the repulsine and produce heat. Because the repulsine worked like a vortex/tornado it would use this heat effect to produce motion.. which would then in turn produce more electricity.. and this cycle would repeat over and over again. Since the amount of antimatter needed to produce energy was so small a tiny amount of gold would be needed to produce energy making it appear as if no gold was consumed. Which is likely why Schauberger thought it was just a catalyst for the process. BUT Nickel can also be used in this process.
13. Pons and Fleischman  believed they discovered cold fusion using a reaction involving nickel. They were wrong that it was a cold fusion reaction.. but they stumbled on this big secret which is why they had to be discredited by the people in power. They actually discovered MUON CATALYZED fusion but didn't realize it. Muon catalyzed fusion is the same reaction Schauberger accidentally discovered. Both the repulsine and Pons and Fleischmann's reaction relied on accelerated particles - the repulsine produced its own. The P&F reaction relied on cosmic rays because they were in Utah at high altitude. Because P&F didn't realize this, if people tried to replicate their experiments at a lower altitude the effect wouldn't be produced.
14. When Pons and Fleischmann discovered what they did they went to the Department of Energy - the DOE - before they went public. The government then set out to discredit P&F before they could realize what they discovered.
15. Schuaberger's repulsine also worked like a jet engine. Schauberger may have been the first person to invent the jet engine which was also invented by a British engineer around the same time. The Nazis likely used Schauberger's design as a basis for their own jet engine invention. He was forced to work for the Nazis in WWII
16. Bob Lazar, a government disinformation agent, came forward at the exact same time as Pons and Fleischmann went public with their cold fusion discovery. Bob Lazar said the alien saucer he witnessed used an advanced powerplant that used an element that couldn't be produced by man to produce antimatter. This was the lie to take people off the trail the P&F cold fusion experiment would have put them onto.
17. When science discovered Schaubergers work at the end of WWII in the US they started a movement based on it in science called biomimicry... Where you study living creatures and nature and apply it to technology.
18. The Nazi Bell was a device made by the Germans in WWII where they took the essence of the repulsine and made a more reliable and larger version of the Schauberger's repulsine. The Bell used thorium in a mercury solution and rotated this releasing radiation that created the capacitor effect which creates antigravity or electrogravitics. At the end of WWII the allies found huge stockpiles of thorium but didn't know its purpose. This was the purpose.
19. The Foo fighters were small glowing objects Allied pilots saw over Nazi Germany on aerial missions. The Foo Fighters were the first known use of a version of the Repulsine.
20. Viktor Schauberger and another scientist named Thomas Townsend Brown both discovered the secret to antigravity technology around the same time completely independently. But TT Brown did not have the incredible power source Schauberger did to power his device.
21. The Repulsine worked very well as an antigravity device but it was not very reliable. It was more temperamental based on climate and conditions. TT Browns device was more reliable but the effect was very small so it was not easy to prove emphatically that it was in fact an antigravity device. Even to this day people claim it was using an ion effect to produce propulsion.
22. I suspect the Nazis may have even figured out the key to how the repulsine was producing an antigravity effect by looking at TT Browns patents on electrogravitics.
23. A report on electrogravitics based on TT Browns work -  [https://starburstfound.org/aerospace/projectwinterhaven.pdf](https://starburstfound.org/aerospace/projectwinterhaven.pdf)
24. This is the book The Hunt for Zero Point by Nick Cook you can read online -  [http://plain2.tripod.com/huntforzeropoint.pdf](http://plain2.tripod.com/huntforzeropoint.pdf)  This is a great primer on the suppressed history of antigravity tech. BUT this was written many years ago and there is mis or dis information in the book. Zero point energy was not the source of energy - if zero point energy is even real. There are other things that aren't accurate but it is the best source I know of to give people a good history on all of this.
25. Paul La Violette wrote a book about how TTBrowns electrogravitics worked based on information TTBrowns daughter gave him. The book is called Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion. The information in that book allowed me to decode how the repulsine worked. But this is not easy to understand unless you learn all the info about how the repulsine was designed and Viktor Schauberger's clues about his philosophy for building it. Which I am providing here. This is why no one had put these pieces together before.

I know we're all busy. We have lives, social, family and work that we want to focus on. That's understandable, but I would take a few minutes every day and question what information you read and why you might be reading it.  

We're in a new day and age. A new normal of constant information at our fingertips. It's overwhelming and confusing. But the links are there folks, and what seems innocent or just everyday run of the mill new normal, wouldn't have been normal 20 years ago. Event's are increasing and our comprehension is decreasing, and that’s not good.     


>The intersections between geopolitics and digital media are most evident when one observes flows of digital code that carry explicitly geopolitical messages and imagery. However, data flows that are not initially relevant to geopolitics also get drawn into political processes such as elections, referendums, diplomacy and international relations through the convergence of social media, digital surveillance, and the proliferation of databases. These processes operate within state borders but also cross borders in slippery ways, blending mediatized politics and geopolitics.   

Realizing that geopolitics can be carried out through the public media is key to understanding or interpreting current events. Governments don't always pick up the phone and talk. Not in the information age, supercomputers, and AI data collection. They don’t need to. They can simply make sure that the message is hidden in plain sight, and AI presents the data to a human analyst for interpretation. The message doesn't have to be coded if nobody knows the message is from the government.    

So let's follow the white rabbit down the hole and see how deep this can go.     


>The U.S. Pacific Command has detected a missile threat to Hawaii. A missile may impact on land or sea within minutes. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. If you are indoors, stay indoors. If you are outdoors, seek immediate shelter in a building. Remain indoors well away from windows. If you are driving, pull safely to the side of the road and seek shelter in a building or lay on the floor. We will announce when the threat has ended. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Take immediate action measures.      


Could you imagine seeing this message? I couldn't, and yet there it was on January 13th for all the citizens of Hawaii. Have a beer, hug your wife, and kiss your ass goodbye.     

Fack.    

As we all now know, it was fake. Thank god and pass the nachos, right? Let's get back to new normal and keep calm and carry on.   

Not. So. Fast.   

>A former Hawaii state worker who sent a false missile alert last month said on Friday he was devastated about causing panic but had been “100% sure” at the time that the attack was real. 
State officials have said other workers clearly heard the word “exercise” repeated several times.        
The Hawaii emergency management agency fired the worker after the incident. His superiors said they knew for years he had problems performing his job. The worker had mistakenly believed drills for tsunami and fire warnings were actual events and colleagues were not comfortable working with him, the state said.    


Ah. Right. Gotcha. He's Homer Simpson. Nobody wanted to work with him. I get it. There's always that one guy who just doesn't get it, right?    


>His supervisors counseled him but kept him for a decade in a position that had to be renewed each year, authorities said. The ex-worker disputed that, saying he was not aware of any performance problems.        


He's so incompetent that he wasn't aware of any performance problems. Screw ups don't know they're screw ups, right?    


>While starting a Saturday shift at the emergency operations center in a former bunker in Honolulu’s Diamond Head crater on 13 January, the man said, a co-worker took a phone call over the US Pacific Command secure line that sounded like a real warning, he said.
“When the phone call came in, someone picked up the receiver instead of hitting speakerphone so that everyone could hear the message,” he said. The man said he did not hear the beginning of the message that said “exercise, exercise, exercise”.
“I heard the part, ‘this is not a drill”,’ he said. “I didn’t hear exercise at all in the message or from my co-workers.”       


Hmmmm. That's strange, isn't it. He's pretty adamant. So let's go deeper.   


>An October 2017 email from the University of Hawaii to students with the subject line ""In the event of a nuclear attack"", containing instructions from the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency on how to react in case of a nuclear attack, caused controversy; a university spokesman ultimately apologized for ""any needless concern it may have caused"".     


Ok, so now we had a mistakenly sent out report from the University in the previous months. Homer must be working overtime to make ends meet.   


>Testing of the civil defense warning sirens and attack drills were also conducted in the state on the first business day of the month beginning in December 2017. On December 1, 2017, a nuclear threat siren was tested in Hawaii for the first time in more than 30 years, the first of what state officials said would be monthly drills. At 11:45 a.m. on January 2, 2018, the state conducted its monthly test of the civil defense outdoor warning siren system including the sounding of a one-minute Attention Alert Signal (Steady Tone) followed by a one-minute Attack Warning Signal (Wailing Tone). There was no exercise or drill accompanying the test. Prior to January 13, 2018, [26 drills had been conducted.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hawaii_false_missile_alert&ved=2ahUKEwjG-NiHw8DqAhXlmXIEHY6gAsgQFjAIegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1TxjZIjJ8X6bFHablfuOXG)     


So there had been no exercise or drill accompanying the test, and the test had already been run on Jan 2nd. Something doesn't smell right here.    



>First Hawaii, now Japan sends a false alarm about incoming [North Korean missile.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/first-hawaii-now-japan-sends-a-false-alarm-about-incoming-north-korean-missile/2018/01/16/d8961ef4-fac1-11e7-b832-8c26844b74fb_story.html%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwjG-NiHw8DqAhXlmXIEHY6gAsgQFjAJegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw2zx0HGofn3L0F5oLoq8KXs&ampcf=1)       


Homer Simpson must really need the money, right? Flying all the way over to Japan to make some Yen.   

I know what you're thinking here. He's going to tell us that it was a real missle attack, right? Omg Becky, we're all gonna die! Hold on and calm down, it's not quite the day after tomorrow yet. But the Doomsday Clock is ticking.    


**Doomsday Clock Now Closer to Midnight Than Ever in Its History**.     

>As the statement issued today by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists explains: “Humanity continues to face two simultaneous existential dangers—nuclear war and climate change—that are compounded by a threat multiplier, **cyber-enabled information warfare, that undercuts society’s ability to respond**. The international security situation is dire, not just because these threats exist, but because world leaders have allowed the international political infrastructure for managing them to erode.”     


Hmmm. That's interesting, isn’t it? Maybe I'll peruse the headlines around that time and see what turns up.     


>NY TIMES.

WASHINGTON — A newly drafted United States nuclear strategy that has been sent to President Trump for approval would permit the use of nuclear weapons to respond to a wide range of devastating but non-nuclear attacks on American infrastructure, including what current and former government officials described as the most crippling kind of cyberattacks.
For decades, American presidents have threatened “first use” of nuclear weapons against enemies in only very narrow and limited circumstances, such as in response to the use of biological weapons against the United States. But the new document is the first to expand that to include attempts to destroy wide-reaching infrastructure, like a country’s power grid or communications, that would be [most vulnerable to cyberweapons.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/us/politics/pentagon-nuclear-review-cyberattack-trump.amp.html&ved=2ahUKEwiUqeqGz8DqAhVll3IEHVfHDgUQFjAAegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw10QpZbIUAPQ-_mI59AgLlj&ampcf=1)    
The draft document, called the Nuclear Posture Review, was written at the Pentagon and is being reviewed by the White House. Its final release is expected in the coming weeks and represents a new look at the United States’ nuclear strategy. The draft was first published [last week by HuffPost.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-nuclear-posture-review-2018_n_5a4d4773e4b06d1621bce4c5)       


Isn't it nice of the NY TIMES to also post this article in Chinese? This is what the characters read at the top. Read simplified Chinese version   Read traditional Chinese version.     

**I'm dreaming of a nuclear Christmas, just like we've never had before**.   

So we had a missle alert on January 13th, another one in Japan on January 16th, and then the NY TIMES publishes an article about a nuclear response in retaliation for cyberattacks?    
I'm sure you've figured out that those alerts were Chinese Cyberattacks, haven't you? Which were probably in response to the HuffPost article about increasing low yield nuclear warheads so that they could be used instead of the really big ones. Safer, right. Sure is, considering the low yield ones are still the same size as the bombs dropped on Japan in WW2. I strongly recommend reading the links to get a better grasp on the new normal version of, how I stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb.   
  


####USA       


**Oct. 3, 2018** · The alert, at 2:18 p.m. Wednesday, was the first nationwide test of a wireless emergency alert system, designed to warn of a major disaster.       


####Canada.

That's, **AHEM**, alarming, isn't it? We have an apparent cyberattack on our infrastructure and then we start testing our emergency alert systems. All of us. We're all in this together, right?

We have to pay attention to the words used and when they were used, only then can we understand why they were used. You can’t just look at one link in the chain, you have to look at all the links and what the chain links are hooked on to. 

Ok. Are you ready? Because unfortunately we aren't done yet. Not. Even. Close. Make sure you're cars gas tanks are always close to full, and that you have an exit plan. Strap in and hold on, because our situation is worse than it seems. 

####False Emergency Alarm System Warnings.    
**2017 - 2020**.     


Those are a lot of false alarms, aren’t they? It almost feels like another country is trying to break our feeling of keep calm and carry on by making our defenses cry wolf so many times that we ignore the warnings, right? Chicken little can only tell you the sky is falling so many times before you tune it out.    

But the sky is falling, and unfortunately it doesn’t look like it's going to stop. It doesn't feel real, does it? It feels like a movie or a Netflix series, doesn't it? And that entertainment whether by design or accident, leaves a haze of illusion under current events that prevents us from taking it seriously.  

I know this post is long, but it has to be. The Emergency Alert System is vital. It's the modern day caveman equivalent to seeing smoke signals. If that's broken, our lives are in danger. Let me show you how bad the hacking of our EAS really is.   

**May 25, 2017**.

**The National Weather Service’s** National Tsunami Warning Center issued a “routine test message” around 8:30 a.m., and the message was released by “at least one private sector company” as an official tsunami warning, Susan Buchanan, spokeswoman for the weather service said in an email. She didn’t identify the company.

**HONOLULU, Hawaii** (HawaiiNewsNow) -The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center is investigating a false tsunami alert that startled some Tuesday.
Although it didn’t cause widespread panic, the rumor caught the attention of the agency and was enough for them to issue a correction via twitter.

**Many Alaska residents** were mistakenly warned on TV and on the radio Friday morning of a tsunami threat along the West Coast of the United States, from San Diego to Alaska's Aleutian islands.
The alert said at the end of a nearly two-minute long message that it was a test. But not all listeners and viewers received that information, officials said.
Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service spokeswoman, said the centre's test message was properly coded but somehow re-transmitted in an abbreviated format. That stripped the test coding and caused activation of the Emergency Alert System that sends [messages to TV and radio stations.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/alaska-residents-get-false-tsunami-alert-on-tv-radio-1.3926220&ved=2ahUKEwjx0rzm6cHqAhWvmHIEHZTwDWcQFjAQegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw2FS_pwmQ5882v6mVdO2CN1&cshid=1594354933548)

Now what are the odds that all of these happen in such a short time frame? This isn't a coincidence. All of these aren't human errors. They are covering up the real story trying to prevent mass panic over the big picture. If we have history books in twenty years you'll read the truth. Or you can read about the new normal here. 

But we have to take current events seriously. Our lives have become the new normal version of, **how I stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb**. We're rapidly approaching a time of crop losses and food scarcity because of the environment collapse. This is what the great power struggle will be over, natural resources. **It's a winner take all game**. Rich people don't build Doomsday Bunkers just for the hell of it.

That’s a great NY Times crossword puzzle, isnt it? You should already know that I believe they use the media to communicate hidden in plain sight, and this is one of them. 

Do you know what I don’t welcome? A nuclear war. That can't happen any time soon, right? Nah. Not with the COVID-19 pandemic. Nobody would do that, would they? Our world leaders can't be that crazy?

Oh. Not good. Not good at all. It looks like we may have to climb this mountain of madness at some point after all. At least the rest of us are all in this new normal together. Just not in Doomsday Bunkers, like the ""best"" of us. 

Everything that I've read over the last few days is reinforcing how perilous our current times are. I've been finding connections in headlines that I didn't even know were significant when I read them years ago. I will post everything that I've found as soon as I can. Don't get sucked into any conspiracy theory art performances. The pedophile connections might be real, or they might not be, but ask yourself, will that knowledge help you navigate through the hard times ahead? The answer is no. There is a lot of information that I have to share in the coming weeks, and unfortunately none of it is positive. 

The best advice that I can leave you is to have a plan. Have some known knowns. Minimize the known unknowns. Figure out what the unknown knowns will be. And deal with the unknown unknowns as they come. We can't ever he one hundred percent prepared, but we can prepare, and even a little preparation goes a long way. 
Have some extra portable food and water. Keep some clothes packed. Have an idea of where to go and who to go with. I don't know when or what will happen first, but something is going to happen, and you want to be ahead of this ""game"" when the **happening, happens**.   

Take care. Be safe. Stay aware and be prepared.  
Talk soon.

199,Stoned Ape Theory: Terence McKenna's fascinating theories and observations is his explanation for the origin of the human mind and human culture,171.0,5tg7sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5tg7sy/stoned_ape_theory_terence_mckennas_fascinating/,58.0,1486834252.0,"Perhaps the most intriguing of Terence McKenna's fascinating theories and observations is his explanation for the origin of the human mind and human culture.

To summarize: McKenna theorizes, for instance, that synesthesia (the blurring of boundaries between the senses) caused by psilocybin led to the development of spoken language: the ability to form pictures in another person's mind through the use of vocal sounds.

About 12,000 years ago, further climate changes removed the mushroom from the human diet, resulting in a new set of profound changes in our species as we reverted to pre-mushroomed and frankly brutal primate social structures that had been modified and/or repressed by frequent consumption of psilocybin.

McKenna's theory has great appeal and intuitive strength, but it is necessarily based on a great deal of supposition interpolating between the few fragmentary facts we know about hominid and early human history. In addition, because McKenna (who describes himself as ""an explorer, not a scientist"") is also a proponent of much wilder suppositions, such as his ""Timewave Zero"" theory, his more reasonable theories are usually disregarded by the very scientists whose informed criticism is crucial for their development.

Cut down on military pollution - US military pollution is a significant contributor to climate change. If it were a nation state, it would be the 47th largest emitter in the world. Their negligence, nuclear testing and disregard for human life has come at a huge environmental cost, and reform needs to be taken into consideration to protect our planet.

In each case, the result of planned obsolescence is higher levels of electronic-waste. E-waste, often containing toxic substances, can leach toxins such as heavy metals into the groundwater, thereby negatively affecting the water supply. When exposed to heat, such as in illegal e-waste burning, e-waste becomes a major cause of air pollution and increased levels of air particulate matter. The various environmental effects associated with planned obsolescence and its consequent uptick in e-waste should greatly concern society as it puts the health of millions at risk.

This accounts for more than 25% of solid waste. The discarded paper accounts for 34% of municipal trash.

Welcome back earthlings. Let's take another look at Terra Firma and our present chances of First Contact, shall we?    


#Flatten the Curve     


I first started writing this series because I noticed inconsistencies and over looked current events, namely, the world wide reports of a distinct sulfur smell around the world. These reports aren't easy to find in search engines, and it took me a number of weeks before I convinced myself that something was happening worldwide that was being kept hidden from us.  Flatten the Curve post on sulfur. [Source Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h0ekzp/flatten_the_curve_part_14_rotten_egg_mystery/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Back then I became convinced that this was part of an ELE that we were going to face in the future. And while the odds remain firmly with that explanation, another possibility has entered into the **scenario**. What's the possibility?Whelp, hold on to your tinfoil hats;     



#UFO's      


Hold up, back up, this isn't normal New Normal stuff. And you're right, it isn't. Not at all. And trust me, even I'm in disbelief over what I've seen. But maybe I shouldn't have been.    


Why?    


Because of some strangeness that happened after the first sulfur post. Because after that post, I received a few strange comments or private messages. I can't remember which it was, but I think it was comments, so if you're interested to verify, go back and check (if those comments are still up, because I had an unusually high number of deleted comments back then, and maybe I still do, but I don't know and I don't care.) So what were the comments about? They pointed out to me that a high number of UFO sightings also happened to coincide with the smell of sulfur. Which I thought was nuts. I had read books about UFO sightings as a little kid. A lot of books. And I didn't remember reading that once. And I thought that I would have.    


#I was wrong     


Now, I don't know who sent me that first UFO and sulfur hint. But I will say, that was strange. Very strange. And I should have looked into it. But I didn't. Why? Because that wasn't what I thought was happening, that's why. Despite the tic tac video. And then that report came out about the not of this world material. And I ignored it. And then I started seeing more and more UFO reports, and I finally decided to search sulfur + UFO, and surprise, surprise, nothing. So I kept searching, and guess what, it was exactly like my experience trying to find the sulfur reports; the info is there, but you have to dig to find it.    


Now I don't have a lot of information, mainly because there are more pressing issues to write about, but I will keep looking in my spare time. So for now, let's start at the sulfur reports.      

(Seriously, I'm still wondering what on earth has happened to Normal, because I'm not a fan of this movie script)    


#Aliens Stink Like Uranus     


Get it? Becaue Uranus has hydrogen sulfide...   





>FalconLake         
Then there was the smell.
""When I walked into the bedroom there was a huge stink in the room, like a real horrible aroma of sulphur and burnt motor. It was all around and it was coming out of his pores. It was bad,"" said Michalak, who co-authored the book When They Appeared with Winnipeg UFO researcher Chris Rutkowski.     
Believing it to be a secret U.S.military experimental craft, Stefan sat back and sketched it over the next half hour. Then he decided to approach, later recalling the warm air and smell of sulphur as he got closer, as well as a whirring sound of motors and a hissing of air. [Source Here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/falcon-lake-incident-book-anniversary-1.4121639)      


Did you notice the sulfur smell? Now let's go on and take another look at the East coast of Canada.    


Then there was Shag Harbor [Source Here](https://youtu.be/vSG_4OBFbr4)


And now onto Cussac.   


>On Aug. 29, 1967, a 13-year-old boy and his 9-year-old sister told local police they were watching cows in a field and saw ""four small black beings about 47 inches tall"" who appeared to rise in the air and enter ""a round spaceship, about 15 feet in diameter"" that was hovering over the field. The police noted ""sulfur odor and the dried grass"" at the place where the sphere was alleged to have taken off. [Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_encounter_of_Cussac)    



And West Virginia.     


>On a steep hillside, a bevy of youngsters drawn away from a game of sandlot football, along with some adults, were shaken out of their shoes by the spectacle of a 12-foot, metallic object that emanated a pungent odor of sulfur and made sounds that reminded one witness of bacon sizzling in a fry pan.

And the last one is perhaps the strangest.    


>Bender’s message did not go over well. His rooms continued to fill with the smell of sulphur and he was telepathically ordered to cease delving into matters that were not his concern. A yellow mist gathered in the attic. Undeterred, Bender announced that the July issue of Space Review would hold a “startling revelation.” It never appeared in print.
In July 1953 Albert Bender was visited at his home by three men. Bender stated “All of them were dressed in black clothes. They looked like clergymen but wore hats similar to [the]Homburg style.” The notorious Men In Black, always in threes, made it clear to Bender that he was to immediately halt all UFO work. They communicated telepathically: “Stop publishing.” Before departing, the MIB confiscated copies of Space Review and in their wake a yellow fog materialized in the upstairs rooms of 784 Broad Street. Again, the vile odor of sulphur wafted through the attic. Unnerved by their other-worldly presence Albert shuddered that he was “scared to death” and was unable to eat for days. The 32 year-old timekeeper would be the recipient of repeated MIB visits.
The telepathic messages, headaches, his being stalked, and of course the surreal warnings by authoritarians in black suits, compelled Albert to shut down the International Flying Saucer Bureau. A year and a half after founding the IFSB the final issue of Space Review was released in October, 1953. It included a cryptic message, and warning: “The mystery of the flying saucers is no longer a mystery. The source is already known but any information about this is being withheld by orders from a higher source. We would like to print the full story in Space Review but because of the nature of the information we have been advised in the negative. We advise those engaged in saucer work to be very cautious.

Out of this admittedly small collection, there are a couple points that I noticed. They all happened years ago, and a couple incidents are near water. Now that's not a big deal, and because of my limited examples, I can't make a big deal out of it. But.         


#Do we have Extraterrestrials under water?      


The Tic Tac video. That sure got...barely any attention. Strange, right? Almost like everyone is being conditioned to accept news like that as normal. As though our natural born instincts are being dulled. Because real or not, come on, this is a modern day spotting a sabretooth tiger moment, and we don't think it's a big enough declaration to have it on our radar? Really? Ok. Sure. But. If very few people are talking about that incident, they are really not talking about something else Farvor said.    


>“They reverse the winch and the diver’s thinking, ‘What the hell is going on?’ And all of a sudden he said the torpedo just got sucked down underwater, and the object just descended back down into the depths. They never recovered it.”     
The helicopter pilot swears the torpedo didn’t sink, per Fravor—and that pilot even told the Times about the incident back in 2017, but the paper never reported it. We’re guessing the editors would reconsider today.      
As the pilot picked up the BQM, he was apparently at a loss for words. “He’s looking at this thing going, ‘What the hell is that?’ And then it just goes back down underwater. Once they pull the kid and the BQM out of the water, this object descends back into the depths.”
One dark mass coming up from the depths is weird enough. Two is officially cause for concern. A few months later, the helicopter pilot saw the exact same thing.
>>“He’s out picking up a torpedo, they hook the diver up on the winch, and as they’re lowering him down, he sees this big mass. He goes, ‘It’s not a submarine’. He’s seen submarines before. Once you’ve seen a submarine you can’t confuse it with something else. This big object, kind of circular, is coming up from the depths and he starts screaming through the intercom system to tell them to pull the diver up, and the diver’s only a few feet from the water.

It's a little more common knowledge now, but it definitely wasn't back then. And if we go over to the Russians (apparently, thanks New Normal Fake News for the constant barrage of disinformation) and what they released.    


>**2009** • Russian Navy Declassifies Cold War Close Encounters. Great catch by Phil Ewing at Navy Times‘ Scoop Deck blog: the Russian navy has just declassified its records of Cold War UFO sightings. Turns out “50 percent of UFO encounters are connected with oceans. Fifteen [percent] more — with lakes. So UFOs tend to stick to the water,” one Russian officer explained. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2009/07/russian-navy-declassifies-cold-war-close-encounters/)        


So now we have Russia and the USA reporting about UFO sightings. And the wall fell just a few short years after Gorbachev and Reagan decided to talk about UFO's and world peace in 1985. So now let's go back to 1984.    


>Conspiracy theorists believe that the closing ceremony from the 1984 Olympic Games ‘prepared the world for an alien invasion’    
The bizarre closing ceremony at the Los Angeles Games raised eyebrows at the time, but alien enthusiasts still claim that the Olympic event had a more sinister purpose.

Whelp. What. Was. That? Seriously? And then we had the music from Space Odyssey 2001 playing. Kind of coincidental with all of our current Monoliths and signals from Jupiter, isn't it? Flatten the Curve. Part    [Source Here](
And here's the crazy aspect, I found that 1984 Olympics clip after noticing our current events invoking themes from the movie. 


>**1984 NY Times** • The public hearing was plodding along routinely at the Town Hall one night last month.    
''All of a sudden, a cop burst in yelling: 'The U.F.O.'s here! The U.F.O.'s here!' '' said Peter A. Brandenberg, a 43-year-old real-estate developer. ''Everyone jumped up and jolted out. We went flying down the stairs to see this thing, just staring at it.''    
On a night before that, William A. Pollard was driving along Interstate 84 near Brewster. 'Whoa! Wait a Minute Here'    
''My neighbors said they had seen something,'' said Mr. Pollard, 29, the manager of an automobile service center. ''I said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.' I never believed in that stuff. But off in a field I saw this gigantic triangle with lights, about 30 feet off the ground - hovering. Then it turned off its lights and shot straight up - straight up. That's when I said, 'Whoa! Wait a minute here.' ''    
Throughout northern Westchester County, Dutchess and Putnam Counties and western Connecticut this summer, thousands of residents have reported strange objects in the sky - each usually in a V-shape or a circle, about the size of a football field, absolutely noiseless and outlined in brilliant lights of white, red or green. [Source Here](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/nyregion/strange-sights-brighten-the-night-skies-upstate.html)      


And there are more prominent UFO reports in 1984. So let's get this straight. We have major sightings in 1984 and then we have a UFO show at the 1984 Olympics. Ok. But then we have Jimmy Carter in 1976.    


>During the 1976 presidential campaign, Carter pledged that, if elected, he would encourage the government to make public “every piece of information” about UFOs. Once in office, however, he said releasing some of this information could have adverse “defense implications” and pose a threat to national security. [Source Here](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/18/this-day-in-politics-096937)       


And then next year we have Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977. And then Spielberg goes on to direct ET in 1982. My point? There seems to be a previous attempt to make Aliens look pretty benign and altruistic. That was followed up by the Summer Olympics UFO show, which honestly makes no sense at all. In the slightest. Not back then. Because unlike now, only crackpots and Conspiracy theorists believed in Aliens. So why the show? Was this a coordinated attempt to get us ready or to deceive us, because I find it hard to believe that the President of the United States in 1985 just blurted out UFO in 1985 as a metaphor.        


Let's keep digging and see if we can find more water.     


#Missing 411      


What is that doing in here when we're talking about UFO's? Good question, let me show you.   


>They are clustered in certain areas, particularly **around bodies of water** and in national parks. If the people are found alive, they often have memory loss. If they are found dead, the cause of death is hard to determine. The people are sometimes found in an area it seems they could not have reached by foot, or they are found in a location that has already been thoroughly searched.

 Memory loss. Bodies of water. The authorities don't keep a tally of missing people. Dive into it, because something strange is going on, and ot sounds just like an alien abduction would. Are the 411 cases dealing with extraterrestrial incidents? Food for thought, because we're about to go off the deep end. Ready?    



#Enders Game and the Three Body Problem     


A while back I shared a photo of Rita Wilson that caught my attention. It was a picture of her reading, Enders Game. [Source Here](https://images.app.goo.gl/Jquin8Qzg3Q23vLy9)     


And Enders game just so happens to be a novel about humanity waging a war with Aliens. And the picture was oddly getting a lot of traction, **HEY LOOK AT THIS PICTURE!**   


Now let's go into the Dark Forest.    


>What are some of those books?    
It’s interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things — some science fiction. For a while, there was a three-volume science-fiction novel, the “Three-Body Problem” series —     
Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.
— which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting. It wasn’t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping —
It’s really about the fate of the universe.
Exactly. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty — not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade. [Laughter]
[Source Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/transcript-president-obama-on-what-books-mean-to-him.amp.html)     


When Aliens are about to invade. Ha. Ha. Ha. Pretty funny. Right. But then it gets stranger, because it's not just Obama, but our other favorite alien, Mark Zuckerberg.     


#When Obama and Zuckerberg are your fan boys: On Cixin Liu’s ‘Remembrance of Earth’s Past’ Trilogy


>In his Remembrance of Earth’s Past series, Liu doesn’t value this idea enough to even pay it lip service. Organizing earth for a centuries-long project of developing the tools to fight a coming invasion is, in his telling, work exclusively reserved for large planning committees of technical experts given global mandates and staggering resources. In short, it’s a job only properly suited for the nascent technocratic class that has held increasing sway in our world in the last ~30–40 years (and which Liu himself, as a computer engineer in China, is tacitly a part of).    
The humanity presented within these books is a humanity of government conferences, scientific laboratories and U.N. resolutions. It’s a humanity that is contained and constrained utterly within a world of technical and logistical problem solving. In short, the humanity presented in these books is purely that of a technocratic elite.We live in an age in which the gap between those with technical skills and those without is widening. Our ideas of affluence and upward mobility are increasingly colored not simply by who possesses wealth, but also by who possesses specific types of knowledge and skills. Cixin Liu has written a remarkable science fiction epic which also, perhaps unknowingly, serves as a warning. A world in which a globally empowered technocratic class controls everything is a world that can achieve remarkable outcomes. But it is, by its very nature, a sterile world; one in which the overwhelming majority of human life and experience is a mere afterthought in a plenary session.

One • Tom and Rita Wilson, Zuckerbuffon, and Obama love to have their picture taken in the water. As in, they we're all prominently featured recently. [Zuckerberg](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F07%2FMarkZ-96c7.jpg%3Fquality%3D90%26strip%3Dall&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2020%2F07%2F20%2Fmark-zuckerberg-goes-surfing-full-face-sunscreen-internet-has-thoughts-13013924%2F&tbnid=KvK-lgpO3clC4M&vet=1&docid=Nkaw8WKPSMit8M&w=1260&h=662&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)

Could they all just be innocent photos. Yes. Are they? More than likely, yes. But, what if they're signals for people who understand? After all, you don't want that kind of information written down, do you? But why Tom Hanks? Fracked if I know! But his appearance in all this crap just doesn't stop. Now he's appearing with Biden at the inauguration? Really? I mean Zuckerberg looks alien, so maybe Tom is too! Just joking (I think). I honestly have no idea why the Bosom Buddy is right into this New Normal. 

But.   


>Darkforest is a computer go program developed by Facebook, based on deep learning techniques using a convolutional neural network.

The MCTS effectively takes tree search methods commonly seen in computer chess programs and randomizes them. With the update, the system is known as Darkfmcts3.

Ok. We know that Zuckerdork loves the novel. Sure. But he loves it enough to name his AI computer after the book? Words matter. A lot. And while this is all just probably a coincidence, **what if** it isn't? All the reports about underwater objects. All the photos of the three of them in the ocean. Facebook’s AI being called the Dark Forest. The monoliths that are striking me as more than a natural occurrence. The UFO around the sun during the 2012 solar flare? The sudden surge to protect the energy grid? The sulfur reports and the early reports of smell around UFO activity? All the recent reports about drones being casually dismissed as nothing.      



>Observations of mysterious drones spotted in northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska were first reported in December 2019.[1] The drones were described as having blinking lights and a wingspan of about six feet (1.8 m). According to the Denver Post, the drones flew in groups of six to 10 and were usually seen between 7 and 10 pm. The sheriff of Phillips County, Colorado described the formation as ""a grid search"" and stated that the size and number of drones makes it unlikely that they are being operated by hobbyists. One witness in Palisade, Nebraska counted 19 drones at one time, some hovering and others flying in formations in small groups.

Look. Something is going on these days. Something big. What? Now that's the big question, isn’t it?    


Could all the posturing about war be about moving military units around? What about the environmental catastrophe they keep moving closer, not to mention the amount of prominent scientists who claim the numbers aren't adding up for them, including Freeman Dyson.   


>Freeman Dyson was a physics professor known for his work in the area of electrodynamics. Dyson formerly worked as a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He passed away at 96 years old in February 2020.     
According to Dyson's profile at the Institute for Advanced Study, “His most useful contribution to science was the unification of the three versions of quantum electrodynamics invented by Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga. Cornell University made him a professor without bothering about his lack of Ph.D.” 
[Source Here](https://www.desmogblog.com/freeman-dyson)   


You know, the guy who came up with the concept of the Dyson sphere.     


So if the numbers aren't adding up, but the military is making operational strategy changes to cope with abrupt climate change, something is obviously happening, isn't it? The military doesn't just institute changes for nothing. So is the environment being manipulated bu outside entities? Is that why they're suddenly worried about the power grid?     


And what about the by now obvious Covid-19 deaths that are predominantly among seniors. Is it to clean out the hospitals for the upcoming encounter? Before you say no, just remember that a no regrets strategy was actually proposed in a military scenario paper on abrupt climate change.  

Here's the definition:    


>No-Regrets"" Approach: ""No-regrets"" actions are actions by households, communities, and local/national/international institutions that can be justified from economic, and social, and environmental perspectives whether natural hazard events or climate change (or other hazards) take place or not. ""No-regrets"" actions increase resilience, which is the ability of a ""system"" to deal with different types of hazards in a timely, efficient, and equitable manner.  Increasing resilience is the basis for sustainable growth in a world of multiple hazards (see Heltberg, Siegel, Jorgensen, 2009; UNDP, 2010). 


If you would like to read the paper, I do have it linked on Flatten the Curve under Peter Schwartz.      


Is this what were seeing? A no regrets approach  in action in anticipation of first contact? Is this what they mean by the New Normal? Is this why they're trying to establish a one world government? So we can work together to get ready? Is this why there's an overflow of informational leaks like Moloch worshipers, or Russian Fake News, and on and on. Is it to keep us off balance from the real threat? And could they be so advanced that they're attempting to circumvent our progress through manipulating our planet? Is this why we have so many nukes? Is this why they want to weaponize space? 


I'm not saying that my running hypothesis has changed, but I am saying that looking at events from a different perspective can only help. And seriously, right now, I would be lying if I didn't admit that I would be relieved if they weren't a bunch of psychopathic greedy AI loving nutjobs.    Which I still think they are, because even if Mars Attacks, or we have War of the Worlds, or Independence Day, I'll still have to see them face to face. Why. One word. Deepfake.     


So let's consider a few points before I sign off. We have sulfur reports. Early reports linking sulfur to the UFO phenomenon. An increase in UFO reports. The government disclosing incident reports. Warnings about a possible grid failure through cyberattack or solar flare. Abrupt Climate Change. A No Regrets Strategy for Climate Change. A virus that seems to hit those who would be the biggest burden on the health care system. A worldwide hum and Sky Trumpets. The Pentagon commissioning reports about riot control and then funding training into underground warfare. And we have reports about underwater UFO's and older Conspiracy theories about Aliens living underground.    


So, real or fake, I don't think we should discount the possibility that something may occur that could just knock the world's perception of reality.         


And trust me, I still don't believe this is likely. Why? Well I find it pretty coincidental that H.G. Wells not only wrote War of the Worlds, but he also wrote a book called New World Order. And he also collaborated with Julian S. Huxley, a known eugenics supporter and brother of Aldous Huxley of a Brave New World fame.    


Alright, long story short, I'm not saying it's aliens, but it's....yeah. Buckle up and just be ready, because if our New Normal is based on a No Regrets Strategy, our strategy has to become a No Trust Strategy.

I work, I went to college, I drive the speed limit, I pay taxes, and I don't terroristically plot.  I've been following conspiracies for a little over two years now and have found many convincing clues to the world we are living in/about to live in.  What clues?  $222 trillion dollar fiscal gap, disarming of citizens, DHS bulking up on ammo, DHS trying to pass FEMA camps, CISPA, NDAA, the entire eastern hemisphere is on the brink of war/nuclear war, massive climate change, frequent drone usage, assassinations: the list goes on.  I have a feeling the economy is going to collapse right around the time half the world decides to go to war.  Many places in the US will have no access to resources like fuel, food, medication, then necessities such as water( or pleasantries like electricity and internet ).  People will be rounded up and sent to these camps in the guise of protection, but they will never be allowed to leave.  Anyone who opposes will be dealt with accordingly.  People will be forced to work in these camps in order to pay their stay, much like what happens in prisons. 

Is this the only possibility?  Of course not.  We could also be on the brink of an ice age following one of the hottest summers on record( I read something the other day that mentioned by 2015 there will be places too hot to live on earth ).  

So why am I afraid for the first time in a long time( that same fear I felt the first time I started studying the Kennedy assassination for finding out there was so much that's hidden )?  I've always said that I would be willing to fight back, that I would never give up what few guns I have, that I would be more willing to go live in the forest than ever go stay in a camp or work as a slave.  While watching the cabin shootout with Dorner, it really scared me.  There was a small army of police officers firing a non stop wall of bullets towards that cabin, right before they burned it down.  No man could live through that, at least not by himself.  I've always been good at placing myself in someone else's shoes, being able to see and experience what they see.  So I did that with Dorner.  What if I was Dorner, I was innocent - hadn't murdered anyone( regardless of what actually happened ), and I was just running for my life?  It's terrifying.

I don't think anything will change due to politics at this point.  ""Peaceful revolution"" is no longer possible. Our voices are shut out before anyone can listen, and anyone who disagrees with the public narrative is crazy.  Think you deserve internet privacy?  You must be a terrorist.  Want to keep your guns?  You must want to shoot up a school or movie theater.  You don't want drones with killing power flying over your house?  Only enemies of the US need to be afraid of those.  Don't want fluoride in your water or pesticides on your genetically modified crops?  Obviously you're schizophrenic.  

So should I be afraid/worried?  If yes or no, why?",conspiracy,climate change

207,"Access Graphics (run by John Ramsey, the father of JonBenet Ramsey) as a CIA front",168.0,e4kah5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e4kah5/access_graphics_run_by_john_ramsey_the_father_of/,20.0,1575220741.0,"Many people here are familiar with the death of JonBenet Ramsey. JonBenet was the 6-year-old daughter of a wealthy family in Boulder CO, and was found dead in her family's basement on December 26, 1996. There have been many treatments of the case, with people tending to say either the one of the Ramseys did it (RDI) or an intruder did it (IDI). I personally believe that both sides are only partial truths, and that JonBenet was a victim of a pedophile ring that her family pushed her into, which led to her death. There is a lot of evidence for this, discussed on [this wiki page](http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=JonBenet_Ramsey_murder) and also [this forum post](http://rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?p=656234#p656234). Now if we are to accept that JonBenet was being prostituted out by her parents, that raises the question of what her parents' backgrounds were. This type of abuse associated with elite pedophile rings tends to be intergenerational and linked to military/intelligence entities. Both of her parents, John Ramsey and Patsy Ramsey, happen to have those connections in their background, but for this post I'll be focusing on John.

John was born in Lincoln NE but his family soon moved to Michigan, near the state capital Lansing. His father, James Dudley Ramsey a.k.a. Jay Ramsey, headed the Nebraska Aeronautics Commission from 1947 to 1956 and then led the Michigan Aeronautics Commission from 1957 to 1979. Near the end of his tenure as the MAC director, a group of wealthy Michigan pedophiles led by Francis Shelden constructed an airstrip on North Fox Island to enable them to fly children (and, most likely, other wealthy pedophiles) onto the island. It is not known for certain whether Jay Ramsey was aware of this, but he had a reputation for running Michigan's airports with such a heavy hand that he earned the nickname ""Czar Ramsey"". The North Fox Island pedophile ring was linked to the 1976-77 Oakland County Child Killer (OCCK) murders, and the family of a suspect in the OCCK murders, Stephen Stanislaw, is also believed to have intersected with the Ramsey family through Michigan aeronautics circles.

From 1961-66, John attended Michigan State University studying electrical engineering. He went into the US Navy right after graduating, beginning with Officer Candidate School in Newport RI and then the civil engineer corps school at Port Hueneme CA. (Curious note: There is a woman named Nancy Krebs who claims that she was abused from a young age by the Whites, the family of John Ramsey's future best friend Fleet White. She also claims that John was part of this abuse, despite it predating John and Fleet's official first meeting in Boulder. However, Nancy's lawyer Lee Hill spoke to reporters and found ""entries made, visitors and gift senders to a birth"" indicating that John and Fleet knew each other earlier than they claimed. And it actually turns out that John's temporary stationing in California matches up with when Nancy was at the age she claims John abused her. This would, of course, suggest that John was part of a pedophile network from a very young age, which could make sense given his father's background.) Starting around 1967, John spent 3 years at Subic Bay in the Philippines, where he held a top secretary security clearance and also visited ""Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand"" for ""R&R"". John subsequently left active duty and stayed in the Naval reserves for 8 more years. He went through a series of technology jobs, settling in Atlanta around 1975.

In 1983, John started a computer equipment distribution company (supposedly out of his basement in Atlanta) called Teqspec Distribution Company, Inc. Within the next year, he hooked up with local businessmen J. Thomas Woolsey and Robert A. Dinning, changing its name to MicroSouth Inc. Apparently simultaneously, John had a business called Teqspec II, Inc., which was renamed in 1985 to ElectroSouth, Inc. and also included Woolsey and Dinning on the board. In 1985 as well, John's father-in-law Donald Paugh (who worked for likely CIA front Union Carbide and almost certainly abused his daughter Patsy) appears to have started a company called Advanced Products Group, Inc. In 1988, ElectroSouth and Advanced Products Group merged. The next year, APG merged with CAD Distributors of Boulder CO and CADSources Inc. of Piscataway NJ to form Access Graphics, headquartered in Boulder. John Ramsey maintained high-level positions at Access, eventually becoming president. In 1991, Lockheed Corporation purchased Access Graphics, and John relocated the family to Boulder.

Lockheed Corporation, of course, would end up merging with Martin Marietta in 1993 to become Lockheed Martin, one of the nation's largest defense contractors. The fact that John Ramsey was the president and CEO of a tech company owned by such a major part of our military-industrial complex raised some eyebrows when this case broke. Most notable was [Robert Sterling's 1998 article on this case](http://www.konformist.com/jonbenet.htm), which combined the history of Lockheed Martin's corrupt dealings, other pedophile ring cases like Franklin, and John's military background to suggest that Access was a ""stick in CIA stick and carrot affairs"".

Such an accusation is of course far from proven, but I've come to believe that something about Access Graphics doesn't add up, and that it is indeed likely to be an intelligence front. Like Robert Sterling, I don't have any direct proof, just a lot of tantalizing associations, but I wanted to put it all together to show how well the case stacks up, and also solicit people who might have any additional evidence. The following evidence hints at Access Graphics being a CIA front involved in child pornography, satellite espionage, and/or the PROMIS software development:

* One early story in the tabloids (*The Star*, ""JonBenet Dad Linked to Kiddie Porn Scandal"", 1997/04/29) claimed that child pornography had been found on Access Graphics computers. While anything printed in the tabloids should be taken with a grain of salt, it is worth noting that neither the Ramseys nor Lockheed Martin had any reaction to the story, in spite of the very disturbing allegations made against their company and the fact that the Ramseys would later sue the same tabloid over a Burke-did-it story ([*Boulder Daily Camera*, ""Ramseys sue Star on behalf of son"", 1999/12/01](http://web.dailycamera.com/extra/ramsey/1999/01crams.html)). Robert Sterling, noting the CIA's historical involvement in the tabloid press, wrote ""if anyone has a better explanation than that it was released by the *Star* to discredit the report, I'd like to hear it"". If the report is true, Access Graphics would appear to have some involvement in child pornography.

* As mentioned above, a key witness in the JonBenet case was Nancy Krebs. She claimed abuse at the hands of oilman Fleet White Sr., oilman Fleet White Jr. (John Ramsey's best friend in Boulder, who hosted the Christmas party that the family attended right before JonBenet's death), and ""Uncle Johnny"" who she identified as John Ramsey. Nancy specifically accused John of producing child pornography and setting up various front companies to launder the profits from it:
> D. And in this letter I’m expressing my feelings about how he treated me
> 
> A. Mm-huh
> 
> D. What he did with the money or whatever that was made from umm prostituting me in pornographic films and pictures
> 
> A. Ok
> 
> D. And it’s also saying what little that I know about the involvement that he had with my family and in a business sense
> 
> A Ok, so let’s take the last part first..so you knew John Ramsey and your mother and your father were in some sort of a business agreement
> 
> D No..no I am saying that some of the money that was made on some of the film that they did and prostituting of me and probably countless other people were funneled through business or things that John Ramsey would set up for them

* For a mere reseller of computer equipment that supposedly began as a basement startup, Access Graphics took in a staggering amount of money. By 1996 its revenues had reached $1 billion. For comparison (see the aforementioned wiki page), in that same year, Microsoft's revenues were $8.67 billion and Dell's were at $5.3 billion. There is accordingly a distinct possibility that Access was being used to launder money from other unknown ventures. A little-noted anecdote from John's past shows that he might not be morally restrained from involvement in money laundering ([Steve Thomas, *JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation*, p.86](https://books.google.com/books?id=pC3k1vnwLhEC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22Southern+Peripherals+and+Instruments%22&source=bl&ots=IDUooDO_zE&sig=ACfU3U2PMtb-2pZKif_0xlsHTcBHwtr-Aw&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWiffG8pTmAhVExVkKHWsXB2cQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Southern%20Peripherals%20and%20Instruments%22&f=false)): ""He joined the computer revolution as manager of Southern Peripherals and Instruments in Atlanta. The company didn't do well, and his bosses were unhappy because they said Ramsey tried to expense about $5,000 worth of repair work on his Porsche and personal flying costs."" One [anonymous post](http://solvingjonbenet.blogspot.com/2018/05/back-to-basics.html?showComment=1529521916160#c1837618651145203802) (which I am still working to verify) also says that in spring 1996 Lockheed Martin asked a former Access owner who John had marginalized to return to the company, theorizing it was because General Electric discovered financial irregularities in advance of its purchase of Access the following year.

* There was an interesting article published in 2015, admittedly unverified, making the same observations about Access's implausibly high revenue. From [Voice of Dissent, ""/222/ EXPOSED. WELCOME TO WONDERLAND"", 2015/03](http://thegipster.blogspot.com/2015/07/222-exposed.html):
> Follow the money. Follow the money. Follow the money.
> 
> Access Graphics was a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, and was officially a distributor of mid-level computer hardware and software. You could think of Access Graphics as a VAR (Value Added Reseller) acting as an intermediary between manufacturers and ""resellers"" that sell to end-user businesses. Investigators familiar with classified projects will probably notice the tell tale signs of a company with a black budget. Access Graphics had nearly a half a billion dollars in annual revenue coming in without explanation or balance sheet entries that tied this revenue to it's main line of work.
> 
> Keep in mind that Lockheed Martin has it's hands in a lot of things and most of them have direct ties to the Department of Defense. This is no secret, but if you dig deep enough, you'll find that Access Graphics' location in Colorado probably wasn't for the scenery or the fresh mountain air. The University of Colorado Boulder is home to the US National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive, the National data node for access to state and national agency data sets, the USGS DRGs Digital Raster Graphics, rumored Area 51 replacement Aurora etc. Lots and lots of high altitude photography and do keep in mind that in the early 90's the United States was still cleaning up the mess Saddam had made during his retreat in the Gulf War (Operation Desert Shield.) Combinations of high altitude and thermal imagery were being deployed to help locate burning oil wells out in the middle of the Kuwaiti desert.
> 
> The rumor is Access Graphics was working with the Department of Defense, Lockheed, Unisys (possibly others) and the University of Colorado Boulder on some highly secretive technology used to process satellite imagery. These days we take technology like a cellular phone that can stitch together a series of pictures and produces one seamless panoramic image for granted. Most of us hardly give thought to the amazing coverage of the Earth we can readily view on Google Earth and Google Maps. Back in the late 80's and early 90's putting together imagery like that was still a time consuming task that required skilled technicians and most of the images were still on photographic paper. The most we can tell you is that we believe Access Graphics was deeply involved in developing software that digitized and stitched together large amounts of satellite imagery; and that this imagery had significant military applications.

* What the above article describes Access as doing with satellite technology is exactly what other Lockheed Martin subsidiaries were doing with the PROMIS software on behalf of the CIA. To give a brief overview, PROMIS was advanced database software which the Justice Department stole and then provided to various domestic (FBI, CIA, NSA, etc.) and foreign (Mossad) intelligence agencies to use for various purposes. PROMIS was often modified with backdoors before being sold to unsuspecting clients, or used as the foundation of a growing surveillance state. According to Mike Ruppert ([""Promis"", 2000](http://www.fromthewilderness.net/free/pandora/052401_promis.html)), the CIA through Lockheed was developing PROMIS to keep track of natural resources spotted through satellite imagery:
> In the meantime, after winning some successes, including a resounding Congressional finding that he had been cheated, Bill Hamilton hit his own buzz saw in a series of moves by the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments and rigged court decisions intended to bankrupt him and force him out of business. He survived and fought on. In the meantime hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and sales fees were going into the wrong pockets. And, as was later revealed from a number of directions, this initial tampering with the software was far from the only game in town. Both the CIA, through GE Aerospace in Herndon Virginia (GAO Contract #82F624620), the FBI and elements of the NSA were tinkering with Promis, not just to modify it with a trap door, but to enhance it with artificial intelligence or AI. It's worth it to note that GE Aerospace was subsequently purchased by Martin-Marietta which then merged to become Lockheed-Martin the largest defense and aerospace contractor in the world. This will become important later on.
> 
> [...]
> 
> I was not surprised when Bill Hamilton confirmed to both Fitts and to me that WinokurÕs DynCorp had played a role in the evolution of Promis in the 1980s. One other surprise was to come out of FittsÕ investigations that had months earlier led her to conclude that she was up against Promis-related interests. On the very day that DoJ and HUD shut her down she was discussing software development with a Canadian firm that is at the heart of the Canadian space program, Geomatics. The term Geomatics applies to a related group of sciences - all involving satellite imagery - used to develop geographic information systems, global positioning systems and remote sensing from space that can actually determine the locations of natural resources such as oil, precious metals and other commodities.
> 
> [...]
> 
> This situation is custom made for enhanced Promis software with back-door technology. What better way to map and inventory all of the worldÕs resources than by making each client nation pay for the work. By providing the client nation Promis-based software it would then be possible to compile a global data base of every marketable natural resource. And it would not be necessary to even touch the resources because commodities and futures markets exist for all of them. An AI enhanced, Promis-based program would then be the perfect set up to make billions of dollars in profits by watching and manipulating the worldÕs political climate to trade in, letÕs say Tungsten futures. Such a worldwide database would be even more valuable if there were, for example, a sudden surge in the price of gold or platinum.
> 
> Bill Hamilton readily agreed that this was an ideal situation for the application of Promis technology. In furthering our research on Geomatics we discovered that almost everywhere Geomatics technology went we also found Lockheed-Martin.

* Curiously, the acquisition of GE Aerospace by Lockheed Martin ties into the Ramsey case. As a 1997 news article ([*Boulder Daily Camera*, ""Ramsey exit to follow trade of Boulder firm"", 1997/11/04](http://web.dailycamera.com/extra/ramsey/1997/11/04-1.html)) noted, Martin Marietta's 1993 purchase of GE Aerospace gave GE a bunch of shares in Lockheed Martin, and in 1997 Lockheed Martin got those shares back by giving GE several of LM's firms, including Access Graphics. So over the period of a few years, GE Aerospace and Access Graphics -- two companies suspected of involvement in PROMIS -- were basically swapped between General Electric and Lockheed Martin.

* Key people involved in Iran-Contra and the PROMIS scandal have been at least tenuously connected to the Ramseys. Soon after the case became public, the Ramseys hired a prominent Washington DC spin doctor Patrick Korten, whose previous PR clients had included Oliver North and the Justice Department under Edwin Meese. North was deeply involved in Iran-Contra as well as the use of PROMIS to track ""dissidents"" (i.e. US opponents of Reagan Administration foreign policy), and Meese helped facilitate the initial DOJ theft of PROMIS.
Another connection comes through Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), with whom Patsy Ramsey made public appearances after winning Miss West Virginia in 1977 (and perhaps there was a deeper involvement: Patsy's likely abuse by Don Paugh and the observation that her movement was a ""little automaton"" may indicate a mind control background, and Byrd has been accused by Cathy O'Brien of being a programmer in such endeavors). Danny Casolaro, an investigator of the PROMIS scandal, went to West Virginia to pursue leads on the case, including multiple sources in Byrd's office, and wound up dead of a ""suicide"" in a Martinsburg WV hotel with his investigative files stolen.

* [Tom Heneghan claimed in 2006](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/openmindfiles/conversations/topics/9320), albeit without verification, that Access Graphics had a much more direct connection to some of the aforementioned figures: ""Access Graphics major bank accounts were parked at the noted Iran Contra money laundry Silverado Savings and Loan and administered by none other than Neil Bush. Important: Notes taken from John Ramseys offices in Denver Colorado in December 1996 include the phone numbers of Oliver North, Edwin Meese and former U.S. President William Clinton. Sources close to the Denver Police are now finally reporting that this evidence was taken in December 1996 and then classified under a National Security Decree.""

* According to [Washington state corporate filing 0003611803](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JZI3qTH89so4DG-Tr168zLuAXdBBUwv9) for Access Graphics, one of the directors of the company was Peter B. Teets. Teets epitomizes the revolving door between the military-industrial complex and federal government. He had a long career at Martin Marietta / Lockheed Martin (which, notably, began in the Denver area; he was in fact educated at the University of Colorado, Boulder): handling its aerospace programs from the 60s through the 90s, supervising LM subsidiaries like Access Graphics from 1995 to 1996, and finally becoming president and COO from 1997 to his retirement in 1999. In 2001 he was named undersecretary of the Air Force and director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), positions he held until 2005.
It's not surprising to see Teets on the board of Access Graphics given that it was one of the subsidiaries that he managed.

>**2010, August 28** • Google, CIA Invest in 'Future' of Web Monitoring.      
The investment arms of the CIA and Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time – and says it uses that information to predict the future.     
The company is called Recorded Future, and it scours tens of thousands of websites, blogs and Twitter accounts to find the relationships between people, organizations, actions and incidents – both present and still-to-come. In a white paper, the company says its temporal analytics engine ""goes beyond search"" by ""looking at the 'invisible links' between documents that talk about the same, or related, entities and events.""    
The idea is to figure out for each incident who was involved, where it happened and when it might go down. Recorded Future then plots that chatter, showing online ""momentum"" for any given event.    
""The cool thing is, you can actually predict the curve, in many cases,"" says company CEO Christopher Ahlberg, a former Swedish Army Ranger with a PhD in computer science. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2010/07/exclusive-google-cia/)    

That's so amazing isn’t it? You can actually **predict the curve**. Well now, let's think, were have we seen that curve terminology before? Population Curve? Nope, that's not right. Curve Your Enthusiasm? That doesn't sound right either. Right, it's Curb Your Enthusiasm. Duh. The Learning Curve? Ugh. I just can't remember, can you? Oh shoot, that's right, it's the **Title of My Post's, Flatten the Curve**. Ok. Moving on. Let's get back to Recorded Future.    

>Occupy Wall Street Media Monitoring • 
In 2011, Recorded Future reported, ""... gaining online momentum for the Occupy Wall Street movement. When we look more carefully at influencers in this discussion using our Influencer Map, we find that Iran Press TV is the second largest influencer after the U.S. media!"" [Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_Future)      

Recorded Future saw online momentum for the Occupy Wall Street Movement. But. But. Does that mean they knew the social discord was going to lead to today's riots? Could they be manipulating police to follow orders without fear of repercussions for the future? 
Nah. They couldn't have, otherwise police officers wouldn't be going to go jail after violating a citizens rights, right? 

>**2020, June 22** • Police in America’s biggest cities are failing to meet even the most basic international human rights standards governing the use of lethal force, a new study from the University of Chicago has found.    
Researchers in the university’s law school put the lethal use-of-force policies of police in the 20 largest US cities under the microscope. They found not a single police department was operating under guidelines that are compliant with the minimum standards laid out under international human rights laws.   
Among the failings identified by the law scholars, some police forces violate the requirement that lethal force should only be wielded when facing an immediate threat and as a last resort. Some departments allow deadly responses in cases of “escaping suspects”, “fugitives”, or “prevention of crime” – all scenarios that would be deemed to fall well outside the boundaries set by international law.
Top UN human rights expert urges US to listen to demands of protesters.   
In other cities, police guidelines failed to constrain officers to use only as much force as is proportionate to the threat confronting them.   
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/us-police-human-rights-standards-report)   

Hmmm. Maybe the militarization of our police is starting to make a lot more sense now, doesn’t it? It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy to know that pretty soon that same police force will be able to track you anywhere. 


>**May 15, 2012 • CIA Chief: We'll Spy on You Through Your Dishwasher**.      
It's great that you've got so much new household hardware connected to the internet. Especially for the CIA, whose director wants to spy on you through it.      
More and more personal and household devices are connecting to the internet, from your television to your car navigation systems to your light switches. CIA Director David Petraeus cannot wait to spy on you through them. [SOURCE HERE](https://www.wired.com/2012/03/petraeus-tv-remote/)    

What's David Petraeus talking about? The Internet of Things. That same Internet of Things that 5G is being rushed out for. That same Internet of Things that will help usher in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. That same 4th Revolution that the World Economic Forum is calling the Great Reset. Perfect Plan. Crisis. Crap your pants. Solution. If you think the Surveillance State is omnipresent now, just wait until the infrastructure is built for the next level of control. For our safety, of course. Keep Calm and Carry On. The Not Normal New Normal is going to be very dangerous. And to save us from the Not Normal New Normal they have to keep us safe from Fake News with Fact Checks. **Wash Your Hands and Wear Your Mask**. Keep your Contact Tracer App Up to Date. Don't gather in large groups, use the internet to keep in touch with friends and loved ones, that way we can data mine those conversations to keep you safe from conspiracy theorists antivax who propagate propoganda. 

>**September 2, 2020** • Although the coronavirus pandemic has altered how people live for some time now, the knowledge that it will have an end is a faint light at the end of a long socially distanced tunnel. But, according to new research, that light may be further than we thought. Infectious disease expert and coronavirus task force voice of reason Anthony Fauci believes we may be entering a “pandemic era.” Because of course we are. [Source Here](https://www.mic.com/p/dr-fauci-said-were-entering-a-pandemic-age-what-does-that-mean-33006509)      

The Pandemic Era. Line up and get shot, errr, sorry, I meant, line up and get your shots. Don't be an antivaxer. **Save Civilization, Get Your Vaccination**. Remember, we won't have a second wave, it will just be one long continuous wave. Wait. Hold up. Nope. That's wrong. We are having a second wave. Surf's up so don't wipe out.     

>His assertion comes from a new report in the scientific journal Cell, whose author David Morens, a medical historian and colleague of Fauci’s at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicts that coronavirus might be only the first of a series of worldwide diseases. These types of diseases have been cropping up more and more frequently, according to research. **The phenomenon is similar to the exponential growth of climate change, meaning if a “pandemic age,” becomes a reality, it joins humanity’s very real race to doomsday**. Neat!     

Ah. The Pandemic Era and Environmental Collapse. Amazing! It's the sequel that we've been waiting for! Mad Max and Pandemic Road.   And who is causing the upcoming doom? Why us, who else. You see, the enemy isn't at the gates, that Trojan Horse was yesterday's news. The Terrorists that were threatening Western Civilization have been beaten back, only to be replaced by an enemy that can't be seen or heard. The Biological Terrorists. And how are we responsible for the Great Bioterror that needs a Great Reset?

>As for the culprit to this acceleration? It’s us, of course. For how humans are causing this acceleration, Fauci and Morens point to deforestation, urban crowding, and wet markets for wild game, which have been wreaking havoc for a century and contribute to environmental degradation around the world.    

Us. It's always us. We don't listen. We just Keep Calm and Carry On. But now we're going to have to listen. We won't have any choice, will we? The environment is collapsing. It's our fault. We own the companies. We package small items in big boxes because, marketing. We dump toxic chemical waste that poison people. We make cellphones that are outdated in one year. We're the one's lying about plastic being recycled. What? You actually thought you were doing your part and saving the environment?   

>**2020, September, 21** • The industry's awareness that recycling wouldn't keep plastic out of landfills and the environment dates to the program's earliest days, [NPR] found. ""There is serious doubt that [recycling plastic] can ever be made viable on an economic basis,"" one industry insider wrote in a 1974 speech.
Yet the industry spent millions telling people to recycle, because, as one former top industry insider told NPR, selling recycling sold plastic, even if it wasn't true.       
Here's the basic problem: All used plastic can be turned into new things, but picking it up, sorting it out and melting it down is expensive. Plastic also degrades each time it is reused, meaning it can't be reused more than once or twice.    
On the other hand, new plastic is cheap. It's made from oil and gas, and it's almost always less expensive and of better quality to just start fresh.    
**As it turns out, less than 10% of plastic has ever been recycled**. 

####Ever.

It's us.. We demand these things. What? Does that shock you? Of course that's why they make our goods disposable, the public demands it. It's not like marketing works and the demand is a manufactured need to increase their profits. Nope. It's us. Our existence is killing the planet. This wouldn't be happening if there weren't so many of us. Because this is obviously the first extinction level event that could be happening because of abrupt climate change.

And didn't I say that it was cyanobacteria because I saw a pond that looked like it was outgassing hydrogen sulfide gas in a video I linked to? Yes, yes I did. And guess what? The Greek was right.   

>More than 300 elephants in Botswana have been killed by toxin-producing cyanobacteria in waterholes, government wildlife officials said Monday. But that explanation doesn't satisfy some conservationists.   
The deaths, which took place over the course of three months, were first recorded in May and reported in early July. Their cause was initially a mystery; Botswana ordered laboratory tests to be carried out on carcass, soil and water samples as speculation grew over the deaths.
Cyanobacteria are routinely found in water, but not all produce toxins. **Scientists worry that climate change will trigger the bacteria to produce more toxins** as water temperatures rise and conditions become more favorable for the bacteria to grow. [Source Here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/21/africa/botswana-elephant-deaths-intl/index.html)   

That doesn't satisfy some conservationists? Really? Worldwide reports of a rotten egg smell. Dogs dying when they jump into cyanobacteria filled waters. Rivers turning red. Nah. The New Normal is our New Normal, until AI turns it into our New New Normal. 


>**Pax Technica** • What is the internet of things? This pax will not be dominated by any one state, Howard argues, but by “a special kind of stability in global politics, revealing a pact between big technology firms and government”. The categories of democracy and dictatorship will fall. In their place, he claims, will be data-driven socio-technocracies, built on the intensive reporting of our behaviours, habits, tastes and beliefs, seamlessly transmitted by the devices we use, carry and interact with. We won’t need to express our political preferences and needs: our white goods and driverless cars will express them for us. [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/15/internet-of-things-mass-surveillance)    
By tracking us in intensive and intrusive ways – not only in our homes, but in our vehicles and bodies – **data-driven devices can nudge, manipulate and mould our behaviours**, habits and preferences, limit our autonomy, and bring quantification, segregation and discrimination to what is currently a political economy held together by social fuzziness.       

They'll be able to shape and modify our behavior. And when you put Recorded Future and other companies into the mix, guess what happens? They'll shape and modify our behaviours before they become our behaviours, because they'll already know how we'll behave in the future. Kind of like the shaming of antivaxer behavior before they announce:

Or priming us for AI to save the environment:   

>According to a recent survey by Intel and the research firm Concentrix, 74 percent of business-decision makers working in environmental sustainability agree **artificial intelligence (AI) will help solve long-standing environmental challenges; 64 percent agree the Internet of Things (IoT) will help solve these challenges**.      
As the field of AI develops, so will the potential to protect the environment. From the land and air to both drinking and ocean water, AI is shaping up to be the key that governments, organizations, and individuals can tap to work toward a cleaner planet. [Source Here](https://www.recode.net/ad/18027288/ai-sustainability-environment)     

Do you see where all this is going? The AI and IoT will be everywhere. It will save us from the Collapse, which really means, it will save us from ourselves. Do you see the convergence that's taking place? No? Let me remind you. Because if we are the problem, then we aren't alone. 

>Coronavirus which is killing and infecting people all over the world was created in a Lab in China's Wuhan, such an idea would have been labelled a conspiracy theory until a few weeks ago.     
But earlier this week, a Chinese virologist Dr Li-Meng Yan, in an exclusive conversation with WION claimed that the deadly coronavirus was developed in a government laboratory in Wuhan. She also said that Chinese government was aware of the COVID-19 spread.    
And now Professor Giuseppe Tritto, an internationally known expert in biotechnology and nanotechnology in his book 'China COVID 19: The chimera that changed the world' has said that he believes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is behind the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), leaving little doubt that this viral “chimera” was artificially created as a bioweapon.

We're going to war against China, while they get the security apparatus up for AI in the war against our minds and individuality. For an environmental collapse they blame us for. And they will focus our shame into anger towards  China.      

The system will be set up. We will go to war with China. And the system will be fully executed by the time the war is done. It will have to be, for our safety, of course. And AI will keep us safe. Right? **RIGHT!** Wait. So then why are all the elite building Doomsday Bunkers? Almost like the 1% are covering their bases in case AI can't save us.   

>One of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality. Being denied what you have seen. Being denied what you have experienced and know to be true. It can make you feel like you are crazy. But you are not crazy.   
Dr Robin Stern, associate director at Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of The Gaslight Effect says that usually “when people are abused there are signs that you can point to that are much more obvious. Someone who has been hit or threatened for instance – it’s easy to see and understand how they have been hurt. **But when someone is manipulating you, you end up second-guessing yourself and turning your attention to yourself as the person to blame**”. [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/16/gaslighting-manipulation-reality-coping-mechanisms-trump)    


DARVO - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Or, Gaslighting. It's a popular term. It's a great way to make us feel like powerless victims. Gaslighting makes us feel like we need to be saved. When you're searching for answers but only end up finding confusion, it's setting you up to accept any New Normal answer they'll eventually give you. Need someone to blame for the state of chaos? Here's China. They're the problem. **We're All In This Together, and You're Either With Us Or Against Us**. And there will be people against the war, and therefore against us, so we'll need surveillance to protect us from the enemies within. Because another War will be a necessary evil. World War Three will be the War to save the planet by destroying the planet. Makes sense, doesn't it? And when our planet is worse off than before? Then we'll need the surveillance to help us decide when to have Climate and Pandemic lockdowns. The omnipresent Eye of AI will guide us and safeguard us against Fake News and Not Normal New Normal Narrative disrupting lies. We will have to kill what's left of our privacy because dangerous thoughts are born in secrecy. 

We must become a transparent society, because the truth doesn't need to hide. The truth is universal. But who decides what is true? Not us. We can't be trusted. Look what we already did with our privacy, we destroyed our planet. So we have to become dependent upon the system and trust the choices that the system makes. We can't just follow system orders though, we have to become a part of the system, a unified whole working towards the common good of all mankind. But what happens when you question the choices? What happens if your thoughts and actions disrupt the Not Normal New Normal Narrative?   

Let's check back with David Petraeus a year later after openly musing about how the IoT will make surveillance ubiquitous in our society. 

>**2012, November 9 • Petraeus Resigns From CIA After Feds Uncover 'Extramarital Affair'** [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/petraeus-down/)

Oops. I think David said something that he shouldn't have said about IoT and Surveillance. It's a quick fall from Superhero To Villan when you reveal the Superhero Clubhouse Secrets.    


Look. Listen. Think. Question. All the time. The information is out there. So's the truth, even if it's camouflaged. Because the truth is, the big picture is a lot more complicated than thought reducing and behavioral shaping memes. Life isn't black and white. That's why they call it a Grey War. And the Grey War is happening all around us. And in the coming weeks I'll be posting some eye opening stories about the Dark Web, Blockchain, and the current narrative about inequality. About a certain pharmaceutical company and how it's DNA  tests are failing the grade. We will dive into the Uighur Minority in China. And most importantly, Cicada 3301, and how it seems to be playing a larger role than most of us realize. And some updates on the current microbial imbalance that is starting to cause havoc on our planets environment. And as if that isn't enough for eye opening revelations, there is a disturbing trend that I've noticed regarding asteroids and impacts. Because why not, after all, 2020 isn't a real party until a Rockstar crashes the party. 

I may have been too tired to post lately, but I wasn't too tired to read. Thanks again for all the comments and PM's checking in on me. It meant the world to me, even if I didn't have time to respond.

The only thing they did not prepare, however, was the vaccine or a treatment for the virus that would cause a pandemic, though she acknowledged how ""lucky""  she and her family are to be in a position of privilege when it comes to dealing with COVID-19. 
""**What we mostly talk about now in our home every night is how lucky we are,"" she continued. ""We understand our privilege.

Yep. Sure thing Melinda. You guys just sit around the dinner table (like us normal plebs) and talk about how lucky you are to have food. Then you went out and stocked up your basement. Maybe they hoarded all the toilet paper because they're so full of crap they can use TP to wipe their mouths with after they speak. And what a minute, isn’t hoarding food bad? And aren't billionaires just hoarding cash? Different rules for different people, and it makes no difference what they say publicly when it's still just the same crap.

So which basements were you stocking Bill? I'm betting you stocked all of them. But that article really made it sound like you personally went grocery shopping, didn't it?   

And there's that year again, 2015. The same year as the Bird Man plauge doctor video, coronavirus and bats possible pandemic discovered, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing went mainstream, and the Billy Boy pandemic warnings started with a Ted Talk, then the Doomsday Bunkers elite MKultra wealthy segment jumped by 700%.    

That's not a good sign.    

It's all connected. All of it. We might not know how. Or who's doing what. Or how bad our current ELE events will become, but we need to at least get an outline of the big picture, before the big picture turns into the Main Event.   

As far as I'm concerned, there is no possible way our present unexplained mysteries aren't prognosticators of upcoming calamities. 

No. Way. At. All.    

Let's throw the spotlight back onto our pandemic. It's all plain and simple when you accept the government's and the medical community's word at Face(book) value. Our leaders tell us to Keep Calm and Carry On. Just take two official narrative pills and wait for the vaccine. It's all good. Honestly. Listen. Trust. Obey. 

>**1913 to 1951**: Dr. Leo Stanley, chief surgeon at the San Quentin Prison, performed a wide variety of experiments on hundreds of prisoners at San Quentin. Many of the experiments involved testicular implants, where Stanley would take the testicles out of executed prisoners and surgically implant them into living prisoners. In other experiments, he attempted to implant the testicles of rams, goats, and boars into living prisoners. Stanley also performed various eugenics experiments, and forced sterilizations on San Quentin prisoners.[13] Stanley believed that his experiments would rejuvenate old men, control crime (which he believed had biological causes), and prevent the ""unfit"" from reproducing.     

Whelp, at least you could say that Dr. Stanley had the balls to carry out his experiments.   

Tuberculosis. Syphilis. Herpes. Influenza. Malaria. The medical society treated us to a rolodex of experiments.

>>It may save you much trouble if you publish your paper... elsewhere than in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. The Journal is under constant scrutiny by the anti-vivisectionists who would not hesitate to play up the fact that you used for your tests human beings of a state institution.

Wholy justified. Goes without saying. But we would never be so reckless with experiments today, no matter how justified, would we?

>On January 13, **less than a week** after COVID-19 was identified as the virus behind the outbreak in Wuhan, researchers at Cambridge-based biotech company Moderna proposed a vaccine to fight it. A little over two months later, on Monday morning, a pharmacist in Seattle injected Rebecca Sirull with that vaccine, making her the third person to be injected in a 45-person clinical trial, the first human trial in the country. To rush the vaccine to clinical trial, **Moderna skipped animal testing**, a somewhat extraordinary measure.

Yessiree ladies and gentlemen, step right up, roll up that sleeve, and get a poke to save all the good folks out there from the pandemic. The one that contaminates surfaces, but now doesn't spread through surfaces. The virus that you don’t need a mask for because a mask will make it worse. The virus you might need a mask for because it wouldn't hurt, but it's not airborne. Put on a darn mask because the virus is airborne. Maybe. But air-conditioning makes COVID-19 worse. So only wear a mask inside. The virus that worsens with pollution, but don't worry about putting on the mask outside. Because if you wear a mask you'll stop the second wave. But there might not be a second wave, it might just be one long [continuous wave.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN24T16U&ved=2ahUKEwio4qqdg_7qAhUKj3IEHVydC_YQFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1-S4fg6LFAe49p609NFUif&ampcf=1)    

Is anyone else getting the impression that they don't have enough information about the virus to be issuing guidelines yet? 

But I'm just being paranoid. I'm sure of it. That was then, and this is now.    

>**Then**: In a 1946 to 1948 study in Guatemala, U.S. researchers used prostitutes to infect prison inmates, insane asylum patients, and Guatemalan soldiers with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases in order to test the effectiveness of penicillin in treating the STDs. They later tried infecting people with ""direct inoculations made from syphilis bacteria poured into the men's penises and on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded . . . or in a few cases through spinal punctures"". Approximately 700 people were infected as part of the study (including orphan children). The study was sponsored by the Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health, the Pan American Health Sanitary Bureau (**now the World Health Organization's Pan American Health Organization**) and the Guatemalan government. The team was led by John Charles Cutler, who later participated in the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. Cutler chose to do the study in Guatemala because he would not have been permitted to do it in the United States. In 2010 when the research was revealed, the U.S. officially apologized to Guatemala for the studies. A lawsuit has been launched against **Johns Hopkins University, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Rockefeller Foundation** for alleged involvement [in the study.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)      


That is so reassuring as we move forward, isn’t it? And don't give me any that was back then we've changed arguments. We haven't changed at all. Proof? Ok. Let's go.

 to an LA Times article that talks about Bill Gates and his AIDS fight in Africa. You go Bill. Get them vaccines out to the people. You're such a good guy! That's what a New Normal article would say. This isn’t a New Normal article. It's scathing in it's judgment. They may not be dying of AIDS, or just living longer with AIDS, but they are dying due to other factors, which should be easily acquirable with the wealth at Bill's disposal to prevent.   

But there was one item that caught my eye. It talked about a Paper Mill that was in a country in Africa, that Bill owned a substantial amount of stock in. This company owned paper mills in North America. Those paper mills were environmentally friendly with little emissions. But not the one in the African Country. Nope. Not at all. That one didn't bother with environmentally friendly processes. 

The story goes on to discuss how one of Bill's AIDS treatment recipients lived downwind from this plant and how the fumes we're probably killing him. And what were the fumes?   

Hydrogen Sulfide. (Read more at Flatten the Curve) - [Part 13](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gztcvg/flatten_the_curve_part_13_the_epidemic_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)    

Yes seriously. Treating them for AIDS while downwind from Hydrogen Sulfide. I'm not sure about you, but that sounds like a medical experiment to me. Seriously, the guy that wants to stop climate-change by geo-engineering the planet doesn't use his clout to stop the pollution from a paper plant that he owns stock in. OK. Makes perfect sense, doesn't it? 

Yet actually it might. No, seriously, it really might. I've already stated that the virus seems to be activated with environmental toxins. And here we have an ultimate real life laboratory. And what does this real life laboratory research?   

Why maybe it researchers Miasma theory? Huh? Yep. Here we go.      


>**The miasma theory** is an obsolete medical theory that held that diseases—such as cholera, chlamydia, or the Black Death—were caused by a miasma, a noxious form of ""bad air"", also known as night air. The theory held that epidemics were caused by miasma, emanating from rotting [organic matter.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory&ved=2ahUKEwico83Hmv7qAhWSlXIEHdnkDVUQmhMwDXoECAQQAg&usg=AOvVaw08mVMBVxX71byX7AAb8s7N)     


Rotting organic matter, like at meat plants? 

**May 7, 2020**: www.wired.com | **Why Meatpacking Plants Have Become Covid-19 Hot Spots**.     

**June 23, 2020**: https://www.bbc.com | Coronavirus: Why have there been so many outbreaks in meat processing plants?    

And do you know what else was associated with Miasma Theory? The Bird Man plauge doctor, just like the 2015 ""you're all dead"" [video.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hh03b8/flatten_the_curve_part_26_2015_was_a_busy_year/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)     

The word miasma comes from ancient Greek and means ""pollution"". And then we have Covid-19 and [pollution.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://theconversation.com/amp/air-pollution-exposure-linked-to-higher-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-new-study-141620&ved=2ahUKEwiy_ev7nP7qAhXVYDUKHRgIA_YQFjAAegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw3Qv6YmfJqBnjQu0KHP0_XJ&ampcf=1)       

The idea also gave rise to the name malaria (literally ""bad air"") through medieval Italian. 

Malaria? What? Crazy? Aren't there debunked studies about Malaria drugs working on COVID-19? Nah. Must be fake news. Right? Or fake facts. Or is it fake news reporting fake facts? I'm just so confused.   

Does the strangeness end there? Sadly, it doesn't folks. Not at all. Not in this New Normal.   

Because Mr. Bill Gates is trying to eradicate tuberculosis.    

And, Hydrogen sulfide stimulates Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiration, [growth](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-14132-y&ved=2ahUKEwiot53Ckf7qAhWbmHIEHRQUCcgQFjAIegQIChAB&usg=AOvVaw3VBLfvgC3Ee6TTDVCi1505)   

Back when I looked for information about the pandemic, I noticed something odd, the mortality rate for Covid-19 fluctuated depending on the region. Now I'm not a doctor, but you don’t have to be to read, do you? So I kept looking at the data for similarities. And they were there. Hypoxic or polluted water like lakes or coastlines. Cities with factory polluting emissions. They all led to outbrakes and higher mortality rates.     

And then it changed. I saw ourbreak regions with low mortality rates. It didn't make sense, but there had to be a reason. There's always a reason. And as I kept looking at the similarities of low mortality rates something jumped out, a lot of them were still vaccinated for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.    

Yep. 

But this is crazy talk Greek! You're just looking for dots and finding a way to connect them. It's just a coincidence that Bill Gates is funding AIDS prevention, an article exists that points out a therapy participant is close to a source of hydrogen sulfide emissions from a company that Billy has stock investments in, and that Billy also has a program to eradicate tuberculosis. Stop seeing patterns where they don't exist. You're freaking people out.     

Crap. Perhaps you're right. Maybe I am freaking people out. But let me show you something else. It's something that I noticed about a month after this pandemic was shutting us down. And it didn't make any sense to me at the time. Ready?

And then the studies started backing it up. Even better/worse, they linked it to Hydrogen Sulfide, endogenous not exogenous, but Hydrogen Sulfide is the same no matter if you breathe it in or produce it biologically. 

 So, yeah. Let's dig.        
 
>Endogenous Hydrogen Sulfide stimulates Mycobacterium Tuberculosis respiration, growth, and pathogenesis.    
>>**In mammals, H2S elicits a biphasic, concentration-dependent mitochondrial response14, which can be cytotoxic or cytoprotective. For example, at high concentrations H2S reversibly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV)15–17. In contrast, at low concentrations H2S can serve as bioenergetic fuel to stimulate mitochondrial respiration without uncoupling of respiration**. [Link here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6987094/)       


At high concentrations Hydrogen Sulfide can be cytotoxic and reversibly inhibit cytochrome c oxidase. We've followed the White Rabbit and now we're digging. Can't stop now. Won't stop now.      


>**Defects involving genetic mutations altering cytochrome c oxidase (COX) functionality or structure can result in severe, often fatal metabolic disorders**.      
>>Disorders involving dysfunctional COX assembly via gene mutations include Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy, leukodystrophy, 
anemia, and sensorineural deafness**.[Link here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase)     


Anemia? Like, the Momento movie? Do I have amnesia now and I have to live my life backwards? 

Hold on, don't freak out. You don't have amnesia. Self inflicted amnesia induced systemically via behaviorally manipulated echo chambers introduced systemically through social media electronic pathways? Possibly. But this is anemia, and that's another story.   



>**Current management of COVID-19** is based on the premise that respiratory failure is the leading cause of fatalities (Zhou et al., 2020). Nevertheless, mounting evidence points to drastic systemic events taking place that contribute to accelerated COVID-19 pathogenesis. The “cytokine storm” is a notion that is reportedly hailed as the hallmark of the **COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory state** (Mehta et al., 2020). Consecutive studies linked COVID-19 related hyper-inflammation to systemic events including hypercoagulability, oxidative stress and **altered iron metabolism**. [Mehta et al., 2020, Phua et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264936/)      

**Hyper**inflammatory and altered iron metabolism. Following? Good. 

>**Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)** has been regarded as an infective-inflammatory disease, which affects mainly lungs. More recently, a multi-organ involvement has been highlighted, with different pathways of injury. A **hemoglobinopathy, hypoxia and cell iron overload** might have a possible additional role. Scientific literature has pointed out two potential pathophysiological mechanisms: i) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV- 2) interaction with hemoglobin molecule, through CD147, CD26 and other receptors located on erythrocyte and/or blood cell precursors; ii) hepcidin-mimetic action of a viral spike protein, inducing ferroportin blockage.

Hypoxia? Where have I heard that before?   

>A dangerous symptom of the coronavirus that can cause a patient to fall unconscious or even die is known as hypoxia — when the body’s tissues do not receive enough oxygen. 
Dr. Richard Levitan, an emergency doctor working in New York City, wrote for the New York Times at the end of April that he has seen COVID-19 patients with “alarmingly low” oxygen levels, but no shortness of breath. He describes this as “silent hypoxia”. 
These patients had oxygen saturation levels as low as 50 per cent when normal levels are usually at 94 to 100 per cent at sea level, Levitan explained. 
These patients had oxygen saturation levels as low as 50 per cent when normal levels are usually at [94 to 100 per cent at sea level, Levitan explained.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6930367/silent-hypoxia-coronavirus/amp/&ved=2ahUKEwjR8ODn0qLqAhU6lnIEHY0vDjIQFjADegQIChAB&usg=AOvVaw0pIk7I9QMuTZDkZotdWvbY&ampcf=1)

**https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov** | Hydrogen sulfide stimulates Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiration + growth.          

>Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for millions of deaths each year and several billion people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb modulates host factors, such as endogenous gaseous signalling molecules, to persist in humans for decades. H2S has diverse biological functions, including modulation of immunity and cellular respiration. However, the role of H2S in TB is unclear. We found that mice deficient in H2S production are more resistant to Mtb infection than WT mice. Upon infection, Mtb increases host H2S, which suppresses central carbon metabolism and increases inflammation. Distribution of H2S-producing enzymes in human TB lungs showed that H2S is produced at the site of infection. These findings identify glycolysis and H2S-producing enzymes as targets for TB host-directed therapies.      


Don't Freak Out like LeChic, but I don't think we're in Kansas anymore Dorothy.     

Speaking of Kansas, do you remember the dust storm as the tornado blew in and swept Dorthy to Oz?    


**The “Godzilla” Saharan dust cloud over the US, explained**: 
>Dust clouds originate in the Sahara, the largest desert in the world outside the poles, and the Sahel, just south of the Sahara.
Much of the dust originates in the Bodélé Depression in Chad, an ancient dry lake bed at the threshold of the Sahara and the Sahel. There, convective storms in the early summer whip the dry ground and loft particles of silica, iron, and phosphorous as high as 20,000 feet into the sky. [Link Here](https://www.vox.com/platform/2020/7/1/21307053/sahara-dust-storm-2020-godzilla-cloud-saharan-sunset)       


And then we have this:    

>Residents wear face masks to protect themselves from the Saharan dust clouds covering Dakar, Senegal. N95 masks and even surgical masks can help protect people from getting sick from the dust.
Breathing dust can trigger problems like asthma attacks and worsen conditions like heart disease. But particles from natural sources can pose some unique threats. “Desert soil can also be contaminated with bacteria and fungal spores or with toxic heavy metal,” Achakulwisut said. “For example, in the US Southwest, dust episodes there have been linked to outbreaks of Valley Fever and arsenic poisoning.” [Link Here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vox.com/platform/2020/7/1/21307053/sahara-dust-storm-2020-godzilla-cloud-saharan-sunset&ved=0ahUKEwiU0JbQ3__qAhU4mnIEHcfgDU8QyM8BCDYwAg&usg=AOvVaw1vqPlAPRZwUYtYj4LUc_k0&ampcf=1)     

Contaminated with bacteria. Guaranteed Anaerobic bacteria. And it carries along metallic compounds. Like this:    

>**A 2001 study in Limnology and Oceanography suggested that the seasonal windfalls of iron-rich Saharan dust become a banquet for red tides, blooms of algae that spill into the ocean like dye, deplete it of oxygen, and release toxins. Dust clouds can also host unwelcome stowaways. [Jun 24, 2020 Link Here.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/06/saharan-dust-storms-giving-earth-life/613441/)    

Red tides. Blooms of algae. Or rather perhaps, Cyanobacteria blooms? All in a dust storm. Maybe we should start wearing masks, right? Don't want to breathe in toxic dust, do we?   


>But Snake Park is no paradise. For decades the residents have lived with the mine, which they say blows clouds of dust into their homes. Now Snake Park, formally known as Doornkop, is in the sub-district with the highest number of Covid-19 infections in Gauteng.
Last week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura **linked “cluster outbreaks” on mines, and people moving between them and where they live, to the Covid-19 infections in the western part of Soweto**.       
In 2017, the Bench Marks Foundation, a nonprofit that monitors multinational corporations, released the results of a survey of household health in four mine-affected areas in Soweto. Mine tailings contain heavy metals and chemicals and cause various illnesses, including mental health issues and Down’s Syndrome. The report found that more than two thirds of the respondents in Snake Park complained about **respiratory problems, including persistent coughs, sinus issues, asthma and tuberculosis**. 
This year, the August dust storms in Snake Park will **coincide with the expected peak of Covid-19 infections** in Gauteng.      

>>“We can’t breathe well. This mine is very dangerous. It’s toxic,” Phongoma says, adjusting his bright blue mask. 
Looking at the mine dump, now glistening in the afternoon sun, he adds: “It’s a bomb. It’s a nuclear weapon — and with this Covid-19 thing, it’s going to explode.” [Link Here](https://www.google.com/s/mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-07-09-toxic-dust-from-an-abandoned-mine-coupled-with-covid-19-is-a-tinderbox)

So where are we now? Knowwhere or nowhere? Are you a nobody or a knowbody? Is this picture that I'm painting connecting enough dots for everyone? Does anticipating mass riots in protest of the upcoming environmental collapse, and the wars for natural resources along with it, make the centralization of the economy plus the mass surveillance system make more sense? The masks and facial detection AI improvements?   Does ID2020, another Billy Boy project make more sense? The upcoming robotic automation of the workforce? The curtailing of civil rights? Heck, what about the Bill Gates endorsement of impossible meats and the sudden push to vegetarianism? Remember the meat plant shutdowns? Rotting organic matter and Hydrogen Sulfide?       

Please remember, Hydrogen Sulfide outgassing is pretty consistent across past Extinction Level Events. Does this mean that all hope is lost? Puhlease. Hope flows abundant. We shut Pandora's Box before hope could escape, remember?    

Let me leave you with one final thought. Words matter. Look them up. They know what's happening. They know all of this. The words they use hide it in plain sight.   

I've written about Bill's fortuitous investment strategy. How he seemed to hit all the right stocks as the pandemic and environmental collapse strikes. It's mostly hidden in shell companies after shell companies, but it has to start somewhere. And it does.

And what does Cascade mean? Let's look?    

cascade (n.)

>""a fall or flow of water over a cliff, a waterfall,"" 1640s, from French cascade (17c.), from Italian cascata ""waterfall,"" from cascare ""to fall,"" from Vulgar Latin *casicare, frequentative of Latin casum, casus, past participle of cadere ""**to fall**"" (from PIE root *kad- ""to fall"").    
**cascade **(n.)       
a succession of stages or operations or processes or units;           

To prepare. To fall. Interesting choice for a name.      


>Meteor showers occur when the earth bowls through a dense stream of debris left in the wake of a comet, asteroid, or other space-borne object.
Depending on where you look, you may encounter fewer meteors, however. Viewers in the Northern Hemisphere will see shooting stars emanate from the shower’s “radiant” point in the southern sky, meaning the best meteors with the longest tails will be most readily visible in the east and west.
A much more spectacular meteor shower — among the year’s most prolific — will pepper the skies with a spattering of bright shooting stars and “fireballs” come mid-August. The Perseid meteor shower peaks the night of Tuesday, Aug. 11. Dozens of shooting stars could be visible beneath a clear sky every hour.
Perseid meteors zip across the sky at 37 miles per second. Their diaphanous tails can appear white, orange, yellow, pink, turquoise and even violet, lingering in the sky for a few seconds.

So why is this happening, and why is it getting worse?        

**Get Ready to Bounce**.      
>The earth comprises the crust, which is brittle, and the mantle, which is very thick. In between the mantle and the crust is a thin layer of about 80-200km called the asthenosphere, and it is quite plastic. So if you push down a rubber duck in water, it will sink. If you remove the force, it will bounce back. The crust does the same thing.
In Iceland, you have a big ice-cap in the east. As the ice melts, the crust is bouncing back up. It then releases the pressure on the asthenosphere, which reduces the melting point of the mantle and so [more magma is generated.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/681239/global-warming-wont-just-change-the-weather-it-could-trigger-massive-earthquakes-and-volcanoes/amp/)       


Our crust is moving and generating magma because of the melting ice caps due to climate change. Got it? Get it? Good.      


>They found that between 48 million and about 12 million years ago, the Earth’s spin axis, and therefore its geographic north and south poles, were in a different place than they are today. Long ago, the North Pole would have been closer to Greenland than it is now, and the South Pole would have shifted similarly to the west. Somewhere around 12 million years ago, the poles moved to where they are now.
This shift could have had serious effects on the Earth’s climate, which is particularly interesting given that the last ice age started somewhere around 3.2 million years ago. The change would’ve shifted Greenland up into the Arctic circle, which could have affected ice accumulation at that time. Though more research is needed to sort out the mechanisms of how this would have affected climate change at the time, Gordon, a professor of geophysics, hopes this could add insight to a past climate change in a way that could inform current climate science.
“It’s nice when we can connect global phenomena related to the plates … to the important problem of climate change and also the paleogeographic framework of the world,” [says Gordon.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/millions-of-years-ago-the-poles-moved-and-it-could-have-triggered-an-ice-age&ved=2ahUKEwid74DJhrTqAhUIhOAKHVgPAOA4HhAWMAJ6BAgIEAE&usg=AOvVaw0np0eVQkeu8vXrlYd49nKa)     


The magnetic field is generated by molten magma. Molten magma is fed by subduction into the earth. Subductions cause earthquakes.      


**Shut it Down, This Information is Dangerous**.       
>Research from University of Leeds geophysicist Phil Livermore suggests the pole’s location is controlled by two patches of magnetic field, one beneath northern Canada and another below Siberia. In 2017, he reported the detection of a jet of liquid iron that seemed to be weakening the Canadian patch.
This may be what’s causing the pole to shift so quickly, he said in a presentation at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. He has not yet published that research in a peer-reviewed journal.
By last summer, it became clear that the discrepancy between the World Magnetic Model and the real-time location of the magnetic North Pole was about to exceed the threshold needed for accurate navigation. Researchers for NOAA and the British Geological Survey, who collaborate to produce the model, spent several months analyzing the rapid change. Just before Christmas, the two agencies reached an agreement on a new model and were preparing to publish their updated version.
**And then the government shut down**.
NOAA is responsible for hosting the model and making it available for public use, he said. “All of that is currently unavailable.”
Some have speculated that Earth is overdue for another magnetic field reversal. The geologic record suggests these events happen three times every million years. The last was 780,000 years ago, around the time humans started to evolve. A note to conspiracy theorists: These events are [almost certainly unrelated.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/01/17/north-pole-is-moving-shutdown-means-we-arent-keeping-up/%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwiD78SWiLTqAhWCTt8KHTdtALw4MhAWMAF6BAgJEAE&usg=AOvVaw2jBQ8t8xvBvrYqkQhVPwQP)

Or that there are scientists who drank a cup of Java and claim that the sun and the earth are linked.      


>Thus, the Sun and the corona show long-term variations (here the term ‘long-term’ means time scales longer than two solar cycles). For example, there was no sunspot maximum for nearly 70 years around the late 17th century (Maunder Minimum), but the 11-year cycle restarted and repeated for many centuries.
Such long-term solar variations may affect the Earth through different interplanetary parameters, such as the solar wind, heliospheric magnetic field, solar energetic particles, solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux, and solar radio bursts. In fact, the long-term geomagnetic activities and climate are correlated to the long-term solar variation (e.g., Friis-Christensen and Lassen 1991; Lockwood et al. 1999; Lockwood 2012; Svalgaard and Cliver 2005; Feynman and Ruzmaikin 2011; Stauning 2011; IPCC 2014). Friis-Christensen and Lassen (1991) found that centurial variation of the global temperature shows a similar profile as that of the solar cycle length until the mid 1980s before the anthropogenic effect became the major cause of rapid global warming (Stauning 2011; IPCC 2014). Lockwood (2012) showed that local climate is related to the long-term variation of the solar magnetic activity. Thus, the Sun-Earth coupling varies [over different solar cycles.](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-015-0211-5)

Or the other planet's in our solar system are heating up, just like our earth.             

**2002**.        
>Pluto is undergoing global warming, as evidenced by a three-fold increase in the planet's atmospheric pressure during the past 14 years, a team of astronomers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Williams College, the University of Hawaii, Lowell Observatory and Cornell University announced in a press conference today at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's (AAS) Division for [Planetary Sciences in Birmingham, AL.](http://news.mit.edu/2002/pluto)      


So if the magma is moving underground and causing the pole to shift, wouldn't it stand to reason that the oceans aren't getting hotter because of the atmosphere, but the atmosphere is getting hotter because of the oceans?     


>Undersea gases could superheat the planet.    
Carbon reservoirs on ocean floor caused global warming before -- and could do it again. 
Moreover, the phenomenon is a threat unaccounted for in climate model projections. Undersea carbon dioxide reservoirs are relatively recent discoveries and their characteristics and history are only beginning [to be understood.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190213090812.htm&ved=2ahUKEwjunaa869rqAhWQoHIEHUHBC4k4ChAWMAB6BAgDEAE&usg=AOvVaw3hzWHRBw3h61YFZe91xVNz)    


Oh. So the phenomenon is only recently discovered and hadn't been accounted for. And we have magma moving around as evidenced by the dipole excursion. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that this is what's causing the majority of the increase in atmospheric carbon. 

And where is this dipole headed?     


>Polar express: magnetic north pole speeds towards Russia.     
Surge affects navigation and is believed to be caused by a ‘jet’ stream in Earth’s liquid outer core.       
Something’s up in the Arctic: the north magnetic pole is on the move. But rather than drifting around aimlessly as it has for centuries, the pole has picked up speed and is heading fast for Siberia.      
The pole’s recent travels are believed to be caused by the formation of a narrow stream, much like the jet stream in the atmosphere, in the Earth’s liquid outer core. The iron-nickel core is so hot that it flows like water, 1,869 miles (3,000km) beneath the surface, creating the magnetic field and [dragging it around the planet.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/magnetic-north-pole-moving-pretty-fast-towards-russia)      


The iron nickel core is dragging the magnetic field to Siberia. Which is crazy considering how man made global warming is causing a heat wave in the exact same spot!

>Siberia's Current Heatwave Would Be 'Almost Impossible' if Climate Change Wasn't Real.

**Almost Impossible**.      

What are the odds that we have a liquid molten core and an unrelated man made heat wave all at once? 

It's all linked. All. Of. It. And they don't want you to know. Period. End of story. If you don't think we're going to get hit by this in North America, I don't know what to say. The earthquakes are going to increase. How bad? Lord only knows. The magma is moving and the tectonic plates are moving with it. Want more proof that this is worldwide?         

**April 2018**.           
 >A massive crack suddenly appeared in Kenya, prompting new discussion on the breakup of Africa into two land masses. The leading hypothesis behind the breakup of the African continent is caused by an underlying superheated plume. This plume is causing Africa to split in two along the eastern [edge of the continent.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2018/04/02/an-enormous-crack-just-opened-up-in-africa-evidence-africa-is-literally-splitting-in-two/&ved=2ahUKEwiz8vv0_NrqAhVEj3IEHYgTBR8QFjANegQIDBAz&usg=AOvVaw3gztSY2N7z5spqHioeo3RL&ampcf=1)       
 
  
And lets look at one last part of the picture. The one that I've been harping about, that rotten egg smell and increasing hydrogen sulfide emissions. Africa is being split into two because of a superheated plume. The oceans are full of hydrothermal vent plumes. The oceans are turning hypoxic. Why worry?    


>Deep in the ocean live anaerobic microbes that emit the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct. Lee Kump, head of the Department of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, thinks that, as the low-oxygen waters expanded in the End Permian ocean, these microbes surfaced. The gas they spewed may have poisoned the atmosphere and torn holes in the ozone layer. A die-off that began in the ocean spread to land. Over 90 percent of marine species, including trilobites, went extinct, as did 70 percent of terrestrial species.
Today, there’s one place where scientists can glimpse End Permian–like conditions in the ocean. Off the coast of Namibia in southern Africa, a powerful upwelling occurs that brings those hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria to the surface. From space, the plume is bright green — one likely hue of those sulfidic, End Permian oceans. The coast occasionally stinks of rotten eggs — hydrogen sulfide. Hordes of lobsters sometimes emerge from the sea, [fleeing the toxic waters.](https://psmag.com/news/suffocating-the-ocean)        

Today there's one place that has End Permian like conditions. Just one. We have birds falling from the sky, fish washing up on beaches, and reports all around the world of a [rotten egg smell,](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gztcvg/flatten_the_curve_part_13_the_epidemic_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  and we only have one end like Permian condition on the planet. Really?   

Do you really think they're going to give us the whole picture here? Seriously? If this is happening, and it looks like it is, shouldn't they be devoting non stop news coverage and changing laws, instead of reading the odd article that wonders if we're in an extinction stage event? Or do they know that we can't stop it? Because after the prolonged animal mass mortalities of the End Permian Stage extinction event, which was caused by an increased outgassing of hydrogen sulfide, guess what happened? 

An ice age.    

Is this what they mean by abrupt climate change? It's not just because the planet is getting hotter, but also because we're entering a stage where the planet is starting to flip from heating to cooling, and this is being led by the dipole excursion heading to Siberia. And once there, the Siberian traps erupt, which is when the rapid climate cooling really starts.   

The climate change model is either flawed or the one's who know the whole story are keeping it a secret. But the Doomsday Bunkers, the Seed Vaults,  and the preparations for war are telling us something, even if they don't tell us anything. If we keep accepting the bits and peices of news that they feed us, we'll eventually be featured as bits and peices on the news.   

There is a lot more still left to be said. The information is a lot easier to discern when you know where to start from, and I have a lot of information ready to write. 

**I would also like to thank everyone who's been helping me with links and additional research, and all the words of encouragement. You know who you are, and I appreciate it**.

Clocking in at $2 trillion it covers a broad range of items.  These can be broken into four major topics.  Infrastructure at home, transportation, R&D for development and manufacturing and caretaking economy.  Some high profile items include tradition infrastructure, clean water, internet expansion, electric cars, climate change R&D and many more.  This plan would be funded by increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.  This increase remains below the 35% that it was previously set at before trumps tax cuts.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/31/what-is-in-biden-infrastructure-plan/


Despite all the discussion about the details of the plan, I’ve heard very little about what people think of it.  Is it good or bad?  Is it too big?  Are we spending too much money on X?  Is portion Y of the plan not needed?  Should Biden go bolder in certain areas?  What is its biggest strength?  What is its biggest weakness?

One of the biggest attacks from republicans is a mistrust in the government to use money effectively to complete big projects like this.  Some voters believe that the private sector can do what the government plans to do both better and more cost effective.  What can Biden or Congress do to prevent the government from infamously overspending and under performing?  What previous learnings can be gained from failed projects like California’s failed railway?  

Overall, infrastructure is fairly and traditionally popular.  Yet this bill has so much in it that there is likely little good polling data to evaluate the plan.  Republicans face an uphill battle since both tax increases in rich and many items within the plan should be popular.  How can republicans attack this plan?

The Biden administration defends the loan forgiveness program, citing in particular the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. This authorizes the Department of Education to forgive the student loans of some borrowers who are at risk of default because of a ""war, military operation, or national emergency."" COVID-19, the administration argues, is a qualifying national emergency under the statute, as it was formally declared a national emergency by then-President Trump, and, subsequently, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos invoked the HEROES Act when pausing loan repayments early in the pandemic. The Biden administration argues that the need to mitigate the financial hardship caused by the pandemic has not gone away. 

Biden's plan would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and $10,000 for other borrowers, for people earning up to $125,000 a year or part of a household where total earnings are no more than $250,000. 

Six conservative states – Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – told the Supreme Court that [Biden overstepped his legal authority](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/23/student-debt-loan-relief-supreme-court-states/10761989002/) with the program and violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by embarking on a loan forgiveness program estimated to affect 40 million Americans.    

A federal judge in [Missouri dismissed the states' request](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/20/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-lawsuit-gop-states-dismissed/10556660002/) to block the program in October, ruling that they lacked standing to sue. While their case presented ""important and significant challenges to the debt relief plan,"" the trial court ruled, ""the current plaintiffs are unable to proceed."" On appeal, the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit [sided with the states' request to temporarily halt the program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/14/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-blocked-appeals-court-puts-plan-hold/10592105002/).

The Supreme Court, in January, halted [Biden's COVID-19 vaccine-or-testing mandate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/13/supreme-court-halts-bidens-covid-19-mandates-large-employers/9160176002/) for large employers.

Those decisions follow a yearslong push by conservatives to curb the ""administrative state."" They argue federal agencies should have less power to act unless there's clear congressional approval. The Supreme Court bolstered that approach in June by relying on the ""major questions doctrine"" to [decide a climate change case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/).

I subscribe to a weather blog by a meteorologist called Jeff Masters, who primarily talks about tropical cyclones and seasonal weather extremes. I wouldn't call him a climate change activist or anything, but he does mention it in the context of formerly ""extreme"" weather events seemingly becoming ""the norm"" (for instance, before 2005 there had never been more than one category five Atlantic hurricane in one year, but since 2005 we've had I think four or five years when this has been the case, including 2017). So he'd mention climate change in that context when relevant.

Lately, the comments section of this blog has been tweeted by Drudge Report a few times, and when it does, it tends to get very suddenly bombarded with political comments. On a normal day, this comments section is full of weather enthusiasts and contains almost no political discussion at all, but when it's linked by this conservative outlet, it suddenly fills up with arguments about climate change not being a real thing, and seemingly many followers of Drudge go to the blog specifically to engage in very random climate change arguments.

Watching this over the last few months has got me thinking - what is it that an ordinary, average citizen conservative has to gain from climate change being ignored policy-wise? I fully understand why big business and corporate interests have a stake in the issue - environmentalist policy costs them money in various ways, from having to change long standing practises to having to replace older, less environmentally friendly equipment and raw materials to newer, more expensive ones. Ideology aside, that at least makes practical sense - these interests and those who control them stand to lose money through increased costs, and others who run non-environmentally friendly industries such as the oil industry stand to lose *massive* amounts of money from a transition to environmentally friendly practises. So there's an easily understandable logic to their opposition.

But what about average Joe, low level employee of some company, living an ordinary everyday family life and ot involved in the realms of share prices and corporate profits? What does he or she have to gain from opposing environmentalist policies? As a musician, for instance, if I was a conservative how would it personal inconvenience me as an individual if corporations and governments were forced to adopt environmentalist policies?

Is it a fear of inflation? Is it a fear of job losses in environmentally unfriendly industries (Hillary Clinton's ""put a lot of coal miners out of business"" gaffe in Michigan last year coming to mind)? Or is it something less tangible - is it a psychological effect of political tribalism, IE ""I'm one of *these* people, and *these* people oppose climate policy so obviously *I* must also oppose it""?

Are there any popular theories about what drives opposition to environmentalist policies among ordinary, everyday citizen conservatives, which must be motivated by something very different to what motivates the corporate lobbyists?",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

How would the Republican party enact a constitutional convention? While most Republican leaders don't believe that change can happen within the upcoming 2-5 years (with only 19/34 states passing a resolution to convene a constitutional convention), they believe that Republicans can win over state legislatures and enact change independently from the Federal government or State governance. The snippet from ""The Hill"" highlights their project goals;

""*State legislators meeting at the American Legislative Exchange Council’s policy conference here...hope to use Article V of the Constitution, which allows state legislatures to call a convention to propose new amendments.*""

I think it would be popular policy, for several reasons:

1) Pre-covid, work commute was one of the largest contributors to air pollution, emitting billions of tons of CO2 annually.

2) Despite what CEOs & polls say, the overwhelming majority of office workers like working from home and saving commute time & costs. (Employers that have reopened their offices on a voluntary basis are generally seeing low attendance.) And siding with workers is politically popular.

3) Endorsing this type of policy might be less offensive to Big Business than economy-wide environmental regulations, or singling out the mining & oil industries.

4) With companies making record profits, it’s hard to suggest remote work has been a failed experiment. Instead, CEOs have been talking about “collaboration” & “company culture” to encourage workers to return.

Cons:

1) Remote work has hurt many small businesses (restaurants, etc) in financial districts. But after 1.5 years, the ones that survived have largely adopted their business models (eg catering, delivery, etc) to the situation.

2) Not every industry can work from home effectively, but most white-collar/professional jobs can, and they account for half the US labor force.

3) Many Fortune 500 CEOs & HR depts are already trying to meet workers halfway by endorsing a hybrid model (in office some days, WFH others), and jumping directly to fully remote might be a step too far. But hybrid work arrangements are very easy to rescind, and I’ve seen it happen to numerous coworkers in pre-covid times after company reorgs & new management.

After the use of sortition in Ancient Athens, it seemed to be relegated to history but in recent times there has been a revival of its study, with modern work done on ""deliberative polls"", ""minipublics"", ""Citizen Assemblies"", or other brand names. 

The concept is simple:

1. A deliberative or legislative body is constructing using random scientific sampling of a population of around 100 to 1000 members. 
2. The chosen are paid to voluntarily participate in the body called a Citizen's Assembly.
3. The assembly deliberates on a topic. 
4. There is typically a ""learning phase"" where academics educate the assembly on the topic at hand. 
5. There is an ""open forum phase"" where members of the public, interest groups, and politicians submit comments on the topic at hand. 
6. There is a ""discussion phase"" where the assembly deliberates over the proposal. 
7. There is a ""decision phase"" where members vote in favor or against proposals. 

In other words this body works much like any other legislative body, except that its members are randomly chosen. Political scientists have been experimenting with Citizen Assemblies over the years...

* They were used to [recommend Single Transferable Voting for British columbia](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032329206297147) (a ranked choice, multi-winner proportional representation system). The recommendation was however ignored in the referendum.
* Citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland to build support in [legalizing gay marriage and legalizing abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum).

* Recent Citizen Assemblies on Climate change have also been performed in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_convention_for_ecological_transition) and the UK, all where members came out in favor of increased regulations and/or taxation in order to limit carbon emissions.

From the Associated Press article:


Quick Summary: 

>Democrats approved a draft of the party platform early Saturday that includes steps to break up large Wall Street banks, advocates for a $15 an hour wage and urges the abolition of the death penalty

Defeated Sanders measures:

>Supporters of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated measures pushed by Sanders' allies that would have promoted a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system, a carbon tax to address climate change and impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracking.

Two quoted Sanders supporters' reactions:

>""We lost some but we won some,"" said James Zogby, a Sanders supporter on the panel. ""We got some great stuff in the platform that has never been in there before."" Added Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Sanders ally: ""We've made some substantial moves forward.""

**A very important thing to consider while analyzing this release:**

>The platform is a statement of the party's values and positions on a wide range of issues. While it does not bind the Democratic nominee to specific policies, it serves as a guidepost for the party moving forward.

Israeli-Palestinian Conflict:

>The committee defeated an amendment led by Zogby that would have called for providing Palestinians with ""an end to occupation and illegal settlements"" and urged an international effort to rebuild Gaza.

>The draft reflects Clinton's views and advocates working toward a ""two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict"" that guarantees Israel's security with recognized borders ""and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity.""

Vague reference to Social Security:

>The document calls for the expansion of Social Security

The $15 minimum wage:

>referring to the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a ""starvation wage""

>Sanders' allies wanted the draft to specify that a $15 per hour minimum wage should be indexed with inflation. Clinton's side struck down that idea, noting the document included a call to ""raise and index the minimum wage.""

Breaking up big banks:

>supports ways to prevent banks from gambling with taxpayers' bank deposits, ""including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall."" Sanders wants to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Clinton does not, but says her proposed financial changes would cast a wider net by regulating the banking system.

The death penalty:

>a call for the abolition of the death penalty

The TPP:

>the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP

Sanders' reaction:

>Sanders, in a statement, said he was ""disappointed and dismayed"" that the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP. But he was pleased with the proposals on Glass-Steagall and the death penalty - and vowed to fight on. ""Our job is to pass the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,"" he said.

That's everything laid out in the Associated Press article, so some very big questions arise:

1) How much did Sanders' platform and movement affect this draft? It seems there are some very clear compromises.

2) How will these compromises affect the centrists and far left that she's trying to court? Will the demographic (all and any of them) of her support change?

3) Do you think this is the kind of thing the party needed to do to get Sanders' endorsement as he outlined it yesterday?

4) What does this mean going forward going for the Democratic party? As in, there are some truly progressive measures and not so progressive measures in this draft, do you think this trend will continue and how?

5) How will this affect voters when contrasted with Trump's extremism? Is this the kind of balance and pragmatism that Clinton has been vigorously advocating for herself?

Straight from Bernie's website: 

>**Phase out the use of non-sustainable** **sources**. This plan will stop the building of new nuclear power plants and find a real solution to our existing nuclear waste problem. It will also enact a moratorium on nuclear power plant license renewals in the United States to protect surrounding communities. We know that the toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology’s benefit, especially in light of lessons learned from the Fukushima meltdown and the Chernobyl disaster. To get to our goal of 100 percent sustainable energy, we will not rely on any false solutions like nuclear, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, or trash incinerators. 

From Elizabeth Warren:

> ""In my administration, we won't be building new nuclear plants,"" Warren said at CNN's climate change town hall. ""We will start weaning ourselves off nuclear and replace it with renewables,"" she added, saying that she would aim to do so by 2035.

From a Hill article on 4 September 2019:

[Cory Booker](https://thehill.com/people/cory-booker) (D-N.J.) and businessman [Andrew Yang](https://thehill.com/people/andrew-yang) among those calling for new plants and Sen.

&#x200B;

In the beginning there was unanimity among democrats and republicans for a strong response.  As we entered the first stage of response against COVID there were cracks that started to form with debates on lockdowns and their value of hurting the economy vs risking the health of our society.  Over time this bipartisanship has devolved and to where conspiracy theories have run rampant.  The motivation to put forth bipartisan stimulus packages became less and less to the point where the last one was fully partisan.  Finally during this last stage of the COVID response we are left with a large faction of the population refusing to be vaccinated and still a large portion believing conspiracies.

As we move forward, the next global crisis is that of climate.  What does our response to COVID show tell us, the good and bad?

Could a country with the political environment of the United States attempt to give those displaced a path to new employment, while simultaneously filling a demand of the nation? I am curious if this could viably happen in a country like the US.

For example, take green energy. There will likely be many displaced from the fossil fuel industry. The government may look at national projects of interest. After identifying need, they could provide displaced workers who opted in to the program with employment, while sending them off to projects in a way that form an efficient supply chain. They do not necessarily need to be used to form the solar panels or windmills either, as these could also have their production automated for productivity.

Right now the region is facing multiple problems:

\- still not fully resolved ethnic tensions and conflicts

\- still not fully decided whose sphere of influence this region will belong to, therefore extreme confusion in foreign policy and therefore general air of instability

\- terrible demographic trends, both negative natural population growth (more deaths than births, sub-replacement fertility) AND strong emigration acting at the same time...

In spite of all this economy is not performing that bad, it had some decent growth in recent decades... BUT it's still far behind European average.

And while income per capita and human development index are much better than in true ""third world"" or developing countries, it's not the same having a certain level of development while being in Africa and having that same level of development while being in the middle of Europe and surrounded by countries like Austria, Italy, Greece, etc... We are always feeling like the worst pupil in the whole class, it's very frustrating when all the countries in your surroundings are much more developed than you.

For these reasons people are generally apathetic politically, don't believe in the system, and many are looking to emigrate.

All that being said, what remains is:

\- Balkan countries have a good, temperate climate and relatively good natural resources... Those are beautiful places to live, geographically speaking

\- They are physically extremely close to the core EU countries

\- The population density is low in comparison to EU and declining... this means a great opportunity for sustainable development as there's a lot of resources and free land per capita

\- As such, the territory could be attractive both to immigrants from Asia, and Africa (though they still often just transit through this region on their way to countries like Germany), and to foreign investors (due to low price of work)

\- It could also be interesting to tourists, or even pensioners from richer European countries (why not retire in Bosnia, and keep receiving your pension from UK or Germany... with a typical EU pension, you could live in Bosnia like a lord, enjoying great food and relaxed way of life)

But despite all this, it seems that this region is simply stuck... it's constantly lagging behind, and as decades pass people are more and more apathetic... Brain drain is huge also...

I am wondering if there's any way that these trends reverse in the future?

Can geographic proximity have some kind of diffusion effects, so that region becomes in all aspects more similar to the countries that surround it?

>State attorneys general who are selected for this program will work cooperatively with the State Impact
Center to recruit and hire NYU Fellows as SAAGs. **NYU Law will pay the salaries of the SAAGs** , and
the State Impact Center will provide ongoing support to the SAAGs and their offices. Once hired,
however , the SAA Gs' duty of loyalty shall be to the attorney general who hired them.

Eligibility requirements are described as follows:

>The opportunity to potentially hire an NYU Fell ow is open to all state attorneys general who
demonstrate a need and commitment to defending environmental values and advancing progressive
clean energy, climate change, and environmental legal positions.

In short, the program has three charactaristics:

1. State Attorneys Generals must demonstrate a commitment to fighting climate change.

2. The fellows' salaries are paid for by private donations.

3. The fellows report directly to the State Attorneys Generals.

My questions for the subreddit are:

1. Is this legal?

2. Should it be legal?

3. If it is legal, how could others across the political spectrum setup their own operations to further their agendas?

The immediate focus is to come up with something that adds to the bank balance. Economic actions that have high profit margins are heavily preferable. 

Take hunger for example. In general people have the same caloric needs, but because of the economic situations, we've stopped bothering with increasing food security to impoverished nations. People in impoverished nations are struggling to get food not because of inadequate food production, but because they have no economic value to satisfy the profit motive of food suppliers.The economic transaction doesn't work, so people go hungry.

The problem with the profit motive is that while it seems to work day to day, it doesn't extend to the long term. There are many projects out there that would be wonderful investments in the future of humanity, but we see them as cost-prohibitive on the balance sheet, despite long term pay offs. These projects are very large scale, like reducing micro-plastics in the ocean, securing water ahead of climate change, providing an education to impoverished nations, investing in a sustainable future, making politically unstable nations stable.

1) We have reached peak oil _demand_, and it will likely keep going down, not up, with world govts wanting to shift towards electric vehicles etc. There is very very little incentive for new drilling & refinery construction, as the long term future for that much oil doesn't look amazing. We will need oil for a very long time, but lesser and lesser amounts.

2) There is much debate over how much oil should really cost. Some say it should indeed have eyewatering prices to reflect the true cost of burning oil at all. But mostly the consensus appears to be that prices this high only hurt the working class while they have little options otherwise.

So what can the world governments actually do? Due to low competition (and unlikely future competition), oil companies will want to squeeze out as much profit as they can. What are some reasonable steps governments can take to mitigate this while still mitigating climate change?

By all normal metrics, last night was a blowout for the Republican Party.  They won the Senate by a larger than expected margin, their largest share of House seats in history, and despite a number of difficult races only lost one or two state Governors.   And they did it without putting forth any sort of defined agenda, or making any significant changes to the party platform.

On the other hand, look at the ballot measures.  In several spots across the nation, people voted in favor of legalizing marijuana, raising the minimum wage, and opposing attempts to outlaw abortion; all positions out of alignment with the current GOP platform.  Demographics of voters skewed towards the elderly, a voting demographic that will become increasingly unreliable to turn elections as the Baby Boomers die off.  And exit polling showed that Hilary Clinton is still the preferred Presidential frontrunner for 2016.

I worry that today’s win will convince the Republican party that it can keep pushing the same Reagan era talking points and still keep winning elections.  To some extent, they probably can keep the House/Senate, if not under their control; at least enough seats to maintain some ability to manipulate the Legislative agenda, due to the way Democratic population concentrations favor the GOP.  On the other hand, the GOP has lost the popular vote in five of the last six Presidential elections, and 2016 looks to continue the trend.  This is more significant than usual though, because if the GOP fails to take the Presidency in 2016, there is a very good chance that the ideological makeup of the SCOTUS will shift to favoring a Democratic agenda.  A SCOTUS under progressive control stands to tip the country sharply in favor of the Democrats.  Imagine if they had got their way on Citizen’s United for example: Their allies in the media would still be able to advocate in favor of particular candidates, but third parties would be largely prohibited from producing political content (If you don’t believe me, read the transcripts of the government lawyer arguing that the law would have given them the power to ban entire books if they contained a single sentence advocating for a particular candidate).

I believe if the Republican Party is going to remain relevant as more than a regional party going forward, they need to embrace dramatic change.  It will be a challenge, as they have to maintain the tenuous alliance they have built of business interests, nationalists, social conservatives, and libertarian leaning conservatives.  They need to reach out to minorities and young voters, becoming significantly more libertarian leaning on issues like gay marriage and the drug war.  They need to look at sentencing and criminal justice reform.  They also need to find a more coherent position on the issue of abortion, the position that abortions should be prohibited except in the case of rape/incest doesn’t make any sense from the “fetus is a person” position, and the position that no abortions should be allowed at all is largely impossible to run on except in deep red states (I argue the line should be when fetal brain activity starts, but that’s really its own entire discussion).  They need to start taking climate change seriously.  They need to stop supporting legacy rent seeking companies, and instead support innovative companies like Telsa (full disclosure, Tesla investor, so I’m slightly biased) They need to listen to their own economists, and stop trying to and prevent the flow of labor across the border (Giving out citizenship is another issue, and one they can make a better argument against in most cases), as well as advocating for deporting all illegal immigrants, alienating the Hispanic community.  They need to come up with solid counter to Democratic arguments for constantly raising the minimum wage (a robust negative income tax or maybe even a basic minimum income being the obvious solutions advocated by many conservative economists), especially as increased automation continues to eat into the job market.

Renewalables are inherently intermittent power sources. The sun only shines during the day and the wind doesn't blow all the time. These sources of energy could never completely replace fossil fuels, since you would need a reliable source of energy that could scale up when the intermittent sources went out (i.e. at night or on a cloudy day). Hydro power is an exception to this, but we have already dammed most of the available sites, and many people also seem to be against damming since it destroys the environment through flooding.

Perhaps the above could be solved with a scalable long term storage solution, but when/if that technology will be developed is anyone's guess.

Nuclear power is extremely reliable and safe. We've been operating nuclear reactors in this country for 60 years, with only one major incident that pales in comparison to deaths from explosions fossil fuel plants throughout the years. We've been operating nuclear reactors on submarines and ships for around that long as well.

There's an issue with storage of radioactive waste, but that problem would virtually disappear if we simply reprocessed the radioactive material (would also make nuclear power cheaper). 

And yes, nuclear has large capital costs, but a big reason for that is the amount of scrutiny the NRC puts on the nuclear energy industry, which is much higher than other energy industries.

* Thinks that we should support the rebels in Syria, but not directly involve ourselves

* Thinks that we should cooperate with both European and Middle Eastern countries to defeat ISIS

* Thinks that the US should stay a firm ally of Israel

74,Jim Webb won the debate & here's why.,90.0,3oq99b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3oq99b/jim_webb_won_the_debate_heres_why/,236.0,1444834133.0,"In case you missed it, the Democratic Presidential debate was last night. If you have been following the campaigns you like most thought this was a 3 headed race, and barely that. It was narrated as a Clinton v. Sanders Battle Royale, with an O'Malley in the mix.

Literally every single story I've read and heard leading up to this debate and throughout the entire campaign season has focused on those three individuals. Tuning to CNN last night it was much to my surprise to see five candidates on the stage. Let's leave Chaffee out of this (I'm not sure he was all there anyways), and focus on the other four.

So we know the story of Clinton, we know what Democratic Socialist Sanders stands for (it's reddit after-all), O'Malley might not be as well known, but he didn't give me much reason to want to know more about him. However there was this other fellow on stage who was captivating, Jim Webb.

From the first answer he gave last night he had my attention. 

Cooper asked ""Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?""

*No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race.*

What an answer? Am I right? 

It was a prelude to a night filled with some of the most reasonable and responsible rhetoric I'd ever heard from a candidate. This is coming from someone who considers themselves a Republican.

Some of the highlights:

When people were going on about the gun debate and talking about how we need more gun control, or I did this, or I voted for this... Webb comes through with the only answer that actually makes sense.

*Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that.*

*A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.*

*WEBB: So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.*

*COOPER: Senator...*

*WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.*

You can't ask people living in places where a police officer is more than 30 minutes or an hour away to not be able to protect themselves. Not everyone lives in urban Baltimore Mr. O'malley & not everyone has bodyguards 24/7 Mrs. Clinton.

When talking about military force and whether or not it should have been used in Lybia. Webb, once again takes the issue and breaks it down into the components that really need to be examined.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?*

*WEBB: Look, let's start -- I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.*

*Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.*

Talking about the things happening in the Middle East without equating the cause & effect is pointless. The candidates looked for the rebuttal their constituents wanted to hear. Webb, answered the question with facts.

Further supporting his view with reasons and basis for why it is what is:

*This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.*

*There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings.*

*It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.*

The conversation moved on to talk about Webb's decorated service and it is quite decorative. I sort of feel bad for only hearing about him last night, because the man is an American hero. When Cooper tried to engage him into calling out Sanders for dodging the Vietnam war. Webb eloquently said it's each mans choice, but that if you were looking for a Commander & Chief he is the most qualified. 

Isn't that true?

Who of those candidates, or of any on either side, are more qualified?

When Chafee tried to question Webb on his opinion that the Iran deal weakened America's position in the region. Webb once again retorted with a clear an accurate answer.

*I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.*

Btw, the only candidate to every mention Israel and our ally, in a debate which focused on the Middle East for a large swath of time.

Cooper asked each candidate what is the greatest threat to the U.S. Instead of giving an answer to a question that is way too complicated with a simplicity, like each other candidate did. Webb once again gives us an answer rooted in facts, understanding & reason-ability. 

*Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.*

Topics moved towards immigration and once again Webb seemed to be the only one that actually had a level headed approach to dealing with the issue. He was the only one on stage that said ""No country has -- is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue"". 

He actually presented a balanced answer that I think most Americans would support and his political history shows he has actually acted upon what he says. *I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.*

Every other candidate, especially O'Malley seem to think a country with no borders is a better America. I ask him to go look at how Europe is currently doing economically with those kinds of careless policies.

When talking about the NSA, Webb once again provides an answer that isn't just meant to rile up support, but actually rooted in reason. 

*We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought -- if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.*

Would anyone be opposed to that? We know we need to be protected, but that doesn't mean endless surveillance for endless time. I know I'm on video when I walk into a store, but that video doesn't need to be kept forever, and accessed by the privileged, if there is no reason. That's a sensible approach.

Speaking of sensible a lot of what was said on that stage is never going to happen. Sanders and his socialistic ideals are never going to pass in Congress. I know he wants a revolution, but Capitalist America isn't just going to become Denmark. 

Webb actually presented ideas that are possible, that can be done in a divided Congress. When asked about how he differed from Obama, he once again presents reasoned & accurate assessments.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?*

*WEBB: I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I -- Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.*

*I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead -- working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).*

It seemed like every candidate forgot that they wouldn't be issuing executive orders all day and that they would actually have to work with the Republicans to get things done. Can anyone tell me how in the hell Sanders would get anything that he wants done?

The conversation moved on to global warming. 

Candidates like O'Malley tried to tell us how we need wind turbines to fix our problems. Then Webb had his chance to defend his ""very different view"" as Cooper put it.

*You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are -- again, are you -- the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?*

*WEBB: Well, the -- the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?*

*And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.*

*We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on -- on doing that. The -- the agreements -- the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the -- of the Chinese government itself.*

*So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a -- a way to address climate change.*

Ding, ding, ding guess what Senator O'Malley Iowa's turbines don't mean anything when China & India are polluting the planet. To try and fix a global problem with domestic policy is quite possibly the most disingenuous thing one can do.

Webb wasn't given much of a chance to say the things he wanted, but when he forced his way into the conversation he said so much that made sense to me. He gave reasoned answers, he gave plausible solutions & he addressed concerns that so many either are unaware of, or have been sold a false narrative on.

Webb concluded his limited time with his closing statement:

*You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.*

*One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.*

*We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.*

*I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of -- of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.*

I always considered myself a Republican, but after watching the debate last night Senator Webb gave me a reason to believe in the Democratic party. I never thought I would say that. 

Webb is a man that I can stand behind and say, you know what, he actually represents me. He's not a career politician. He wasn't raised with a silver spoon. He has an immigrant wife who lived the American dream, and he wants to protect it. To make sure it exists for our future generations, like it did for her. He is a qualified Commander & Chief. 

Webb might not have been known by many before last night, but he certainly is known by many today. I hope those of you who think you already know who you are voting for will look at Webb and ask yourself, why not him. I know I will, and so far I haven't come up with a reason to say no.

TL;DR- Webb, a virtual unknown to many, came out on the debate stage and proved he is knowledgeable, qualified & reasonable. The only candidate that seems to be able to break the divide in Congress, the only one who isn't a career politician. Someone who wasn't raised with money & who's life is an example of the American Dream. Look at the debate and the things he said, and I think you too will come away with a greater appreciation for him.

I'd very much like to preamble this post by saying that the following is not to say that the other candidates are better, it's just my opinion of Mr. Sanders' position as the ""least-worst"" candidate.

Anyway, let's get to it. I'm sourcing all of his points from [his website](https://berniesanders.com/?nosplash=true/) under the ""[issues](https://berniesanders.com/issues)"" page. I'll break down point by point on where I see a flaw or lack in logic or possibility of actually happening. I'll also acknowledge each point I agree with.

 - **Income and Wealth inequality**

I acknowledge that there is a large difference between the income of the 1% and the bottom 99%. I'd really like to focus on this paragraph:

> Despite huge advancements in technology and productivity, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. The real median **income of male workers is $783 less than it was 42 years ago**; while the real median **income of female workers is over $1,300 less than it was in 2007**. That is unacceptable and that has got to change.

See, a *lot* of politicians love to talk about how men earn more than women to make themselves appeal to a wider group of voters. If you really look at it though, it makes no sense at all. If we were to apply the logic that women get paid less, then businesses would ONLY hire women, because they're cheap labor. This is obviously not the case, so if we were to apply the logic further then we would conclude that even though they're cheap labor, businesses hire more men because they're smarter and better at conducting business. This is also very obviously not the case.

The statistics factored into fueling this myth only account for the average earnings of all men and women that work full-time. It does *not* account for differences in occupations, education, positions, or hours worked per week. 

[Here's an article you can read on that](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html).

 - **It’s Time to Make College Tuition Free and Debt Free**

[Here's a great article/summary](http://www.investors.com/politics/capital-hill/heres-what-bernie-sanders-doesnt-want-you-to-know-about-college-costs/) of a study by economists Grey Gordon and Aaron Hedlund. I especially enjoyed the closing sentence; ""But who has time for such inconvenient truths when a presidential contender is waiving a banner saying 'free stuff.'""

I recommend you read the article for yourself, but basically what it is saying is that the real culprit for the rise in college costs is federal aid. 

> ""What did account for almost all of it was, ironically enough, the massive explosion in federal aid over the past several decades. Federal aid — in the form of subsidized loans, grants and tax credits — shot up 134% in the past 15 years, according to the College Board. It’s climbed 22% just under President Obama.""

After seeing these kinds of things brought to light, it's really hard to support Bernie (in this topic).

 - **Getting Big Money Out of Politics and Restoring Democracy** 

This one is pretty much spot on. I have no complaints. I have no idea how he'll do it, but I have no complaints.

 - **Creating Jobs Rebuilding America**

From [his page](https://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-jobs-rebuilding-america/);

> ""Today, the U.S. spends less than 2 percent of GDP on infrastructure, less than at any point in the last twenty years. Meanwhile, Europe spends close to twice our rate, and China spends close to four times our rate.""

Notice how he doesn't specify which countries in Europe. If he's using an average to get that number, then that'd mean that some are lower and some are higher. Also notice how he says that China spends close to four times our rate. Well, guess what Bernie, China makes literal ghost ~~towns~~ [cities](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/07/20/what-will-become-of-chinas-ghost-cities/#6f292224751b) where nobody lives and is now questioning its economy's ability to grow. Some of its workers are taking a raise in their pay and companies are leaving ([source](http://www.dw.com/en/us-firms-moving-out-of-china/a-18994088)), meaning all that infrastructure investment is at a huge risk of being for nothing. China should not be a comparison. 

Anyone that understands the economic situation in China or cares even the slightest bit to look into it can ""debunk"" Bernie's comparison. However, it is true that the U.S' current infrastructure is deteriorating heavily. 

> Senator Sanders’ Rebuild America Act would more than **double the current level of funding** for the highway and transit accounts of the Highway Trust Fund, and would ***create*** **a National Infrastructure Bank** to leverage **private capital** to finance more than $125 billion in new projects.

He's pretty ambitious about creating all these new channels of tax revenue. Almost all his plans are field by a ""to-be"" ""wishlist"" system of taxes. He'd have enormous trouble creating that bank, let alone getting it to function properly *on top of his proposed tax increases*. It just wouldn't work. If taxes are already being boosted across the board, then not many/enough people will want to poor even more money into his system. 

> Further, investing in infrastructure is not just about “bricks and mortar.”   At its core, it is about jobs and the economy.

> While the economy has improved significantly since the worst days of the recession, our nation still faces a major jobs crisis.  We need to **create millions of decent paying jobs**, and we need to create them now.  And infrastructure spending is one of the best ways to do just that.

So he'll create a higher minimum wage which will kill small businesses and franchises but he'll also raise the taxes so it'll cancel out a lot of the increase anyway. This is purely irrational thinking and there's an incredibly small chance he'll even get it passed the republican congress. If anything, create a mandate that minimum wage will be re-evaluated every three years to **keep up with inflation**, not to invent arbitrary numbers. People argue that if they raise minimum wage to $15, then kids can afford to fund their own college tuition. This is not the case at all. The cost of college tuition has far outrun $15 an hour. The only way to do it at this point would be to have minimum wage rise to inflation (much closer to $11) then reduce federal aid for college tuition, hence lowering what colleges can charge.

 - **A Living Wage**

Some issues listed on the [page](https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-living-wage/):

1. ""Millions of Americans are working for totally inadequate wages. We must ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. The current federal minimum wage is starvation pay and must become a living wage. We must increase it to $15 an hour over the next several years.""

This makes sense for a Starbucks in Manhattan or a busy area where the revenue and workload is high enough to justify a $15 an hour pay. In some times of the year, some locations of X or Y restaurant won't make money for weeks on end. Other locations profit's are shared across the region to cover for lost revenue from those seasonal locations. An Outback Steakhouse in a beach town on the east coast will make huge amounts of money during the summer, but will ultimately be unprofitable during the winter months. Raising the wage wouldn't necessarily hurt those large chain restaurants, but it would destroy the prospects of small businesses that can't cover losses as easily (if at all). 

2. ""We must also establish equal pay for women. It’s unconscionable that women earn less than men for performing the same work.""

Yeah, we already covered this. It's truly shocking that people can't see past this pandering and makes me question the political awareness of Sanders supporters. If Sander's campaign slogan were more accurate, it wouldn't say ""Feel the Bern"", but much close to ""Sanders panders""

3. ""Millions of American employees have been working 50 or 60 hours a week while receiving no overtime pay. That is why Bernie has been encouraging the Obama Administration to ensure that more workers receive overtime pay protection.""

This is a good point, nothing really wrong here.

4. ""Led the effort to increase the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour."" 

And this is about where it should stop. A **50%** boost to $15 dollars is absolutely ridiculous for most franchises, let alone small businesses. That 50% adds up to five to six figure sums required of small businesses throughout the year and will undoubtedly lead to job loss and more burden on the welfare system.

***

 - **Combating Climate Change to Save the Planet**

I have no issue with the general direction but I do have a gripe with an aspect of his plan. On [this page](https://berniesanders.com/people-before-polluters/) under ""Invest in clean, sustainable energy"", Sanders lists replacements for coal energy as being ""energy efficiency, solar, wind and geothermal.""

If Bernie Sanders was as adamant about creating higher standards for the construction and safety of nuclear power plants as he is about taxing the rich and fixing gender-related wage gaps that don't really exist, then we would have the cleanest and most **cost-effective** energy grid on the planet. 

***

***

 - **A Fair and Humane Immigration Policy**

This page was arranged weirdly in little bits that didn't really elaborate and only linked to ""Share on Twitter"" pages but if I had to pick one, I'd disagree with where it says ""Employ humanitarian parole to ensure the return of unjustly deported immigrants and unify broken families.""

Yeah, that's obviously a tough call. I'd honestly go the conservative route here. Just establish a filter process for some of the existing illegal immigrants to be deported, as it would be expensive to send them all back. While that's being done, limit new illegal immigrants otherwise the problem will repeat itself.

***

***

 - **Racial Justice**

In my opinion, a huge reason this issue is even being discussed on the level it's being discussed is because of Ferguson. 
 Two things about that: 

1. Nobody knows which party was actually in the wrong.

2. Nobody *forced* the people of Ferguson to riot. They did that on their own. It wasn't protesting, it was a full-on exploitation of chaos to steal things that didn't belong to them. They destroyed their city with an utter lack of logic and other poor African Americans (Can I just say black people?) across the country made the decision (along with, probably, a bit of the [mob mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality)) to ""protest"" and ultimately destroyed their own hometown. 

Aside from the reason it's such a hot-topic, I acknowledge that there is a chance that there's some truth behind what their initial issue was and that it should be addressed. But this idea that people think black lives don't matter is completely off-base and it's an issue which could be handled a *lot* better than it is being handled from BOTH parties.

 - **Fighting for Women’s Rights**

> Many of the achievements that have been made for women’s rights in the 20th century have been under attack by the Republican party — denying women control over their own bodies, preventing access to vital medical and social services, and blocking equal pay for equal work.

I agree with Bernie on this one. The GOP is valuing humans that have never seen the light of day over humans that are fully aware and able to make decisions for themselves. It's wrong and probably one of the few reasons why Bernie could still have my vote, on top of LGBT rights.

 - **Fighting for LGBT Equality**

***

 - **Caring for our Veterans**

This is a really important issue. 

> Sen. Sanders believes that just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war, so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war.

This is very well put. The well being of our veterans should be very high on the list of priorities and I believe it's one of the few areas where the GOP and the Democrats can agree.

***

***

 - **Medicare for All**

It's another one of those grids that lead to Twitter share pages. I'll pick one like last time. 

> ""We must ensure all Americans can access the health care they need regardless of their income.""

I don't think I could agree more on this one. I don't know how Bernie will pull this off along with his other big issues, but I hope if he gets elected that he can thoroughly address this issue. One of my greatest fears is having an issue that I can't resolve due to financial limitations. For those of you Breaking Bad fans (so, pretty much all of you, in other words), the part where (and I'll try to mitigate spoiling it for those who have been living under a rock) a certain hairless, caucasian gets shot and needs therapy to walk again and he **can't afford** the program where it's most likely he'll heal was pretty scary to me. I can't imagine the future of my mobility being on the line due to financial shortcomings.

 - **Fighting for Disability Rights**

> “The Americans with Disabilities Act established a clear national mandate that we as a nation have a moral responsibility to ensure that all Americans have access to the programs and the support needed to contribute to society, live with dignity, and achieve a high quality of life.”

This is true and I agree with this point.

 - **Strengthen and Expand Social Security**

This is true and I hope that Social Security stops being a [piggy bank](http://dailysignal.com/2015/10/27/budget-deal-kicks-the-can-on-disability-insurance-robs-150-billion-from-social-security/) for other issues. 

***

***

 - **Fighting to Lower Prescription Drug Prices**

I honestly think this should just fit under ""Medicare for all"", which I addressed above. Perhaps Sanders knew that too, but isolating this in the midst of the Shkreli issue would attract more voters. I do, though, think this is a more realistic issue for Sanders to fix than the Medicare for all idea.

***

***

 - **Improving the Rural Economy**

> Expand support for young and beginning farmers

""By raising their employees' minimum pay to $15, cutting into their profits and ruining any chance of that""


To be more serious, though, I hope he can do this. Part of the reason that young farms or even small-time farmers struggle compared to the big ""factory farms"" is the economy of scale. It's like Tesla's Gigafactory, but for crops and dairy instead of batteries and cars. Factory farm owners have the money to own huge amounts of land and invest to streamline production (although very cruel) to maximize profits. Perhaps tax breaks should be given to beginning farmers or farmers with small amounts of land but given the rest of Sanders' propositions, a tax break seems very unlikely.

***

***

 - **Reforming Wall Street**

I don't think that there's any way to actually ""break up the big banks"" but I do believe that there should be heavier restrictions on credit/mortgages, I believe the highest allowable debt-to-income is 43% annually. That's ridiculous. The cap should be in the high 30% range, and even that is questionable/dangerous. We do not need another housing bubble.

> Supports capping credit card interest rates at 15%.

This makes sense but seems more reactive than proactive. It should be implemented **along with** mandatory financial literacy classes for people signing up for a credit card. A big reason that some people find themselves in a place where they're paying that kind of interest rate is due to utter and complete financial illiteracy, by a huge amount of people in this country. 

***

***

 - **Real Family Values**

> we are the only nation that doesn’t require employers to provide at least 10 days of paid vacation time.

This should be implemented in **career level** positions. I'm not sure how realistic it is for a career McDonald's worker, but a person pursuing a career at a place they've worked hard for at a number of years should have this. I'm disappointed that he didn't elaborate on **how** he would reach this goal. He just talked about how bad it is and how great it would be. Seems like more pandering, honestly.

***

***

 - **War and Peace**

> Sen. Sanders **considers his vote against the Iraq War to be one of the most important he has cast**, and **believes that the invasion in Iraq was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in modern U.S. history**. As a leader in the opposition to the war in Iraq, much of what then Congressman Sanders feared would happen has, in fact, occurred.

See, this is what worries me. Sanders only really has experience voting yes, voting no, not really being held accountable for the decisions. Christ Christie got into this when grilling Rubio. In that paragraph, it just shows that all he has to show is how he feels about individual votes. It's a respectable position (as Chris Christie said), but it just appears in these situations that it won't prepare him to become the President. 

***

***

 - **War Should Be the Last Option: Why I Support the Iran Deal**

To be perfectly honest, I never kept up with the news about the Iran Deal so I think it'd be unfair for me to state an opinion of something I have really no idea about. 

***

***

 - **Making the Wealthy, Wall Street, and Large Corporations Pay their Fair Share**

> Even worse, several large corporations in recent years have exploited so many loopholes in the tax code that they have paid nothing in federal income taxes and have actually received tax rebates from the IRS.

Yeah, this should be fixed for sure. 

> Senator Sanders would prevent corporations that are American for all practical purposes from avoiding U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company through the establishment of a post office box in a tax haven country.

This may cause the companies to flee the U.S. and establish legitimate headquarters there. This would mean that they'd be gone for good. I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I feel Trump would handle this issue the best of all the candidates. I don't like him, but he has top notch experience in that area and can negotiate from the perspective of someone who has experienced, rather than humble Sanders who prides himself in *not* experiencing it. This could lead to a corporate tax revenue disaster.

80,PROTESTS and their efficacy: Invaluable changemakers or narcissism hubs?,77.0,qm3w3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/qm3w3b/protests_and_their_efficacy_invaluable/,115.0,1635972543.0,"A post on another sub got me thinking about protests, and how their nature and efficacy may have changed throughout time.  I have attended some protests in my time, but I don't like the ones which block roads and disrupt people's days. I live in a very environmentalist city, which is good, but some of the climate action protests have prevented people from seeing loved ones in hospital, going to funerals, and so on. They often don't even target government buildings, just march down busy streets waving signs and getting pics taken.

There was one case where a man was prevented from saying goodbye to his dying father in hospital because Extinction Rebellion had blocked his route:  [Man unable to reach dying father’s bedside after getting stuck in Extinction Rebellion traffic (telegraph.co.uk)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/18/man-unable-reach-dying-fathers-bedside-getting-stuck-extinction/)

The common response to this, is that disrupting people's days is the whole point. Disruption brings attention to an issue. Well, I'd challenge anyone saying that to put yourself in that bereaved man's shoes, or the shoes of a pregnant woman who can't get to the hospital, or someone in critical need of A&E, or someone getting to a funeral, etc etc.

A possible counter-point is a utilitarian one: these grave cases are anomalous and may be worth the outcome of the protest. Another way of phrasing this is: ""the suffering caused by the protest is less than the suffering that would be caused if the protest had not taken place"". Obviously this seems wrong when applied to an individual protest - lets say for argument's sake it's Extinction Rebellion - so let's apply it to the global movement as a whole. Measuring suffering will always be difficult given the lack of objective metrics but, even considering that, the proposition seems lofty. Would you confidently say, for example, ""100 people who can't get to emergency treatment in A&E is worth the global run of XR protests taking place""?

There is also the argument that disruption may actually turn people \*against\* the cause that the protest is promoting. So then you get into tricky territory of measuring ""those awakened by the protest"" to ""those turned off by the protest""...

Another counter-point is that this is the fault of the police and/or municipal government (rather than the protestors) for not organising proper traffic diversions. I suppose this would be region-dependent. Some places mandate for protests to inform the government of their ""where and whens"" and for the government/police to divert traffic accordingly. Counter-counter-point: the ordinary person (say, trying to get to A&E) cannot be faulted for not being aware of the planned diversions.

3 more questions:

1. Do you think protests actually work? By ""work"" I mean ""cause at least some positive impact toward their stated goal, either directly or indirectly"". Please explain why you believe this to be the case or not *(I will talk about one case example in the comments)*.
2. Do you think the efficacy of protest has changed over time? For the better or for the worse? Like, were protests more or less impactful in the civil rights era than they are now?
3. If you disagree that protests have meaningful efficacy, what do you think are some effective means of enacting political change in lieu of them?

I will leave you with this recent quote from the British documentary-maker Adam Curtis:

>""The civil rights movement was the last time that young activists went down to the south of America and went through incredible danger for years (because it did take years). Many got beaten up, some were killed and we still don’t know their names. They gave themselves up to something. We know some of the leaders but the majority of people, we don’t know them but they gave themselves up to something good.  
>  
>Then came individualism. I remember the march against the Iraq invasion in my country – its slogan was “Not in My Name”. I don’t care whether it’s in your name or not! I just don’t want the war. It had this narcissistic shroud over it and that was the moment at which you think “How can collectivism really work when you’re dealing with millions and millions of squealing piglets who want to “express themselves”. That’s the real problem – radicalism always has to “express itself” these days. Maybe real radicalism is not about expressing yourself, it’s giving yourself up to something that you believe in.""",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

I was honestly not impressed by a lot of the questions here, sorry.

Then I was thinking of a question regarding education and loans or Common Core, but my father jumped into another guy's question with John and started arguing about the lack of bargaining power the government has with pharmaceutical companies, and they went back and forth a few times.  After that I felt like I wouldn't get called on to ask a question and I thought it would be improper to try, so I listened in silence.

The fact that it has been almost an entire year since the scandal broke, and nothing meaningful has happened since, makes me wary that any kind of ""other boot"" is about to drop. And on top of that, we have every reason to believe that the DNC properly vetted her (including the possibility that this Email thing could escalate and blow up) months ago. So unless the FBI is just obscenely slow AND the DNC are comically incompetent at vetting their own candidates, I'd say there's little to be worried about, if you're a Clinton Supporter.

But what I've been mulling over in particular is the question of what, exactly, is supposed to be the grand harm that Clinton might have caused. What could Clinton have possibly done that would justify Prison Time? And irrespective of that first part, what could she have done that would destroy her credibility as a potential leader?

I mean, there's the possibility that she leaked Classified Information, but we've already had many people (both on this subreddit and in other locations) corroborate that:

* Classification of State Secrets is a notoriously finicky system; 
 * The name of a program and the functionality of a program can be unclassified, but the two together can be classified
 * Classification happens regardless of public knowledge, which means that if the government decides that ""The Sky is Blue"" is classified information, then a Government Official couldn't confirm that the sky were blue, even if an ordinary person could look and observe that the sky is indeed blue
 * Different arms of the government have different standards for what is classified and what isn't, and they are known to contradict each other
* Intent and Breadth of the breach are quite important;
 * ""Accidentally"" leaking classified information can result in a loss of security clearance, but infrequently results in jail time.
 * If tiny, inconsequential information is leaked, it's unlikely to result in a revocation of Security Clearance or jail time.

So if it is indeed true that she leaked classified information: **what were the consequences?**

* Did someone die?
* Did she blow someone's cover?
* Did a state secret get leaked to an enemy?
* Did she cause harm to a diplomatic situation?
* Did someone lose/gain money because of it?
* Did she change the outcome of a political process?
* Did she allow an enemy to leverage political clout over us?
* Did she knowingly facilitate a plan to harm America?
* Did she accelerate the rate of Global Climate Change to dangerous levels?

Will it push further to the right on policy issues, stand where it is, or take a u-turn to more moderate initiatives? 

Which demographics will the GOP primarily target? How will this have changed from the pre-Trump era to the post-Trump era?

Will the GOP embrace Trump's legacy, or steer away from it? Will we see Trump copycats in 2024 or beyond? How effective would these campaigns be?

* Young progressives: made up by generally by young white males, (and according to 538, increasingly Hispanic) that do not fit well within the Democratic Party. They often do not feel heard and support candidates like Bernie Sanders and AOC. They dominate social media like Reddit and Twitter, but that’s the biggest extent of their support. Because they are young, they are are less likely to come out to vote. Ideologically they tend to be very anti-capitalistic. 
* Pragmatic progressives: the largest demographic within the party, most diverse in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation, social class etc. They are represented by candidates like Obama, Biden, Clinton etc. The group the tries to balance social progress with economic one. 
* Moderates: a dying demographic (both literally and figuratively), predominately old and might even have social conservative values but feel they don’t belong in GOP because they are non-white, yet are significantly large in number because older generations are more numerous than younger ones in general and are a reliable group in polls.

Biden’s campaign appeal to pragmatic progressives and moderates the most, which make up the largest number of voters in the party, and strategically more important in the electoral college, because they are predominantly found in the Midwest and South. His campaign goes as far as ignoring young progressives due to:

1. their unreliability in polls; young people don’t go out to vote in general
2. the fact that pragmatic progressives and moderates do not like them (it’s a mutual feeling, pragmatic progressives and moderates make up the establishment wing of the party). If he appeals to progressives, he loses his core demographics, if he doesn’t, which is what he is doing now, well, he loses young progressives. 

It’s a lose-lose situation and Biden has made his choice, he has picked the (far) lesser loss. But, what could have another candidate done in such way he didn’t alienate either group while knowing well how much these hate one-another?

Some might say Obama did in 2008, because Obama appeared at exactly the right time: there was a strong desire to show change and advancement in racial issues, social media was not as toxic as now because ads and clickbait had not evolved as much today, there was an increasing distaste for the wars in Middle East and the economic crisis which happened under then current Republican administration.

I really tried to be as thorough as possible, so my apologies for the length. If you want a TL;DR, start at the conclusion.

In June 2011, Politifact published their review of the claim made by Jon Stewart regarding FOX having the most consistently misinformed citizenry.

I rely on websites like Politifact and FactCheck to give an often reliable if not a baseline answer on the validity of political claims. They often do an excellent job regardless of partisanship; but every time I revisit this claim it strikes me as lacking merit for its ""False"" verdict.

[Here's the PolitiFact article](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/)

[Here's the extended-interview where Stewart makes the claim while being a guest on Chris Matthew's show](http://youtu.be/XV2MxD779c0)

In terms of the knowledge of FOX viewers, I've researched this quite  for a while now, and I have to say that to a degree Politifact's answer requires a reexamination of the evidence presented. Given the reasoning below, I believe PolitiFact is obligated to merit Stewart at the very least, a Half-Truth going by their own rubric:

There was evidence then, and there is more evidence now to suggest much validity in Stewart's claim. Keep in mind I'm not looking for a ""True"" verdict. But my intention is to convince you, and politifact, that it merits either a Half-True or Mostly-True verdict.

[FOX News reported the biggest errors/misperceptions during the Iraq War, having the largest audience who believed in clear falsehoods[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Tests_of_knowledge_of_Fox_viewers) — this refers to the 2003 study as cited in the Politifact article.

[Under Political Knowledge, Fox News is in the bottom quarter of news outlets, with NPR and Daily Show occupying the top 5[2]](http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/) — this is a more recent study by PEW compared to the referenced 2007 one in the article.

[Further study showing FOX at the bottom and Daily Show and NPR at the top **PDF**[3]](http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/final.pdf)

>In most cases those who had greater levels of exposure to news sources had lower levels of misinformation. **There were, however, a number of cases where greater exposure to a particular news source increased misinformation on some issues.**

>(Those who watched Fox News almost daily were significantly more likely than those who never watched it to believe that most economists estimate the stimulus caused job losses (8 points more likely), most economists have estimated the health care law will worsen the deficit (31 points), the economy is getting worse (26 points), most scientists do not agree that climate change is occurring (30 points), the stimulus legislation did not include any tax cuts (14 points), their own income taxes have gone up (14 points), the auto bailout only occurred under Obama (13 points), when TARP came up for a vote most Republicans opposed it (12 points) and that it is not clear that Obama was born in the United States (31 points). The effect was also not simply a function of partisan bias, as people who voted Democratic and watched Fox News were also more likely to have such misinformation than those who did not watch it--though by a lesser margin than those who voted Republican.

There were cases with some other news sources as well. Daily consumers of MSNBC and public broadcasting (NPR and PBS) were higher (34 points and 25 points respectively) in believing that it was proven that the US Chamber of Commerce was spending money raised from foreign sources to support Republican candidates. Daily watchers of network TV news broadcasts were 12 points higher in believing that TARP was signed into law by President Obama, and 11 points higher in believing that most Republicans oppose TARP."" — [source](http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brunitedstatescanadara/671.php?nid=&id=&pnt=671&l)

The PolitiFact article explicitly notes the validity of some studies supporting Stewart's claim, but refuses to have this weigh on the final-decision in any way. To list this answer as False is grossly misleading on its own. 

To pick apart these studies without granting them weight in the conclusion is contradictory to what was done with the analysis of the PEW studies. PolitiFact cherry-picked out those studies indicating FOX at the bottom (or low-end) of the ranking and then cherry-picked *in* the certain shows within the FOX conglomerate that did well. Just as with every other media-source, it should be understood that we're looking at the viewership as a whole. PolitiFact pulled a subset to erroneously represent all of FOX, which conflicts with the claim's wording. This is important because Jon did not isolate O'Reilly, he explicitly says, ""Fox.""

This appears to be the case with the 2007, and 2008 study analysis. In the 2008 study, however, it's noted CNBC, Local, and Network news ranks just below FOX. In the 2010 study, they manage to beat CNN and MSNBC. That's fair, but they're not far off either, and overall they're once more near the bottom of the knowledge-spectrum. Finally, an updated 2012 publication of the same news-media analysis by PEW indicates FOX effectively drops further, now losing to MSNBC and CNN [Source here again](http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/).

>But a few were in a bit grayer area, often asking respondents to gauge what experts have concluded about policy trends.

>One was, ""Is it your impression that most economists who have studied it estimate that the stimulus has created (a) saved or created several million jobs, (b) saved or created a few jobs, or (c) caused job losses.""

The writer appears to disregard that this judgement on the stimulus was performed by a panel of 55-60 Economists of the WSJ, one of the most [trusted news sources.](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/section-1-media-sources-distinct-favorites-emerge-on-the-left-and-right/). Additionally, according to the 2010 PEW study, the WSJ actually outpaced every other network in the news—possibly due to how economically-driven current-events were at the time. Additionally, the CBO agreed, for which Politifact uses as a regular source as well in its fact-checking claims. 

The primary disclaimer for why these studies are irrelevant is quoted, here:

>We think there’s a difference between bestowing a False rating on an elected official -- whose job it is to know about public policy -- and calling an ordinary American ""misinformed"" for getting the exact same question ""wrong."" At the very least, these questions seem less clear-cut than asking who the vice president is. For this reason, we believe that this study should carry less weight in analyzing Stewart’s comment.

It appears the rationale for this is that Jon Stewart says misinformed rather than uninformed. Either way, isn't it understood that if you're uninformed, you're also to some degree misinformed out of ignorance or apathy? The validity of the study is not in question, and moreover does the writer skirt the point that there are news sources who do not have near the degree of an uninformed (or misinformed) audience. This isn't about measuring what Americans should and should not know versus elected officials, but a direct comparison of knowledge among news audiences. Since Politifact has no grounds to discredit the study's justification of whether the stimulus worked or not, the bottom-line is that many news outlet audiences faired better in answering the same exact question. 

Moreover this isn't relevant to the validity of the claim; this is an explanation for *why* they're uninformed or misinformed. That has little to no bearing in the scope of this claim.

This reasoning is also at odds with the reasoning drawn in the conclusion:

>So we have three Pew studies that superficially rank Fox viewers low on the well-informed list, but in several of the surveys, Fox isn’t the lowest, and other general-interest media outlets -- such as network news shows, network morning shows and even the other cable news networks -- often score similarly low. Meanwhile, particular Fox shows -- such as The O’Reilly Factor and Sean Hannity’s show -- actually score consistently well, occasionally even outpacing Stewart’s own audience.

The writer jumps back and forth in terms of whether the studies are considered valid and merit-worthy. 

The 2003 study, for example, dated though it may be, was effectively ignored in the final decision without granting a reason despite a direct acknowledgement of its validity and congruency with Jon's claim. As was the 2010 World Public Opinion report on semantical grounds circling around what it means to be misinformed:

>Meanwhile, the other set of knowledge surveys, from worldpublicopinion.org, offer mixed support for Stewart. The 2003 survey strikes us as pretty solid, but the 2010 survey has been critiqued for its methodology.

Politifact discredits the 2010 survey seemingly because there was a large reprisal from the right, but offered little depth to their casting the study out on grounds of methodology. 

>The way Stewart phrased the comment, it’s not enough to show a sliver of evidence that Fox News’ audience is ill-informed. The evidence needs to support the view that the data shows they are ""consistently"" misinformed -- a term he used not once but three times. It’s simply not true that ""every poll"" shows that result. So we rate his claim False.

Not a ""**sliver**"" of evidence? That seems awfully disingenuous. Moreover did the author fall victim just as much so as Jon with semantics, saying ""ill-informed"" rather than misinformed or uninformed. I could just as easily see a rational conclusion saying, 
""Jon's wording was somewhat overreaching, nevertheless in every open study conducted on the knowledge of news media outlets, FOX as a whole did rank low or last in certain instances. Given that Jon said misinformed rather than uninformed and that FOX did not always rank last, we rate this claim Half-True."" 

Finally, there have been other studies since then. A 2012 report indicates  that FOX viewers may be less informed than those who even subscribe to ""no news."" MSNBC fell below the ""No News"" category, as well:  http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/

Another published report out of Stanford in 2010 is titled, ""[Frequent Viewers of Fox News Are Less Likely to Accept Scientists' Views of Global Warming. **PDF**]( http://woods.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/files/Global-Warming-Fox-News.pdf)""


**Conclusion**


I contest that Politifact's own [rubric](http://www.politifact.com/about/) isn't in line with the evidence presented, here, and that the conclusion drawn is contradictory with the criticism throughout the article. [I'm also not the only one who disagrees.](http://mediamatters.org/research/2011/06/22/jon-stewart-gets-it-right-about-fox-news/180787#2). MediaMatters lists the chain-of-events and responses from other individuals, including the director of World Public Opinion, along with very studies and citations. 

**Politifact's Rubric:**

>Mostly True – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

>Half True – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

>Mostly False – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

>False – The statement is not accurate.

So while PolitiFact will unlikely change their verdict to Half-True or Mostly True, I want it to be very clear that the reality is FOX viewers as a whole are much less informed, if not misinformed from the general-public. Being sometimes at and often near the bottom of every list does not merit an outright discrediting of Stewart's claims. People should be aware that if you're looking for reliable news, you have to be selective. Fox is not a source for reliable, untinted, news.

Let me reiterate what was also mentioned in the article: that distinguishing what is an already-informed audience and an audience being informed by a news source is difficult to discern. Nonetheless with FOX, we can generally rule out they certainly are not accurate in informing their audience. It's likely those who score high in O'Reilly in the PEW study, for example, equate to the audience that scores highly with watching The Daily Show. 

I would say that this is not relevant anymore and ignore any evidence uncovered in the time after the claim was made—that is to say leave your verdict as it stands. However, this PolitiFact article is still linked to quite often (and referenced by Fox, themselves) and leads people to erroneously believe the contrary idea that, ""FOX is up there with the best of them.""—a false-equivalence notion. It's important people understand new evidence has come up. With something as complicated and nuanced as this, to represent the truth properly—an objective no good Journalist takes lightly—(and granting some slide with semantics), your truth-o-meter has to slide at least in the direction of the truth.  With that, I still urge PolitiFact to change the Truth-O-Meter verdict to Half-True if not Mostly-True. 

This is quite-frankly the end-all and an immense source of where division and partisanship stems from. Both MSNBC and Fox as well as others—though FOX moreso given its viewership—are largely doing Americans a disservice in being obligated to inform the citizenry. 

Depending on how narrow our acceptibility for precision is, many out there would just as easily agree with Politifact in that going by an exceptionally rigid standard, Stewart's claim is false; I likely won't convince these people of seeing the big picture, here. Nonetheless a claim that is justified is that there are much, much better news sources out there.

I took the time to write this because I think this is one of the most important, straight-forward facts people need to be aware of in order to get reasonable discussion going and increase focus on bigger issues rather than the false-equivalence partisanship narrative. Because of this, this topic is incredibly touchy and subject to casting out large sums of evidence on the grounds of political-bias. Time and again I reiterate the point that the truth and ignorance both often tend to have a bias, it's up to you to discern which is which. Whether it's politically-correct or not, I absolutely attribute our disengaged citizenry in the polito-sphere to mainstream and conservative news-outlets purporting to be on even-keel with the networks they themselves criticize.

To preface, this is NOT a question about whether he can get elected president, or if he can implement his policies as stated if he is elected. Rather, let's assume (for discussion) that his entire agenda is passed as stated.

Some of the policies, pulled from his website (https://berniesanders.com/issues/) are below. I've focused on the most specific items, particularly those with numbers.

**Energy/Green New Deal**

- 100% renewables (solar + wind)
- Pay $200 billion (per year?) towards addressing climate change

**College**

- Cancel $1.6 trillion in student loan debt
- Cap student loan interest at 1.88%
- $1.3 billion grant every year to historically black/minority colleges

**Workers/unions**

- Give employees at large companies 20% of company shares [1]
- Give employees at large companies 45% of board seats [1]
- Eliminate ""right to work"" laws for unionized companies
- Provide unions a majority sign up process to organize

**Social security/seniors**

- Lift payroll tax cap so income above $250k also subject to social security tax
- $1,300 increase in benefits for seniors with under $16k income
- No one must pay more than $200/year on pharmaceuticals

I've intentionally left off the Medicaire for All proposal, which has been discussed extensively elsewhere, to focus discussion on other parts of his agenda.

The only way this can change, he argues, is a political revolution in which democrats increase voter turnout by exciting the youth and disenfranchised working families and independents, expand the efforts now going on by Sanders supporters in for example /r/grassrootsselect and win back seats in the house, to in addition appointing judges to the supreme court who will ensure campaign finance reform.

A British cruiser and two British destroyers had closed in upon the harbour, and no doubt there were other warships not far away. The English newspapers gave it out that these ships were proceeding to Barcelona 'to protect British interests,' but in fact they made no move to do so; that is, they did not land any men or take off any refugees. There can be no certainty about this, but it was at least inherently likely that the British Government, which had not raised a finger to save the Spanish Government from Franco, would intervene quickly enough to save it from its own working class."" ibid pages 153-154*

*""Her book is valuable for a number of reasons, but especially because, unlike almost all English writers on Spain, she gives a fair deal to Spanish Anarchist. The Anarchists and Syndicalists have been persistently misrepresented in England, and the average English person still retains his eightneen-ninetyish notion that Anarchism is the same thing as anarchy. Anyone who wants to know what Spanish Anarchism stands for, and the remarkable things it achieved, especially in Catalonia, during the first two months of the revolution, should read chapter VII of Miss Mitchell's book."" ibid pages 290-1*

Often in popular discourse when one hears the term *Orwellian* thrown around it usually refers to the type of things he warned against in his novel *1984,* i.e. police-state surveillance, political duplicity, manipulations and obfucations of language, etc. Rarely, if ever, does it seem that we hear about the things Orwell was particularly for. In other words, emphasis on his work in the public discourse seems selective at times. What do you think?  

*""George Orwell is famous for Animal Farm and 1984, which focus on the official enemy, or could at least be interpreted in this light.

Many new arrivals to these states are liberals from the Northeast or the West or young people, which has caused traditional GOP strongholds like Arizona and even Texas to become more purple, and purple states like Virginia and New Mexico to become solidly liberal. Cities like Austin have become new hubs for technology and manufacturing.

The issue of climate change is one that is becoming increasingly noticeable though. A major story this week is the twin tropical storm/hurricane set to pummel the Gulf Coast, and wildfires becoming a major threat to large swaths of California (which is sometimes includes/sometimes excluded from the Sun Belt). Though these particular stories might still be considered outliers, it's all but certain that more extreme weather events like these will become more frequent as the climate heats up. The temperature itself stands to become increasingly uncomfortable in the already hot South, and sea level rises will threaten cities like Miami. Research on climate change also predicts that these effects will accelerate in the near future. Given that many Sun Belt states border Mexico, they will have to deal with climate migrants from Latin America on top of their already large undocumented immigrant populations.

Why he probably will be re-elected:

&#x200B;

\-  Since 1900, 20 presidents have run for reelection. The incumbents have won 15 times and lost five, if you include former President Gerald Ford who was never elected at the ballot box in the first place.  

\- The midterms are misleading us.  Bill Clinton’s party lost 52 House seats in 1994 and Barack Obama’s party lost 63 House seats in 2010, yet both men garnered more than 330 Electoral Votes in 1996 and 2012.

\- Electoral college playing field hasn't changed.  40 states are essentially already decided and 10 are up for grabs .

\- The economy is booming and will be for some time. Experts on the subject expect no economic recession before 2021.

&#x200B;

Why he probably will NOT be re-elected:

&#x200B;

\- President Donald Trump’s current unpopularity is unprecedented given the strength of the economy. 

\- People are turning on Donald Trump because of his style and awful decision making (shutdown, NATO, climate change...).

\- Turnout in the primaries was at an all time high. This might hurt Trump, as democrats are normally the ones that stay home the easiest.

\-  First-term incumbent presidents do have a weak spot — primary challenges. The last three times it happened, the incumbent president lost the general election. It looks like this might happen again.

Let's take a look at some issues and how I interpret them:

**More ""European"" than prior nominees**

Willingness to ignore the religious right and tolerate open the LGBT community is generally seen more in Western European conservatism than in its American counterpart, although Eastern Europe appears to be closer to the religious right.

Entitlements have always been a sticky subject, but Republicans generally have been more open to reform compared to Democrats. 

Trade and economic populism. The mainstream GOP has generally seen this as an extension of free market conservatism.

**Not more European**

Healthcare. Trump has been all over the map, but only one of his proposals  (his praise for single payer in some countries at some time periods) is outside the conservative mainstream, which includes everything from a thinly veiled reboot of Obamacare with just enough revisions to pass off as a repeal to a full reversion to the 2009 system, as far as I can tell. His disdain for regulations is an exaggeration of American conservative consensus in my opinion. 

Immigration and Islam, although both have been tolerated by the elites, have long been divisive issues on the right in my observation. Note that House Republicans sank their party's own immigration plan, and hard-core anti-Islam rhetoric, although sidelined, has been present in the US since at least the ground zero mosque controversy of 2010 and to some extent since September 12, 2001.

Worldview. Although I've seen him described as isolationist, Trump in general strikes me as someone who has a US vs everyone else worldview, emphasized in Detroit, and believes that the US should remain the #1 power in the world by any means necessary and who blames anti-American conspiracy theories for a lot of the US' problems. 

Iraq, admittedly. Trump's flip flopped, but so has much of the establishment (Jeb,  iirc, was pilloried for seemingly changing opinions 5 times in a week). Trump just seems to have the chutzpah to lie about it. Except on Russia, his foreign policy strikes me as pretty hawkish and even there he's threatened to shoot down Russian jets that are too close to US airspace. The hostility towards NATO appears driven by Machiavellianism, not inherent pacifism.

Global warming. His belief that it is an anti-American hoax puts him beyond the EU fringe and at the extreme end even of conservative climate skepticism.",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

This bill aims to extend a currently implemented tax credit for Carbon Capture & Storage from $10/$20 to $35/$50, where the lower value is for Enhanced Oil Recovery applications and the latter is for pure geological storage applications. This means that the government will pay large CO2 polluters for what they stick in the ground instead of in the air, with the goal of helping mitigate climate change.

Like the previous credit, it's expires after 70 million tons of CO2 have been claimed. This isn't a very large number - around 1.3 billion tons a year are generated from coal alone in the USA. So it wouldn't be possible for these credits to mitigate a very significant amount of CO2 emissions without being greatly extended. The intent is probably more to develop the technology.

It likely would still not be profitable for coal or gas plants to utilize CCS. But this could change in a few years, as some projections suggest a cost of [$20 per ton](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6318/1362.full) for a more advanced generation of CCS.

One notable aspect of the bill is that it has considerable bipartisan support; of the 25 sponsors 6 are Republicans. Since it potentially appeals to both climate change and coal interests it spans an interesting spectrum of Senators including John Barrasso and Sheldon Whitehouse.

So the question is, is this a positive step for climate policy, perhaps a better than nothing alternative to a carbon tax? Or could it ultimately be counter-productive?

Personally I'm torn. if it's cheap enough to be profitable it'll be pursued by what few coal (and maybe even gas) plants can. And even in an ideal world where fossil fuels are eventually phased out the technology can possibly have long term benefits as it can be used to sequester biomass as an energy source that actually reduces the amount of CO2 in the air. But I'm concerned that in the short term it could operate as a coal subsidy which ends up hurting the growth of other alternatives that are lower carbon than coal with CCS can be.",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

Public acceptance of anthropogenic climate change has been rising in polls in the last year as evidence of consequences and causation mount. Despite this, the threat indicators of climate change are unique and unprecedented and humans are not well adapted to proactively face this threat.

Some \*\*highlights\*\* of the consequences of climate change:

1) Continuous warming - increasing +0.2C per decade at current emission levels. 2015-2018 are the 4 hottest years on record. 

2) More Extreme evaporation (drought/fire/agri losses) and precipitation (flooding) cycles. 

3) More extreme weather  - Arctic warming is proceeding 2-3x faster than the rest of the globe and causing weakening of the jet stream in the N. Hemisphere. Also, the Gulfstream which transfers heat from the equator to the N. Atlantic region is slowing. 

4) Sea level rise (SLR) - The oceans are expanding as they heat up and polar ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. 

For purposes of projecting inflection points in the future, SLR seems to be the variable which will become most able to be predictable in the future. Tremendous investment in satellite based technology and ocean sensors is proving an increasingly granular understanding of the factors influencing SLR.  

The gold standard of scientific consensus on climate change comes from the IPCC.  However, since the IPCC's most recent reports are based upon 5-6 year old science, I would direct any interested parties to check out the US National Climate Assessment of 2017 linked here for the best and most recent consensus.

Most of the losses have been concentrated in Louisiana which has had several 500 year floods in the last decade. 

In the next year or two, insurance underwriters will be converting to maps which incorporate projections of sea level rise and a domino effect will impact coastal real estate and financial markets. As flood insurance rates increase, coastal and other flood prone real estate values will be impacted. This will impact municipalities who are dependent upon property tax revenue at the same time they will be at risk of credit downgrades (from agencies like S&P and Moody's) and increasing adaptation and mitigation costs. 

The financial meltdown will precede the inundation when the science is solid enough to give a reasonable prediction of the timing of future SLR. My hunch is that a correction an order of magnitude larger than the '07 crisis could come by the early 2030's and result in widespread municipal bankruptcy.  

At some point along the way, the requisite response to the climate crisis is going to necessitate a transformation of our govt's approach to the problem and governance approach in general. So much of the energy of the political subs here on reddit seems to be on short-term transactional politics and I thought it might be interesting and useful to discuss how politics is going to be impacted by the transformation of the earth's climate system.

The platform draft includes language emphasizing issues such as climate change (though it remains silent on the Biden proposal to ban new fracking leases on public lands) & police brutality (supporting ""lowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations"" & ""reining in the doctrine of qualified immunity,"" which protects police officers from civil litigation), as well as a new proposal for a national commission to study slavery reparations & the lasting effects of other forms of institutionalized racism. It also opposes ""regime change"" & proposes ""less"" spending on national defense.

If so, do you think this is right or should we change this and what do you think would happen with Europe if the US took an isolationist stance and closed down military bases outside the US in order to fund some of the social programs that are being discussed? 

Some context:  I'm a futurist with libertarian leanings ( meaning I think that technology will solve most of the problems that we're trying to solve with politics) , but I'm also a pragmatist. I take the stance that we should stop interfering in the business of other countries, but I also don't wan to see Europe burn to the ground and pull us into another war. Given the instability in the area I'm not sure that this is the best course of action.   I feel that as we approach a world with 100% automation we're going to come up against some hard questions and have to make real cuts somewhere in order to prevent implosion, and this is one way we could effectively cut military budget, but it feels like it's not a realist position to take.  

I realize it's a political nonstarter in our current climate, but there are some economists saying a deflationary cycle may ( or already is beginning to) come in the next 5-10 years which could put enough pain to cause a real change of course.

First past the post voting did not prevent a third party from gaining the Presidency in 1860, triggering the most dramatic shakeup of our political system in the nations history.

The people who benefit the most from first past the post voting (the two major parties) have the least incentive to change it.  The changes they do make (like California's jungle primary system), only further entrench the power of the major parties.  Voting for the two party system is a message to the parties that people are content with their current platforms, and no major changes are needed.  Not voting tells the parties that you are not politically engaged enough to threaten their control, and your political opinions can be safely ignored.  However, even an unsuccessful third party campaign can shift the priorities of the major parties, in an attempt to capture the votes of disaffected voters who are still willing to go to the polls.

Bush's failure to uphold his ""read my lips, no new taxes"" pledge led to the insurgent candidacy of Ross Perot.  Perot ultimately failed, but today's GOP has largely adopted much of his platform, and their opposition to new taxes is as high as it has ever been.

Nader's campaign in 2000 ended up pushing many Democrats to more openly embrace environmental issues, even Al Gore himself has become keenly focused on trumpeting the warning signs on climate change and helping make it into a mainstream plank of the Democratic party.

Among the different positions [not all mutually exclusive or exhaustive] there seem to be the following positions:

* Global Warming isn't even occurring
* It's occurring, but it isn't caused by human activity
* It's occurring, but the impact on humans will be negligible
* It's occurring, but the costs of preventing the problems are much greater than the costs of the impact
* It's occurring, but the free market will solve it
* It's occurring, but there are no politically feasible ways to prevent the future impacts due to international-political dynamics
* It's occurring, and appropriate way of mitigating it is ... X
* ... Y 
* ... Z

There are obviously interest groups that benefit more from not changing course than others, and I suspect some of those that benefit from the status quo intentionally jump around between the first few to confound and prevent the debate between the last few positions. Is there any chance we can nip it in the bud and change it to a discussion between the last options, starting with ""it's too expensive to prevent"" -- which to me, on the spectrum, is the first stage of reasonable argument a ""climate skeptic"" can make.

We know it's happening and almost certainly caused by human activity. We don't know for a fact what the impacts will be, but we have decent statistical models that give a range of possibilities, some impacts are more clear than others. At what point can the debate shift to what harm reduction policies/treaties can and should we enact that reflect the probable impacts?

I work in ""collateral risk management"" and we are certainly looking at the impacts of climate change on collateral risk. When the US military was asked to look into it, they produced similar risk impact analyses and proposals to handle the potential problems caused by localized political and economic destabilization, mass migration, infrastructure degradation, etc.

Which of the above positions are even legitimate? What preemptive solutions are feasible? What reactive solutions will be feasible in the most likely scenarios given by the accepted climate change models? How long will it take for the reactive solutions to be recognized as necessary [e.g. people stop rebuilding where they shouldn't, shifting agricultural practices on a matching pace versus failing for several years before recognizing that the existing practices aren't optimal for the new climate, etc.].",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

**Background on the Election** [""Gambian Opposition Unites"".](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/gambia/2016-11-25/gambias-opposition-unites)

> On December 1, Gambians will vote in their country’s most consequential election since it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. For the first time, a unified political coalition will challenge Yahya Jammeh, Gambia’s longtime dictator, only months after the most vigorous protest movement in the country’s recent history.
> 
> The upcoming election could usher in a new period in Gambia’s political development, which so far has been marked by two distinct phases. The first period began in 1965 with Gambian independence and ended in 1994 with the overthrow of Dawda Jawara, the country’s first popularly elected president. Over those three decades, Gambia’s economy performed relatively well compared to its counterparts in West Africa, ranking third overall in GDP per capita in 1994; the country also became a popular tourist destination, earning the moniker the “Smiling Coast of Africa.” Jawara was widely applauded for advancing human rights and for his bold attempts to improve Gambia’s economy. Thanks in part to his government’s record, in 1989, the newly created African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) chose to establish its secretariat in Banjul, Gambia’s capital. 
> 
> In the early 1990s, Jawara began to face growing internal criticism and calls for change—in particular, for failing to curb corruption and provide basic services. Throughout the early 1990s, civil society groups, university students, and working Gambians took to the streets to express their discontent. Yet Gambia was hardly an outlier in a region that was experiencing a host of post-colonial troubles. 
> 
> **Gambia’s situation took a dramatic turn for the worse in July 1994, when Jammeh, then a 29-year-old junior military officer, seized power in a bloodless coup.** (He had recently returned from a military training course in the United States.) **Under Jammeh’s rule, which marks the second period in Gambia’s independent political history, the country has earned a reputation as a human rights pariah due to the rampant killings, disappearances, and torture of journalists, activists, and members of the political opposition.** Gambia is now the only country in West Africa with a per-capita GDP that is lower today than it was in 1994, and it has the region’s second-lowest per-capita GDP in the region overall. It’s no wonder that Gambia’s most notable export is its own citizens. **This year, they made up the fourth-largest group of migrant and refugee arrivals to Italy, despite the fact that Gambia has one of the smallest populations in Africa.** Perhaps in an attempt to shield himself and his regime from potential prosecution for their myriad crimes, Jammeh recently withdrew Gambia from the International Criminal Court. (The chief prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, is a Gambian citizen and was once a legal adviser to Jammeh.) As for the ACHPR, African observers have called for its relocation to a country with a better human rights record.
> 
> 
> **Since 1994, Jammeh has systematically deprived ordinary citizens of their rights to free speech and has verbally lashed out against most segments of society, threatening, for instance, to “slit the throats” of gay men living in the country and vowing to “bury” the political opposition “nine feet deep.”** But Gambians are not the only targets of Jammeh’s unhinged ire: in May, for instance,  **he told U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and Amnesty International to “go to hell” after Ban and Amnesty voiced their concerns about the death of Solo Sandeng, an opposition youth leader who was arrested, beaten, and reportedly tortured to death while in state custody.**
> 
> In the run-up to the December 1 election, Jammeh and his inner circle have ratcheted up their incendiary rhetoric, which has at times amounted to hate speech and incitement to violence. **In June, Jammeh labeled the country’s nearly one million ethnic Mandinka “vermin” and went on to exclaim: “I will kill you like ants, and nothing will come out of it.” Soon afterward, Gambia’s top diplomat at the United Nations was caught on tape endorsing the shooting of peaceful protesters.** And in the second week of November, the government arrested and detained incommunicado three Gambian journalists (one has since been released). 
> 
> **In recent months, however, there have been signs that Gambia’s climate of fear is beginning to dissipate. In April, Gambians took to the streets in the most sustained act of public defiance against Jammeh since he seized power over two decades ago.** The authorities suppressed the burgeoning civic movement with characteristic brutality, arresting more than 90 opposition activists and handing down three-year jail sentences to 30 people, including the president of Gambia’s main opposition party. The crackdown led to the deaths, apparently by torture, of at least two opposition party supporters held in state custody.
> 
> Instead of withdrawing into their corners, **in October, Gambia’s opposition united behind a single presidential candidate**, a businessman and former London security guard named **Adama Barrow.** 
>
>**The impressive union backing Barrow includes most of Gambia’s main opposition parties and has drawn the support of Isatou Touray, a prominent human rights activist** who has been at the forefront of efforts to achieve social change in the country for several decades.

&#x200B;

[Citizens Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) (CCL) has been working since 2007 with the goal of getting legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties interested in taking measures against climate change.  Their focus has been on gaining support and proposing  a revenue neutral carbon tax, or carbon fee and dividend.  Economists praise this plan which would involve setting an initial price on carbon emissions and increasing that price year after year with the revenue being given back to American households.  A border adjustment tax is included which would drive the rest of the world to ensure that U.S. manufacturing does not become uncompetitive.  The CCL believes that this bill would cut emissions by at least 40% within 12 years.  A compromise in this bill involves [forbidding the EPA from imposing additional regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for 10 years](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/how-does-the-new-carbon-pricing-bill-stack-up/), so if we go this route, it really needs to work.  The group has had many successes including getting 90 Representatives (45 D, 45 R) to join the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus and actually proposing a bill on the floor of the House in the form of the [Energy Innovation and Dividend Act](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act/).  It has not been all roses for the CCL, however, as several of their prominent members including Rep. Carlos Curbelo lost their seats in 2018's Blue Wave election.

&#x200B;

The [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/) is a group of mostly young activists hoping to push the Democratic Party to support a Green New Deal.  What that deal includes is nebulous at the moment, but it is clear that this would produce more sweeping changes in American society than simply imposing a carbon tax.  The [Green New Deal](https://www.dataforprogress.org/green-new-deal/) would get America off fossil fuels entirely by 2050 and lead to an end of new fossil fueled vehicles by 2030 and fossil fuel generated electricity by 2035 among other goals.  This would be combined with a Green Jobs Guarantee to provide the manpower to meet these goals.  Advocates of the Green New Deal see this as the only approach that meets the level of response suggested in the recent IPCC report to keep warming below 2°C. The Sunrise Movement rose to prominence by staging a protest in Nancy Pelosi's office after the midterm election and had another ""occupation"" of the Capitol on December 10th, 2018.  Their tactics have been successful so far as they have convinced 37 Congresspeople (all Democrats) to date to support the creation of a Green New Deal select committee.  This committee would formulate a Green New Deal bill which would ideally be ready to go as soon as the newly captured Senate and newly elected Democratic President come into power in 2021.  That's the thing, this plan relies on a complete Democratic takeover of Washington in the 2020 election.  It is also likely that this plan would involve revenue positive carbon taxes to pay for it's potentially high expenses, making it incompatible with the CCL plan.

135,On the recent self-flagellation in r/politics for poor reddiquette.  ,31.0,j56c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/j56c9/on_the_recent_selfflagellation_in_rpolitics_for/,68.0,1312154985.0,"There has been a spate of posts here recently on how conservatives and dissenters are being downvoted in r/politics comments, leading to groupthink.  While reddiquette demands we upvote comments which contribute to the discussion, and downvote those that do not, it does not mean that all deeply-felt comments contribute to a discussion. 

I routinely and without apology downvote the blatant white supremacists, for example.  They are idiots and we know better; it does not help a discussion to refute their absurd claims every time someone posts an article vaguely about race.  I also downvote the 10th grade emo-anarchist comments that we should ""smash the state.""  Positions which are so poorly considered are merely a distraction; they do not contribute to a discussion.  

So where does that leave some of the supposedly censored conservative comments?  I will also downvote, in most conversations, the idea that any tax on the rich is theft, as one commentator recently claimed in a downvoted r/politics post held up as an example of censorship.  These are not intelligent positions, no more than the emo-anarchist view is.  The only difference is that some people have been elected with that same absurd platform. While such poorly considered views deserve to be refuted, bringing them up repeatedly does not further an intelligent discussion of tax policy.  

I would also downvote comments based on erroneous facts.  While there is some value to refuting common misconceptions, there is little value in doing so repeatedly with people who see disconfirming sources as a conspiracy.  This includes homeopaths who see double blind tests as evil, truthers who see actual analysis as manipulated (except their own freeze frames of youtube clips), and some conservative commentators on climate change who believe the Rush Limbaugh is better climate scientist than thousands of actual scientists.  We have to deal with reality to have a meaningful discussion.  Comments which don't deal with reality don't contribute to a discussion.  

So no, I don't support downvoting comments I disagree with.  But I also have no qualms downvoting comments which don't contribute to a meaningful discussion.  This may include comments which are in line with major conservative movements; merely because Ron Paul says something does not mean it needs to be refuted in every discussion.  It is okay to downvote things which add nothing, even if they have support from a senator.   

tl;dr, It is still okay to downvote comments which do not contribute to a meaningful discussion.",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

* The sources see Harris as a promising choice for attorney general if she's not on the ticket.

**Treasury Secretary**: 

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren as Treasury secretary could help unite the party.
* Jamie Dimon — chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and mentioned over the years as a potential presidential candidate — would also be considered for Treasury.
* Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America, is another possibility for Treasury.


**State**
* Tony Blinken, deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser under Obama, could go to State or become national security adviser.

* Susan Rice, formerly President Obama's national security adviser, is another option for State.

* John Kerry would love to take a new Cabinet position devoted to climate change, or might even accept a curtain call to return as secretary of state.

**Diplomacy related**
* Biden advisers expect Pete Buttigieg to get a prominent slot after his swift endorsement of Biden — perhaps as ambassador to the UN, or as U.S. trade representative. Both would help credential Buttigieg for a future national campaign.  

* Mike Bloomberg, who swiftly endorsed Biden after the former mayor's campaign collapsed, would be a top possibility to head the World Bank.

**Defense related**

* Michèle Flournoy, an Obama undersecretary of defense, would be the favorite to run Biden's Pentagon.

* Tom Donilon, national security adviser under Obama, would be considered for CIA director, director of national intelligence, or secretary of state.

**Commerce related**

141,What forms your political views?,32.0,4mfwki,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4mfwki/what_forms_your_political_views/,123.0,1464999722.0,"Maybe I'm showing my age, but in pre-internet days I spent years asking people a simple question ""What is the difference between a Republican and a Democrat?"" I actually wanted to know, but no one really had any good answers. I'm not sure if that has changed much.

Now-a-days I hear more people say ""They all want the same thing anyway, you have to vote for the better candidate."" which seems to be based mostly on debates and ""views."" Okay, so now we're getting somewhere...

Per my observations by now, for many people, I think my new question would be ""What is the difference between a Liberal and a Conservative?"", and actually this seems to be a bit easier to define. At least you can get a finite list of viewpoints that tend to separate these two political types. Usually regarding issues such as:

* Abortion
* Dealth Penalty
* State vs Religion
* Guns
* Big Gov / Small Gov
* Education
* Healthcare
* Immigration

etc. Probably many more topics. These are mostly from a list online and I think it is accurate via my other personal surveys.

But I am afraid that people tend to ""choose teams"" and lose a bit of themselves in the midst of this ""Liberal vs Conservative"" debate. What if I am pro-life (conservative) but also against guns (liberal)? Maybe I am a ""climate denier"" (conservative) and also supportive of socialized healthcare (liberal). Isn't that actually normal? Why would any two people have exactly all the same views on such a variety of topics?

Perhaps even more extreme, maybe I think none of these issues matter and we should be talking about something else!

So, this might be difficult now that the rage of this election season seems to be in full heat (and what a wacky election season it is!) but if you can think down to the core, what views do you think really helped define your political views? Regardless if you take these matters to heart or are just having sport.

I'll answer myself with these.

* I think it is too hard to open a small company in the US. (keyword: 'company' not freelancer or personal business.) Too much bureaucracy.
* I believe in euthanasia, for suffering people. No one should have to live in pain when death is inevitable.
* Prisoners should be ""understood and treated"", not abused. And most of them should be freed at this point. No prison should ever be a capitalizing business.
* Education is a lifetime practice, not a short distance sprint race to the finish. Stop any practices which suggest otherwise.
* Stop letting the rich get away with murder. This is not a cast society.
* Anti-corruption. We have checks and balances, but they need some reinforcement, or at least an upgrade or something? This is clearly not a level playing field.

There is much more, but these tend to be my core concerns which the government interferes with.

Now its your turn if you will? What types of things make your political views at heart?! Do you even care about what they talk about these days? If yes, which issues strike heart?

143,Are citizen's assemblies effective at better representing the people?,27.0,ddijh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ddijh6/are_citizens_assemblies_effective_at_better/,35.0,1570249734.0,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly

The idea behind citizen's assemblies is to shrink the gap between representive and citizen interests. A random or semirandom group of citizens are selected to form an assembly. This assembly would be briefed by a group of people knowledgeable on whatever topic they're focusing on. The assembly discusses possible policy changes to address the issue over several meetings, and once they reach a conclusion they typically submit their proposal as a referendum. If the referendum is approved by the general public, it had a chance of becoming law.

This has already been experimented with in some European countries and in Canada. Supporters say assemblies have proven to be effective in enacting change faster and more efficiently than traditional government, with many citing the 2012 Irish assembly as successfully repealing a constitutional ban on abortions and legalizing gay marriage. Some have notably proposed it as a solution to government inaction against climate change. Critics dispute their effectiveness by arguing potential pitfalls such as biased assemblies,  and weakness. [The same Irish assembly from before has been used as an example of this.](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-myth-of-the-citizens-assembly-democracy/) Most of its proposals were not approved by either the public or the government. Other examples of failure include Canadian and Dutch attempts at electoral reform.

So would citizen's assemblies be an effective way of better representing the people? If it is, how should it be executed? Should its members be completely random or adjusted to reflect all demographics equally? Should the briefing only include experts or should it also include other views, like a pastor against same sex marriage? What if the assembly arrives at a ""wrong"" consensus? (Eg.

However, addressing climate change head-on seems extremely difficult. There's a collective action problem: while each country would benefit if all other countries took steps to address climate emissions, no individual country has much of an incentive to take these steps. In addition, solutions to reduce carbon emissions directly (e.g., carbon taxes) are usually politically unpopular. Thus, it's difficult to be optimistic that global warming will be significantly curtailed.

This leads me to a series of interrelated questions:

* Are there politically workable ways to significantly reduce the rate of climate change?

For the past few months, Senate Democratic Leadership and the White House have been involved in closed door negotiations with Manchin to revive BBB, which he nixed last winter. The new BBB proposal would reduce climate and renewable energy spending to $300 billion instead of $500 billion, reductions in social programs spending, and generating $1T of revenues through prescription drug reform and tax increases resulting in net total spending of $1T, a reduction of $0.75T from its previous iteration.

A week ago, The Atlantic ([https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/07/democrats-manchin-schumer-biden-deal-build-back-better-bill/661512/](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/07/democrats-manchin-schumer-biden-deal-build-back-better-bill/661512/)) reported hopeful progress being made on this iteration of BBB, which still contained major climate reforms that fulfill a major Biden and Democratic Party agenda item.

Just yesterday, however, Manchin withdrew support on climate and tax regulations, promising only to support prescription drug reform and a two-year extension of ACA subsidies to combat insurance premium hikes out of concerns over current high levels of inflation and a looming recession.

One final factor to consider is the semiconductor chip manufacturing subsidy bill that is still underway in the Senate, which can further clog the Senate agenda and was recently threatened by Mitch McConnell should Democrats pass a party-line reconciliation bill.

Therefore,

1. Is climate reform truly dead now? Things looked especially bleak last winter, but long-shot hopes of the bill's revival through closed door meetings turned out to be well-founded as recently as last week - until yesterday.
2. Are Manchin's arguments well-founded? Would clean energy investments and a lack of investments in oil & gas production contribute to further gas increases - and should this be a more pertinent issue for regular households than the threat of climate change? Additionally, new spending would undoubtedly contribute to inflation, and there are no guarantees even prescription drug pricing reforms would match households' wealth slashes from inflation and price hikes.
3. Should Democrats accept this version of BBB without climate or tax reform? There is the old adage that progressives should take whatever Manchin offers, but with the absence of climate change reforms, has the bill truly become so watered down that it is unpassable? What conditions would create a scenario for Democrats to pass this version of BBB? I can envision a dark winter 2022 following severe midterm losses for Democrats to provide sufficient momentum to pass a watered down BBB with only prescription drug reform and short-term ACA subsidies, if only because it would be the last tangible social spending they can act on with their majority before the end of the lame-duck period.

In reality though, I'm not sure if this is entirely true. Hillary may be more effective than Sanders as a President, but I think it's debatable by how much that will be. Hillary has listed many, many policy changes she wants to chase and it's highly unlikely that she will be able to push through all of them. Most people who vote fail to realize that the Presidency is a limited position. Political capital available to the US President is not limitless. So while she may be able to push through a few issues she focuses on, I highly doubt a majority of the topics her platforms touch upon will see any major changes during her Presidency. 

With that being said, what issues do you think President Hillary will choose to push?

I personally see her continuing to push forward imrpovements for Obamacare and champion social issues, specifically for women, children, and minorities. To me, the theme of her life's work has been to work with children and women in disadvantaged communities and I believe we'll continue seeing that during her Presidency.

Another thing she'll probably try to push for is campaign finance reform, not through legislative means but by Supreme Court appointments. Regardless of whether you believe Hillary is ""in bed"" with corporations or not, campaign finance reform benefits Democrats politically. It's a win-win for her since the actual passage benefits her party (IIRC, there's more GOP money than Dem money.) while her working for it can continue to energize the youth vote energized by Sanders to affect down-ballot elections. 

One thing I do not see her do, is push strongly for gun control.  Unless the political climate changes significantly, it's a losing issue for Dems. She's too calculating to push for it.

155,Do you know the science of global warming? (Bored with gov shutdown),18.0,1od0ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1od0ig/do_you_know_the_science_of_global_warming_bored/,64.0,1381681685.0,"The conversation online is always mired in petty disagreement and squabbling over peripheral and minor issues. 

My hope is to discuss and inform those who read this while transcending the small minded finger-pointing. I want to talk about the most important of all issues: the future of our species due to climate change.

Let me present the issue in a thorough yet concise manner.

All animals and most organisms get their energy from the sun indirectly. Plants do photosynthesis and create chemical energy, which is consumed by heterotrophs. Millions of years ago many of these animals and plants died and decomposed in an anaerobic environment (without oxygen) and their stored energy was converted into what we call fossil fuels. This ancient energy is in contrast to contemporary solar energy, which is the sun that hits the earth today and is stored in trees (wood).

When any organic energy is broken down for energy (whether contemporary or ancient) it emits co2 and other gases. For example, We exhale co2 because we break down contemporary carbohydrate energy from plants. When wood burns, co2 is released in the same way as a byproduct of releasing the stored energy.

All breakdown of contemporary carbon energy is part of something called the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is a natural component of the earth's ecology. Carbon moves from organism to the atmosphere to the ocean back to organisms (in photosynthesis). 
Organisms use carbon primarily as a chemical energy source in the form of carbohydrates, lipids, and ATP. 
The atmospheric co2 acts as a greenhouse gas absorbing the solar energy of the sun and keeping it near the surface of our planet, in turn keeping our water liquid and planet hospitable. Atmospheric co2 also acts as the life blood of our photosynthetic organisms.

Throughout human history we have always used contemporary solar energy to create heat and energy by burning wood. In the last hundred years we began using ancient energy (coal, gas, and oil) to generate heat and energy as well as many commodities. This lead to a population boom and the technologically advanced society we now live in.

Like I said earlier, ancient fossil carbon energy is also a product of our sun and a part of the carbon cycle. However, there is a reason it is ancient, because the earth does not naturally recycle fossil fuels. The earths ecological cycles only use and recycle contemporary solar energy. It is important to keep in mind that when fossil fuels burn, the combustion reaction is releasing co2 that was stored millions of years ago. This is ancient co2 NOT co2 that is part of the contemporary carbon cycle.

In addition, we don't just burn a few tons of ancient energy. We burn millions of tons every year, releasing billions of tons of ancient co2 in excess of the natural contemporary co2 released. Simultaneously we are deforesting and minimizing the ways our planet can deal with this extra influx of co2 (and other greenhouse gases).

If the extra greenhouse gases we are creating since the industrial revolution are not stored they will exist in the atmosphere or ocean. 
In the ocean they dissolve and contribute to something called ocean acidification. This acidification changes the chemical landscape of the largest biome on earth making it inhospitable to many organisms. 
In the atmosphere they increase our planets natural greenhouse effect. 

I could go on about the effects of this increase and possible solutions to the potential issues that will arise in the nearing future but I leave that to you. 

My motivation here is to point out in one of the most politically torn areas of the internet, that science is apolitical. The science of climate is no exception. All of the things I've explained here are basic ecological facts. I challenged you redditors to expand on this scientific foundation by debating (in a civilized manner) what the implications are of this reality on society and politics.

158,Strauss-Howe Generational Theory and its Implications for the Election,21.0,2t9hd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2t9hd6/strausshowe_generational_theory_and_its/,35.0,1421906868.0,"For those of you unfamiliar with [Strauss-Howe Generational Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory), I will provide a ""brief"" description below.  If you know about it, feel free to skip to my analysis beneath that.

> William Strauss and Neil Howe wrote a series of books in the 1990s that analyzed history in a new way: cyclically, rather than in a linear fashion.

> As far back as the 1400s, there have been four stages that society continues to pass through.  They call these stages ""turnings"".  Each turning lasts about 20 years (give or take), and the whole cycle lasts a bit over 80 years - the course of a long human lifetime.

> The 1st Turning is a ""**High**"".  In this period, institutions are strong and individualism is weak.  People work together, and the sense of community is strong, but spiritual depth and diversity are somewhat muted.  The most recent 1st Turning we experienced was ""Superpower America"", the post-war boom of 1943-1960.

> The 2nd Turning is an ""**Awakening**"".  Children who grew up during the high are now becoming young adults, and they feel disenchanted with what they see as a superficial and oppressive system.  They rebel against the government, against institutions, and against their parents, and fight for individual expression and freedom from control.  The most recent Awakening was the ""Consciousness Revolution"" of 1961-1980.

> The 3rd Turning is an ""**Unraveling**"".  Due to the efforts of young adults during the Awakening period, institutions are now weak and individualism is high.  ""Every man for himself"" is the motto.  Individual identity is strong, but cultural identity and a sense of community are weak.  The most recent 3rd Turning was the ""Culture Wars"" (Dems. versus Reps.) and ""Postmodernism"" from 1982-2004.

> The 4th Turning is a ""**Crisis**"".  This is when the problems of the 3rd Turning come to a head, and people start to band together to overcome them.  They tear down old, decaying institutions and start rebuilding them.  They band together to fix their problems.  This leads to the ""High"" of the next 1st Turning.  The most recent 4th Turning was the Great Depression and World War II from 1925-1942.  Before that, it was the Civil War (1843-1865), and before that it was the American Revolution (1767–1791).  Like I said, these cycles can be traced all the way back to the 1400s, so click through to the Wiki link above to see more about how our history falls into this pattern.

> Strauss and Howe predicted in 1997 that the next 4th Turning - the crisis-  would begin with a spark somewhere around 2005, give or take a few years.  Quote from their book: ""**In retrospect, the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash, as ordinary as a national election, or as trivial as a Tea Party.** The catalyst will unfold according to a basic Crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios: An initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies.""  Eerily prescient, no?

> The other thing to understand about this theory is that history not only goes in cycles, but so do generational attitudes.  The events that happen during a generation's childhood, young adulthood, midlife, and elderhood affect how that generation views the world, how it views themselves, and how it views people from other generations.  There are four generational archetypes which coincide with which Turning they came of age.

> * The **Hero** archetype is born during an Unraveling and comes of age during a Crisis.  They tend to be civic-minded, optimistic, and collectivist.  The most recent Hero generations were the G.I. generation (born 1901-1924 and fought in WWII) and the current crop of Millenials (b. 1982-2004).
> * The **Artist** archetype is born during a Crisis and comes of Age during a High.  They tend to be well-socialized, conformist, and process-oriented.  Basically, they tend to work hard and do what is expected of them.  The most recent Artist generation was the Silent Generation (b. 1925-1942).  Don Draper, Joan Holloway, and Pete Campbell from Mad Men represent this generation well.
> * The **Prophet** archetype is born during a High and comes of age during an Awakening.  They have no memory of the Crisis period that led to the high.  They tend to be idealistic, moralistic, and socially fractured.  The current coming of the Prophet archetype are Baby Boomers (b. 1943-1960).
> * The **Nomad** archetype is born during an Awakening and comes of age during a Crisis.  They were generally left alone and ignored during their childhood, and don't have any memories of a ""High"" period when everyone got along.  They tend to be alienated, survivalist, and pragmatic.  The current Nomad generation is Generation X (b. 1961-1981).

Alright, still with me?  If so, here is how I envision the current political landscape:

We are in a period of Crisis (the financial crisis, potentially with a looming total war or other great challenge that we haven't yet predicted in the next decade).  The crisis stemmed mainly from the individualist, anti-regulation (""You can't tell me what to do!"") policies enacted by the Baby Boomers in the 80s when they came into power, and that have continued to today.  The fractured infighting of liberals vs. conservatives is very typical of a Prophet generation.

This is not the first time it's happened.  In the previous Crisis (Great Depression & World War II), it was the over-speculation of the previous Prophet generation (Missionary Generation b. 1860–1882) and their moralistic and socially divisive policies (Prohibition, reconstruction after World War I) that lead to the Crisis.  The trend continues backward.

The current Nomad generation (Gen X) has felt alienated and disillusioned by the lack of societal support, but they are starting to come into their own as midlife leaders.  Obama is one of the oldest Gen Xers around.  Nomad generals (Patton, Eisenhower) led Hero soldiers in World War II - their practicality and grit gives realistic and useful guidance to the optimistic and energetic young Hero generations.

So here's my question - in the upcoming election, what *kind* of leader do we need to see us through this crisis?  Obviously, any Millenials are too Young, and with John McCain's defeat it seems we will never have a Silent Generation president.  So - if we go off historial precedent, do we want a president who is a:

* **Baby Boomer?** (Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Hillary Clinton, Andrew Cuomo, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Elizabeth Warren, Jim Webb)

* or **Gen X**? (Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Martin O'Malley, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker)

* or do we give an old but hardworking **Silent Generation** candidate (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders) a shot?

Do we cling to the ideals of the Prophet generation, or the pragmatism of the Nomad generation?

Let's look at who led the Anglo-American society through past Crises for an idea.

1. **Crisis: War of the Roses**, 1461-1482

    Leaders: Edward IV (Hero), Henry VI (Nomad), Edward IV again

    Result: The Tudor Renaissance 

2. **Crisis: Armada Crisis**, 1566-1587

    Leader: Elizabeth I (Nomad)

    Result: Merrie England

3. **Crisis: King Philip's War & the Glorious Revolution**, 1674–1700

    Leaders: Charles II (Nomad), James II (Nomad), Mary II (Hero), William III (Hero)

    Result: The Augustan Age of Empire

4. **Crisis: American Revolution**, 1767–1791

    Leaders: England: George III (Nomad), George Washington (Nomad)

    Result: The Era of Good Feeling

5. **Crisis: American Civil War**, 1843–1865

    Leaders: John Tyler (Artist), James K. Polk (Prophet), Zachary Taylor (Artist), Millard Fillmore (Prophet), Franklin Pierce (Prophet), James Buchanan (Artist), Abraham Lincoln (Prophet)

    Result: It is argued that this Crisis came too early and ended up scarring children during this time instead of empowering them.  That said, this seems to be a fault of leaders during what should have been the unraveling period (all listed above except Lincoln).  We were robbed of a Hero generation, but the end result of the war was the Reconstruction & The Gilded Age

6. **Crisis: The Great Depression & World War II**, 1925–1942

    Leaders: US: Calvin Coolidge (Prophet), Herbert Hoover (Prophet), Franklin D. Roosevelt (cusp of Prophet and Nomad); UK: Stanley Baldwin(Prophet), Ramsay MacDonald (Prophet), Neville Chamberlain (Prophet), Winston Churchill (Prophet)
    Result: Superpower America

7. **Crisis: The Great Recession, Climate Change, The War on Terror**, 2005–present

    Leaders: US: George W. Bush (Prophet), Barack Obama (cusp of Prophet and Nomad), ???; UK: Tony Blair (Prophet), Gordon Brown (Prophet), David Cameron (Nomad), ???

    Result: ???

I was hoping to come out of all this work with more to show, but all I seemed to have found was that people come into power older now than they used to lol.  Judging by the Civil War mess I do think we should stay away from Artists, though, so goodbye Biden and Sanders (as if they had a shot...).

Is there anything else you can pull out of this data?

## What are Bernie Bros?

The term ""Bernie Bro"" caricatures a typical white male Bernie supporter as someone who ""only cares"" about economic issues, marijuana legalization, free college, net neutrality, and perhaps climate change. He is unreceptive or dismissive of concerns about sexism and racism, saying that ""#AllLivesMatter"" or that ""We need to fight for women's rights and men's rights."" The BernieBro can't explain how a financial transaction tax wouldn't lead to capital flight, but he has a binder full of statisics on why the pay gap is a myth. 

Above all, the Bernie Bro is abstractly in favor of a woman President ""someday,"" but not the undeniably first viable female candidate for the office staring him right in the face.

Basically the idea is the BernieBro is receptive to only the liberal concerns that affect him or people who look like him. This is held to be a terrible, terrible thing. The BernieBro is a ""bad ally"" who ""mansplains"" away any concern that doesn't touch his life.
 
##My question is, suppose BernieBros exist. What's the problem?

**Liberalism is a coalition** of people with different interests. Just like a potluck dinner, you might bring one issue you're really passionate about. You might discover something someone else brought and decide you love it and want to add it to your plate. And yes, you might be actively hostile to something someone else brought and decide after one taste it isn't for you.

Not all liberals are liberalism's ally on every issue. It's an open  secret that opposition to gay marriage *within the Democratic Party establishment* was for years driven by the fear that older voters of color would not turn out for a pro-gay candidate. Yet if I ran around blogging petulantly about older **""Black Bible Bots""** who keep ""Christsplaining"" to gays, I would a) be a horrible person and b) not affect change in any way.

*We are not the Republican Party. We are heterogenous and diverse. Our party has been compared to a herd of cats. Just keeping everyone headed in the same general direction is an accomplishment.

You might be thinking right now, ""Being a BernieBro is not good enough. You have to be a **Full Spectrum Liberal**.""

Guess what. Democratic leaders do not demand of any voter that they be ""Full Spectrum Liberals."" When they're in front of a Latino audience they largely retool their stump speeches to talk about Latino issues and what their Presidency will do *for Latinos specifically.* People who are fighting for the DREAMer movement or the Black Lives Matter movement are not, for the most part, Full Spectrum Liberals. They are **parochial liberals** *just like the Bernie Bro,* fighting for the one issue that they feel affects their lives the most. There is nothing wrong with being a ""one issue voter"" if you have one issue that you feel takes precedence above all others. Hillary Clinton would never accuse BLM of being **""single issue voters""** the way she characterized Sanders' campaign in the recent debate.

The Democratic coalition is **largely powered by single-issue groups** from Planned Parenthood to the Sierra Club. Adding Occupy Wall Street or Black Lives Matter to that list is a good thing not a bad thing.

It is only white cissexual heterosexual men whose issues and concerns are put down for being insufficiently intersectional. Guess what, if you demand full spectrum intersectionality of our white cis male voters, you're going to end up with less of them.

An economist by the name of Henry George shred this sentiment but with an asterisk for land. You see, of the three factors of production, land is the most inelastic as it cannot be moved and investing in land will not increase the amount of it. George thus considered those who made their wealth through land ownership to be rent seekers. George also believed that land ownership enabled natural monopolies to form, particularly in land-intensive sectors such as railways and utilities. He thus advocated that the government use a land value tax in place of every other tax. The LVT is similar to the property tax in that it taxes stationary assets. However, the LVT is only supposed to tax the land, not all of the improvements made to it.

Now let's look at the pros and cons:

**Pros**

* An income tax is a tax on labor. Capital gains tax is a tax on the profit made from selling an asset. Sales tax and VAT are taxes on consumption. It stands to reason that taxing investment and consumption will mean less of those things. Conservatives don't like high taxes because they believe that it will lead to less investment. Capital can be improved upon, so taxing capital gains or corporate income may lead to less economic growth. This would not be the case with the LVT because taxing land will not lead to less land. Instead of taxing Amazon or Jeff Bezos directly for capital gains, corporate income, or general income, you'd be taxing the land on which Bezos owns his mansions.
* An LVT would be progressive in nature because land ownership tends to correlate with more wealth overall (though not perfectly). The proletariat would be better off if the LVT replaced every single tax because their labor (income and payroll tax) and consumption (sales and VAT) are no longer taxed. And if they're renters, they wouldn't have to pay taxes at all.
* LVT incentivizes landowners to make their land useful. This is perhaps the greatest benefit for a few reasons.  

   * Land speculation drives up land prices, making land less affordable
   * Land speculation is a form of rent seeking. Investment used to speculate on land would instead be used on something which actually benefits society
   * Land speculation creates a perverse incentive to limit housing supply
   * Even if a landowner isn't holding onto land to speculate, empty plots of land don't contribute to society
* Land cannot be moved which means no capital flight.
* No tax avoidance can occur so long as land value is calculated properly.

**Cons**

* An LVT would require a land valuation separate from property.
* It is estimated that the total land value of the US is $23 trillion (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) or $26.55 trillion in 2021 dollars. In 2020, the federal government made a total of $3.4 trillion while spending and spent over $6 trillion. In order to equal federal revenue, the LVT would have to be 13%. If the federal government wanted to break even or run a surplus, the tax would have to be 25%. This is all assuming that land values don't drop in the wake of such a tax and Georgists claim that it will, making the tax even higher. And that's just for the federal government. The result could possibly be extremely punitive for farmers.

   * The LVT was proposed back when the federal government's revenue was much smaller and when land made up a larger portion of total GDP. This may be why the LVT fell out of favor after the early 20th century.
* For how much lip service is paid towards the prevention of capital flight, land-intensive industries such as agriculture can move to other countries without an LVT. Furthermore, an LVT may decrease the demand for land, leaving at least some portion of land to public hands. This would decrease the amount of revenue from an LVT.
* Because the US constitution specifically requires the federal government to tax based on state population, an LVT would most likely not withstand a day in court. This means that the LVT would have to be authorized through a new constitutional amendment.

**Some acknowledgments:**

* An LVT requires a distinction between the land and the total property.
* There would have to be an exemption for state parks if this was implemented on a national level.
* As part of a climate change solution, a tax break for carbon sinks would be required.
* There could also be an exemption (or reduced rate) for reservations.
* An LVT would be best phased in gradually. Start at a small number and require people to pay both the original taxes and the LVT. Then do a tax rebate proportional to what they paid in LVT. People (and entities) who pay more in LVT than in any other federal tax combined would not have to pay federal income or capital gains tax.",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

Clinton hit back that her plan was more realistic than Sanders’.
“I don’t think I’ve changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas,” Clinton said.

The process of extraction, transporting, and storing natural gas has significant climate implications, as well. In fact, studies have suggested that the methane emissions associated with fracking for natural gas completely negate any climate benefit of using the “cleaner” fuel.
“I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy,” Clinton said.

So I want to try something different on this subreddit. Most of what we see on here is discussion on current politics. **However, what I want to do is present you guys with a fictional set of political candidates, in a pseudo-fictional area, and you guys predict the outcome of a possible U.S. Senatorial election.** I was inspired by an old post asking how the two Koreas could be unified.

So without further ado, I'll introduce the setting.

* Setting: The state of Menominee, in the Midwest U.S. The year is 2002. The state is somewhat hilly, with a river winding from south to north, splitting the state between east and west. On the north bank of the river, there is the state capital of Alexandria. Surrounded by Alexandria are several suburbs and exurbs, some stretching to the coast a very, very large lake.

* Alexandria is a very liberal city, and sports a sizable African-American, Muslim, and middle-class population. Banking and finance are important in the city as well. In 1999, *Mary Croy* magazine named the city the 2nd most important financial center in the Midwest, behind Chicago.

* The suburbs outside Alexandria are not liberal, but still lean left to some degree. However, some are very purplish and have voted GOP in the past.

* Travelling down the state you will find mostly rural lands and small towns. Conservatism reigns here, and the heartland of the state remains a Republican stronghold. However, the closer you get to the river, the more moderate the politics becomes. Notable towns such as Vanderburg and Lusitania tilt right, but have a strong Democratic minority. Tourism is big in this areas as well due to scenic beauty and river touring.

Towards the southern reaches of the state is the second largest city, Marquette. While not as liberal as Alexandria, Marquette is a democratic stronghold for Menominee.

**So, there are the main demographics of the state, now I'll get on to a few important notes.** This is 2002, right after 9/11. Patriotism is sky-high in the aforementioned conservative areas, and that translates to a considerable amount of Islamophobia. Alexandria supports a sizable Muslim population, and in statistics released by CNN, 985 violent acts have been perpetrated towards Muslim residents from September 2001 to May 2002. To break that down, that includes 877 verbal assaults and harassment, 69 acts of vandalism, 35 acts of physical violence, and 4 acts of murder. Outside of Islamophobia, public support for the war in Afghanistan is sky high as well, even among Liberals.

So, now onto the candidates for the 2002 Senate Elections, including Dem and GOP primaries. Note: The seat is currently open, as the current Republican senator is retiring and won't run in 2002.

**Democratic Side**

* Nadia Turner - Age: 55 - Nadia Turner is an African-American politician representing the 4th district of Menominee in Congress. The 4th district includes a good chunk of Alexandria and several suburbs. Turner is very famous in her state, being first elected to Congress in 1988. Since then, she has pioneered several successful EITC expansion bills (EITC is a tax break program that analyzes a family's earnings and their number of children in order to determine how much is deducted from the taxes they'd have to pay). Nadia is popular with the African american community, but not so much with the liberal and populist community. She supports the war in Afghanistan and has since remained quiet on Islamophobia. She stood by the Clintons in the 90s, and received flak from GOP pundits after they associated her with Hillary Clinton's failed healthcare initiative in 1993 and 1994. Furthermore, Nadia recently went through a messy divorce which could impact her poll numbers. Nadia is currently enjoying a small, one-digit lead over her primary opponents. Nadia Turner is endorsed by former Governor of Menominee Linda Carran, NY Senator Hillary Clinton, and State Senator Mary-Ann Kerry.

* Blake McClaine - Age: 48. Blake McClaine is the Attorney-General of Menominee, serving since his appointed in 1999. McClaine previously served as U.S. House Representative from 1993 - 1999. He is a self-proclaimed Blue Dog moderate, and supports full military action in Afghanistan. On social issues, he does not support same-sex marriage, but nevertheless supports legislation aimed at curbing anti-gay discrimination. Interestingly enough, he has prosecuted several cases against anti-Muslim crimes, including several hundred following 9/11. He is also a favorite among left-leaning Christians and the religious left. McClaine currently trails close to Nadia Turner, and is a second place, but he could easily become front-runner if he plays his cards right. McClaine is endorsed by the Blue Dog state office, State senator Amanda Lune-Haggerty, and former Menominee Senator Lydia Klein.

* Gerard Hammond - Age: 39 - Gerard Hammond is a young white activist and liberal community organizer. He is vehemently opposed to actions in Afghanistan, and has accused Turner of being apart of the ""neo-conservative Democratic elite"". He finds support mostly in the populist pockets of Alexandria and Marquette. Other notable facts about Hammond is that he claims that Islamophobia is an ""epidemic"" in Alexandria and both Dems and the GOP contribute to it. He is a distant third in polls. Hammond in endorsed by the Progressive Alliance of Menominee, and State assemblyman Patrick McMurdoch.

**Republican Side**

* Phillip Juravesse - Age: 63 - Phillip Juravesse is an Italian-American politician who currently serves as Menominee Lieutenant-General, since 1991. He is an ardent Reagan supporter, claiming him as an idol of his. He supports trickle-down economics, a stronger police force, and a renewal of ""Christian America"". He is popular in rural Menominee, especially in areas around Marquette. Juravesse supports actions in Afghanistan and further actions in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran. He ranks quite high in the polls, but is weakened by the progress of a younger, more conservative opponent, Richard Duncan. Duncan is endorsed by State Energy secretary Maryl Thomson, Former representative Allen Kilmer, Former representative Greg T. Scott, and former Senator from Menominee Casey Alexander.

* Richard Duncan - Age: 43 - Richard Duncan is a white young, energetic politician representing outer Marquette in the State assembly.

He has a similar position on the LGBT community, stating he does not believe they are true Americans, and thus they are not covered by the Constitution. Like Juravesse, Duncan supports an Evangelical agenda, but goes farther, and suggests that Christianity become the official state religion and evolution is banned from schools.

She supports a mainstream liberal agenda, including gay marriage, anti-discrimination in the workplace, and anti-islamophobia. She initially was against the war in Aghanistan, but has since publicly changed her opinion, stating that ""...[W]e must root out terror and extremism everywhere in the world, and we must start in Taliban Afghanistan."" She has also reached out to Reginald County Muslims, offering to pay for the renewal of vandalized mosques and to increase prosecution of anti-Muslim criminals. As the only Green Party candidate, she is the crowned frontrunner.

* Talvin Dehuys - Age: 39 - Talvin Dehuys is an artist and writer, living in the town of Newton as a freelance photojournalist. He has officially described himself as a centrist libertarian, supporting a socially progressive government, but one which ""takes its hand out of the cookie jar"" when it comes to the economy. Dehuys supports actions in Afghanistan, and remains quiet on anti-Muslim acts. He polls very low, but has an enthusiastic reception from those looking for an ""anti-politician"".

**However,** I personally cannot respect a straight ""No"" in the first two columns: ""Climate Change is Real"" and ""Climate Change is Man-Made"" (the table points out if there are any qualifiers to these straight Yes or No answers, and, for example, puts a Yes is the second column if the candidate believes that humans play at least *some* role, as is the case for Christie and Bush).

&nbsp;

Passive opposition e.g. Jamaica doesn't really have anything new to suggest or any differing ideals they cling to, but provide ""Critical support"" meaning they criticize every little thing the government does, argue that it is worse for the nation and vote against it on party lines, but campaign, promise the same things and govern the same when in power. 

The downsides are that if you believe something different, you have no option to vote for, and there is large voter apathy because voting won't really change much. The upsides are that the actions of the government are fairly predictable, so no huge shakeups in how the country is run every 5 years, and that the political climate is cooler, as well as being more efficient at working together and accomplishing shared goals

&nbsp;

Antagonistic opposition e.g. U.S.A. has wildly different ideals than the ruling party, therefore campaign and govern based on the ideals and basically split the nation in half along political lines, so whenever the opposition beomes the government, there is a large change in how things are run

Downsides are that getting anyting done is incredibly tedious and will most likely not be possible, a deeply divided population who hard a hard time working together for the better, and businesses get scared everytime government changes because it means huge changes in what they can and cannot do. Upsides are that your vote really matters for deciding how the country is run, the populous is invested in and cares about the state of the nation, leading to more discussion and thought on what they really want and an idea must be widely accepted as good before it is passed into law or policy

&nbsp;

Tl:dr;

Passive opposition speaks harshly, but doesn't really believe or do anything different, Antagonistic opposition has widely different ideals and fights for them. Former means things get done, but noone cares about politics, latter means lots of discussion (and fights) by voters, but little decisive action can be done",PoliticalDiscussion,climate change

Both websites are filled with hard data that explains the science in-depth.

A couple questions for skeptics:  

1.  How much time did you spend reading information from sources such as climate.nasa.gov before you made up your mind about climate change?  

2.  How much time did you spend reading skeptic information before you made up your mind?

3.  If you have spent significant time reading the science, which bit of evidence do you feel most significantly supports the theory of climate change?   And which evidence most significantly disproves the theory?

As well as provisions to address climate change.

However, the bill appears to be stuck in limbo due to opposition from the more conservative elements of the Democratic Party in Congress, particularly Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who have argued for the bill to be trimmed down considerably, citing concerns over debt and inflation, to the anger of the more liberal/progressive wing of the party who argue their opposition is in part thanks to lobbying from certain interests and sectors opposed to the bill, especially the fossil fuel industry and Manchin’s connections to the coal industry in his state.

What’s more, progressives have begun to raise alarm bells at how Manchin in  appears to be constantly shifting the goalposts over what is needed to gain his support for the bill instead of committing to a final position, dragging out negotiations in the process that has arguably weakened the Democrats by portraying then as a party wracked by infighting and incapable of governing, contrasted with the more disciplined and unified Republicans who are exploiting voter discontent over inflation and other issues to great effect. A similar dynamic here in the UK would be Labour and the Conservative Party respectively.

This has raised suspicions that Manchin has no intention of ever passing the social bill, and that for all intents and purposes “Build Back Better” is dead. Any negotiation at this point from Biden and Schumer would be a waste of time.

The fear the Democrats have is that without the social bill, and the damage caused by the public infighting over it, Biden’s already weak polling will go permanently underwater for the remainder of his term with turnout for the Democrats weakening in the process due to perceived failure to get any meaningful legislation done, and voter discontent over inflation becoming baked in. Thus leading to the Republicans recapturing Congress next year,  and leaving them in a *very* favourable position to win the White House in 2024.

Overall, the majority consensus from what I gather appears to be very pessimistic, even downright fatalistic in some observed corners, in the social bill ever passing at this stage. Still, others appear hopeful that some form of the bill will eventually pass and that the opposition from Manchin and other conservative Democrats is simply performative theatre in order to save face before their constituents. Many have cited that Manchin still largely votes party line despite his reputation as a conservative Democrat. And that once the bill passes, any public distaste over the infighting will gradually fade from memory as the supply chain situation stabilises and the Dems polling can recover.

203,The Consequences of a Trump 3rd Party Run,10.0,3garlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3garlf/the_consequences_of_a_trump_3rd_party_run/,14.0,1439080314.0,"While it's entertaining and amusing to think about the prospects of a Trump 3rd party run, all the focus seems to be on how good it would be for Hillary and how disastrous it would be for the GOP.  And I don't disagree with that, at least for the would-be GOP nominee, but I wonder what the consequences would be for Democrats running for Congress in 2016.  Many of Trump's voters seem to be conservative independents and Republicans who would otherwise stay home if he weren't in the race.  What would their impact be on the down-ballot races?  Do they vote just for Trump and leave the rest of the ballot blank?  Or do they vote for the GOP who are, more likely than not, to align with their personal views?

My own theory is that the presence of Trump voters in the 2016 electorate means the GOP likely gets their votes on down-ballot races that could make the difference for vulnerable GOP incumbents and open seat races.  More Democrats will turn out in 2016 than 2014 but early indications seem to give the GOP the enthusiasm advantage.   Hillary wins the 3 way race but she may end up with a Congress even more fiercely opposed to her than the current one justified by claims she isn't ""legitimate"" given that ~55% of voters chose someone else.  

Taking that scenario even further:

* 2018 becomes another 2010 or 2014 redux where vulnerable Democratic incumbents start running against/avoiding a Clinton presidency blocked at every turn and mired in one congressional investigation after another.   Another GOP tidal wave drives Democratic numbers in Congress to new lows.  

* The stagnant economic climate persists (or another recession starts) and 2020 starts looking a lot like 2008 in reverse where a GOP candidate running on the mantle of change is swept into power with significant majorities in Congress.

A lot obviously can happen in 4 years and I think Hillary, if elected, will have a tough time with Congress regardless of whether Trump is in the race or not.  Still, I'm not sold on the theory that Trump ""destroys"" the GOP by running as 3rd party.

Comment as to what your stance on the issue is; am I right in wanting more moderates? Or are moderates not necessary for today's government? Do you think my diagnosis is wrong, or maybe there is another issue that I have overlooked? Tl;Dr is at the bottom, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't read the entire post :)     


 Following the Democratic debate I was amazed to see how big the tent is for the Democratic Party.  Hillary, Sanders, Webb, and Chaffee all represent different factions that exist within the Democratic Party, with O'Malley filling in the gaps between Sanders and Hillary.  And yet both Senator Webb and Senator Chaffee were crucified during the debate because of their past voting records/statements.  This, I think, is a bad sign for both the Democratic Party as well as for the nation as a whole.  So let us examine these two:
Jim Webb has been in public life for ages now, even serving as Secretary of the Navy under Reagan for a year.  Sen. Webb wears many hats including: Vietnam vet, accomplished historical writer, and a veritable Blue-Dog Democrat.  It is this last hat, him being a Blue-Dog, that I want to focus on for now.  To summarize and simplify a longstanding political faction, Southern Democrats were often understood to be the more conservative part of the Democratic Party;they are oriented towards state's rights, a belief in fiscal responsibility, a strong military, and an emphasis on ""family values"" are all features of a Blue-Dog Democrat.  During the 20th century there was a so-called ""conservative coalition"" in which the moderates of both parties would often work together in order to compromise and pass legislation.  It is important to note that Southern Democrats (another name for Blue-Dogs as they were concentrated in the south) were in tension with their northern counterparts who composed the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.  

 Since around the 70's, more and more Blue-Dogs have been voted out as both parties began to fill issue-vacuums that their counterparts left.  What I mean by an ""issue-vacuum"" is easily explained by using an example: in 1980, Ronald Reagan ran a campaign that had a pro-life stance.  Up until this point there were both pro-life Democrats and Republicans, but it was not until Ronald Reagan adopted the issue as a part of his platform that it became a partisan issue.  In fact, the issue of abortion was split more along religious lines than partisan; Catholics in Congress, who were largely Democratic, were on average more opposed to abortion than other wings of the Democratic Party, while the Episcopalians of the Republican Party did not much care about the issue (more about this later).  With Reagan championing the issue, people started to equate a pro-life stance as a Republican one, and so pro-life individuals started to drift towards the Republican Party.  In contrast, Democrats did not take a stance on the issue in one way or another until after the Republican Party had solidified their position on the issue; in other words, there was a vacuum to be filled, and so the Democrats filled it.  What had once been a cultural divide had now become a political one, and with the newfound division there was less room for those that floated in the middle of the political spectrum.  Now that both party’s took a stance on abortion, Republican’s became synonymous with pro-life, and Democrats became the pro-choice party—there could be no more middle ground on the issue.  This caused Democrat and Republican politicians of both parties to have to rethink with which party they will be a part of, causing Southern Democrats and liberal Republicans to shift their party identifications.  

Which now brings me back to the examples of Jim Webb and Lincoln Chaffee.  Since I have largely ignored Chaffee thus far, I will briefly talk about him.  Lincoln Chafee is a part of a political dynasty in Rhode Island.  His father was a “country-club Republican” as was he when he first came into office.  A country-club Republican, otherwise known as a liberal Republican, was someone who believed in smaller government involvement in the private sector of business, but also did not place much emphasis on social issues such as abortion and the like.  These individuals often found themselves in the Northeastern states, and as such were surrounded by Liberal Democrats as opposed to their Southern colleagues.  Lincoln Chafee, much like Jim Webb, found himself affected by the changing political atmosphere as well—something he himself acknowledged when he said “I didn’t leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left me”.  And he is right, because Sen. Chafee would be someone who doesn’t much care about socially conservative issues such as abortion, gay marriage, and religious liberty issues, and is someone who would be more concerned about government involvement in the workplace.  But because the Republican Party took more and more socially conservative stances on issues, Chafee had to rethink which party he wanted to identify with more; the party that was socially conservative or fiscally liberal?

 In summary, we need more individuals like Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee.  They represent the old-style status quo of the 20th century, a time period that we look back on with such want that a literal campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again”.  I am almost positive that with more politicians like Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee there would be a healthier legislative climate in Congress right now, as I am almost positive of the fact that these two could find common ground they could agree upon.  However, the persistence with which both parties seek to diametrically oppose one another so as to pick-up the votes that the other leaves behind when taking a particular policy position is corrosive to a healthy democracy.  A more fluid and inclusive definition of what it means to be a “Democrat” and a “Republican” is what needs to happen, otherwise the political parties will continue to spiral away from one another only to create an insurmountable divide in policy positions.  At one time it took but a bridge in order to come to a compromising position on legislation; before long it could take a high-wire rope act to bridge the divide between the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties—we need more Jim Webb’s and Lincoln Chafee’s. 

TL;DR Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb represent politicians from a bygone era, during which America enjoyed a Congress that could find compromise and pass legislation.  Due to a changing political landscape, however, Liberal Republicans and Southern Democrats could no longer split the partisan divide and so were forced to choose between the two.  Ever since then, our nation's government has only gotten more and more partisan, and compromise has become a toxic word.  For the Government to work again, Democrats and Republicans need to redefine what their partisan label means so as to be more inclusive of differing opinions within their party's.  Without a tolerance for moderates there can be no hope for a working Congress, or a less-partisan political environment in the future; as such, we need more Jim Webb's and Lincoln Chafee's.

45,Megathread: Recall Election against California Governor Newsom Fails,22576.0,poii2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/poii2s/megathread_recall_election_against_california/,6241.0,1631677939.0,"NBC News and CNN have projected that the gubernatorial recall against incumbent Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has failed. With over 60% of the expected vote in and nearly 8 million votes counted, the No vote (which would retain the Governor) maintains a 67-33 edge and a raw vote lead of nearly 2.8 million. While the remaining vote is expected to be more Republican and, thus, the margin will shrink throughout the night and in the coming days, the remaining vote is unlikely to impact the outcome of the recall.

Had the recall succeeded, Question 2, on who Governor Newsom’s successor would have been, currently shows Republican radio talk show host Larry Elder with 43% of the vote, leading his nearest rival, Democratic YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, who trails with 11% of the vote.

Every two years we get the chance to fire every single member of the House of Representatives, and on November 4th our two year wait is up!  If you don't step up and act you'll miss your chance to go to the polls and make your voice heard.  We owe it to Congress to show them just how much we appreciate all their hard work and tireless dedication to our country.

[Every single one of the 435 members of the House of Representatives is eligible to be replaced.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2014)  
  
[33 out of 100 Senators is eligible to be replaced.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014)

**EDIT FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE SARCASM: Congress worked just 126 days in 2013, that averages out to around 2.5 days per week.**

---------------------------

Here are some questions to ask yourself between now and November:  

 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to make wise decisions when it comes to Net Neutrality?  Or do you agree with Republican Representative Fred Upton and Republican Representative Greg Walden that [Net Neutrality is a ""solution in search of a problem?""](http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/538661/republicans_protest_fcc_net_neutrality_move_isps_less_concerned/)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to make wise investments in science and technology?  Or do you agree with Republican Representative and member of the House Science Committee Paul Broun that science such as evolution, embryology, and the big bang theory are [""lies straight from the pit of hell?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rikEWuBrkHc)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to support equal rights for homosexuals, or do you agree with Representative Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. that [""The court-ordered redefinition of marriage in several states … is an assault on the foundations of our society, challenging the institution which, for thousands of years in virtually every civilization, has been entrusted with the rearing of children and the transmission of cultural values?""](http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/11/07/gay-rights-foe-marsha-blackburn-reelected-congress-tennessee)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to enact new regulations that will help slow or halt the advance of climate change, or do you believe that it's a hoax because [“If you believe in the Bible, one would have to say the Great Flood is an example of climate change. That certainly wasn’t because man had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy.” as Representative Joe Barton, R-Texas does?](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/republican-congressman-cites-biblical-great-flood-to-say-cim)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to help the poorest amongst us and raise Americans out of poverty, or do you think something like raising the minimum wage [""would do more harm to our economy than anything. You work at Arby’s, the cost of products, the cost of services are going to go up. [...] If we are going to make it a living wage, who’s going to pay for it? Who’s going to pay for it?"" as was suggested by Representative Dennis Ross, R-Florida.](http://thinkprogress.org/election/2014/04/16/3427197/dennis-ross-minimum-wage/)
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives, or are you going to vote them out?

---------------------------
  
I'd also like to address some of the common concerns when I try to encourage people to vote:

 * **""They're all the same anyway.""**
   * This is demonstrably not true.  Currently our political parties are more polarized than they have been in more than a century.  If we look at [party-line votes in the Senate](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/senate/members/) and [the House of Representatives](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/house/members/) the distance between the parties are obvious.  For the average Redditor the differences between the haven't been as stark in our lifetimes. (These visulizations may be easier to read: [Senate Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=892) | [House Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=887))  
 * **""Not voting is the same as a vote of no confidence.""**
   * We have tried not voting before.  In fact we have tried not voting sixteen times in the last seventy years.  Less than half of eligible voters turned out for midterm elections in [1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/voter-turnout/) which means that in 100% of midterm elections since 1950 a *minority* of Americans were allowed to pick a new House of Representatives.
   * Not voting is tantamount to saying ""Things are good enough in my life that I'm going to let you keep your job"" because why would an elected official change anything if they're reelected?  They don't care if they win with 100% turnout or if they win with 10% turnout just as long as they win.
   * Not voting just gives more power to the people who *do* show up.  
 * **""Voting doesn't change anything anyway.""**
   * Nothing changes all at once but our history is riddled with slow but steady progress.  We have seen since 2010 the damage that can be caused by a single election, how one bad election can slow progress to a crawl and even drag us backwards.  Voting *can* and *does* make a difference, but first you need to vote.   
 * **""My vote doesn't count.""**  
   * No, your vote alone won't win the election.  Vote anyway.  You; by yourself, won't win a tug-of-war, that's why we all work together and we need *you* to pull your weight, especially now.
 * **""My district is [gerrymandered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) too much for the opposition to stand a chance.""**
   * Gerrymandering has no effect on state-wide elections, so if you don't vote because of gerrymandering you're missing out on the opportunity to vote for Governor, Senator and any of a number of ballot initiatives.  
 * **""There's no one on the ballot that represents me, or represents my views.""**
   * Then you need to represent your views for yourself.  Go to the polling place and write in ""NO CONFIDENCE"" for any; or all, of the eligible seats.  Not voting says nothing but ""Everything is fine, my life is good, I don't want anything to change"" so go and vote ""NO CONFIDENCE"" and make your voice heard.
 * **""If voting changed anything it would be illegal.""**
   * For the vast majority of human history voting was functionally illegal, as leaders were picked through birth or war or appointment or God.  The very thought of letting the people vote was considered dangerous and absurd.  
   * When our country was founded it was illegal for anyone except white, land owning males to vote.
   * It was illegal for African Americans to vote until 1870.
   * It was *practically* illegal for African Americans to vote until 1965.
   * It was illegal for women to vote until 1920.
   * It was illegal for 18 year-olds to vote until 1971.  
 * **""Why should I have to choose between a Douche Turd and a Giant Sandwich?""**
   * I guess you should have voted in the primaries so that D. Turd and G. Sandwich would never have gotten to the general election... 
   * Also: No human is so black or white, no policy is so clearly right or wrong, no political party is so good or evil.  The Sandwich analogy is a painful oversimplification of both voting and of political candidates.
   
There are those who will try to tell you that they're too weak, that they're actions and votes are worthless, that it is better to sit in silence than to stand up and be counted; these people have become so convinced of their powerless impotence that they will try to convince others of the same thing.  Just like an alcoholic will try to force you to drink, the timid will try to force you to stay silent.  Smile and nod and vote anyway, because you are not weak, you are not powerless, you are not impotent unless you let yourself be.

Think of them like the fat friend that's always trying to convince you to eat cake.

The biggest point I would like to make here is that yes, your vote does count.  The person who convinces you not to vote, votes twice.

And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong **without** either isolating ourselves or **trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.**

>I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is **political hot air.** Well, **so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It’s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.** Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin. 


-Barack Obama

>CLINTON: Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, **we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.**

-Hillary Clinton

#Clinton supports the same policies that led to the vacuums of power in the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS and ENDLESS WAR. 

When Hillary Clinton says things like this and wants to focus on taking out Assad and creating a power vacuum in the middle east before taking out ISIS she sounds insane. These aren't liberal or progressive positions. When Clinton says these things she is disagreeing with nearly every democratic president before her. **Is it not clear that she is working for other interests?**

>SANDERS: I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war.

>But I think -- and I say this with due respect -**that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.**

>**Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.**

>**But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS**

**Hillary Clinton also has no comprehensive tax plan and has no way to make her proposals fit into the budget anymore than Sanders does. Clinton's plan is to expand EVERYTHING and make cuts no where.** Sanders at least is realistic about his plans. We can eliminate medicare/medicaid/ss and replace them with universal healthcare and cut Military spending by 50% and still have the strongest military.

Clintons ""tax plan"" consists of a few tax rates and proposals to ""close tax loop holes"" but she doesn't state which ones. She doesn't state how her tax plan will directly pay for her health plan or expansion of the military or any of her other proposals. **Hillary Clinton has no math that shows how her plan will fit into the budget.** Literally all she has is a few tax percentages. That's not a plan.

Now let's break down her ""college plan"" which is not a real plan either:

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact-costs/

Where does it say how she'll pay for it? It's all non-speak. It's not a real plan because it's lacking details. Am I expected to go through every page on her site and add up every number?

>Clinton's New College Compact plan costs in the range of $350 billion over 10 years and will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate. 

What loopholes? What expenditures? There is no REAL information here, and this is exactly how Sanders wants to pay for his plan.  

>We need to make ambitious investments so that cost is no longer a barrier to college education, and the burden of debt does not hold back everyday Americans.

This is meaningless drivel. Is she seriously talking about betting tax money on more ""investments""?

>More than half of the total will go towards grants to states and colleges. 

Half of what??? Her ""investment"" This is scary! Her college plan is based on betting money.

>These grants will ensure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition and that support will also help reduce the burden of living expenses at 4-year public colleges. 

How? she doesn't know what the number will be.

>They will provide free tuition at community colleges, support private non-profit colleges that keep costs low and provide value, and relieve debt for students who commit to national service. 

Again: how? She's not really explaining where the money came from or how much it will be because she doesn't know.

>These new grants will be paired with holding states and colleges accountable for bringing down costs.

Ah, so she will place some of the burden on the states and colleges themselves, another unpredictable variable in Clintons wild ride.

>Around one-third of the funds will go toward relief on interest from student debt.

A third of what???!! This entirely depends on her ""investments"" paying off. Load of shit.

>This includes allowing every American with outstanding public debt to refinance their student loans at today's low interest rates, cutting interest rates to reflect the government’s cost of debt,

Exactly what Sanders wants to do.

>and making it far easier for students to enroll in income-based repayment that limits crushing debt.

Still don't know how, but okay...

>The remaining funds will support innovative new investments to create a higher education system for the 21st Century. That means new funds to expand new models of life-long learning, rewarding college completion and enrollment, and broadening support for student parents.

#Where is the comprehensive plan Hillary? Put up or shut up.

I am Andrew Yang, Democratic candidate for President of the United States in 2020. The leading policy of my platform is the Freedom Dividend, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month to every American adult aged 18+. I believe this is necessary because technology will soon automate away millions of American jobs—indeed, this has already begun. The two other key pillars of my platform are Medicare for All and Human-Centered Capitalism. Both are essential to transition through this technological revolution. I recently discussed these issues in-depth on the Joe Rogan podcast, and I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions based on that conversation for anyone who watched it.  

I am happy to be back on Reddit. I did one of these March 2018 just after I announced and must say it has been an incredible 12 months. I hope to talk with some of the same folks.

I have 75+ policy stances on my website that cover climate change, campaign finance, AI, and beyond. Read them here: www.yang2020.com/policies

Biden and Kamala D. Harris will take the Oath of Office today, becoming the 46th President and Vice President of the United States of America.

Today's inauguration is unprecedented, for a number of reasons. Among them, Kamala Harris will become the first woman to serve as Vice President. Meanwhile, the ceremony itself will look markedly different, with limited audience due to COVID-19 restrictions, and a drastically increased security presence in response to concerns as a result of the insurrection at the Capitol on 1/6/2021.

Incoming President Biden’s Inauguration speech is expected to be 20-30 minutes long with a focus on unity and a need to bring the county together. Widespread reports are that the Biden Administration has already laid out ambitious plans to overhaul immigration policy, address Climate Change, combat COVID-19 and provide economic relief to those affected by the pandemic during their first 100 days in office.

Inadequate access to healthcare, student loan debt that I may never be able to repay for an education that I can’t use because the school is insolvent, climate change and a stagnant government has created an atmosphere of despair that was slowly smothering me. I live to serve, it’s what led me to the Air Force and it’s what’s motivating my canandicy now. I cannot sit on the sidelines witnessing suffering if it feels there’s something I can do to alleviate it.

I was so inspired by Andrew Yang, his authenticity and compassion was enough to get me to give the Freedom Dividend a second look because I was NOT a fan at first. But the more I studied, the more curious I got and the more it made sense. It took awhile for me to come around but now I’m all in. I have realized that not only is it POSSIBLE for our economy to support a guaranteed income for all but that it has the potential to alleviate, or at least lessen, so much of the suffering that continues to be perpetuated by systemic inequality.

The specific details of how a UBI will be funded and how much we could actually afford to pay each person are still up for debate. If elected I intend to push that debate forward every chance I get by seeking mutual understanding and cooperation with compassion and empathy. I am so grateful for all the hard work and sacrifice of everyone who came before me but we’ve been following a false story over a cliff and the ground is coming up fast. It is clear to me that the America my parents and grandparents still dream of is not an America that’s worth leaving to my kids. 

In the Air Force, they taught us to “aim high,” and It is my aim to win the honor of representing Tennessee in the US House of Representatives, to create an environment where my children and yours can live with health, dignity, and financial security.

No woman has ever been elected to US House Seat TN-01 for a full term. It’s been a Republican seat for 140 years. Now it’s open and folks want change. I'm Blair Walsingham, the gun slingin' Air Force momma homesteader who’s taking Trump Country by storm with my message of humanity. Ask me anything!

Biden and Kamala D. Harris will take the Oath of Office today, becoming the 46th President and Vice President of the United States of America.

Today's inauguration is unprecedented, for a number of reasons. Among them, Kamala Harris will become the first woman to serve as Vice President. Meanwhile, the ceremony itself will look markedly different, with limited audience due to COVID-19 restrictions, and a drastically increased security presence in response to concerns as a result of the insurrection at the Capitol on 1/6/2021. 

Incoming President Biden’s Inauguration speech is expected to be 20-30 minutes long with a focus on unity and a need to bring the county together. Widespread reports are that the Biden Administration has already laid out ambitious plans to overhaul immigration policy, address Climate Change, combat COVID-19 and provide economic relief to those affected by the pandemic during their first 100 days in office.

I will come back later tonight to answer more questions. Bye for now.**

As a computer engineer, I’m not exactly your typical candidate for office. I started out designing smart meters for commercial usage. As a product manager I went on to lead large product lines from business-class notebooks used by tens of millions worldwide, to microcontrollers found in virtually everything from washing machines to commercial jets. Later, I founded my own tech consulting firm.

In the mid-2000’s I witnessed my employer move manufacturing to Mexico and layoff all assembly workers. Many of them had no career retraining options and never worked a decent paying job again and this left a profound impact. I subsequently became an active volunteer in my community and was elected president of a 4000+  member nonprofit that provides free training and education to working professionals.

As an engineer and tech entrepreneur, I find solutions to complicated large scale problems. After the 2018 election cycle, I left my job in order to research the needs of my district and this is what I found:

**People who work for a living** are America’s biggest assets, yet more than half of all Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck in debt, and homelessness is growing.

**Our medical system** is designed to make billions in profits while tens of thousands of Americans needlessly die every year, hundreds of thousands go bankrupt, and 80  million remain uninsured or under-insured.

**Our economy** is tilted to create a handful of billionaires while working people are paid to survive instead of earning according to the value they create.

**Our planet** is sustaining irreversible damage so that corporations can report short-term favorable earnings for the benefit of a few investors.

**If we want our democracy to survive, average working people must come together to solve these challenges. That’s why I’m running.**

[**PLATFORM**](https://votefordonna.com/)

My platform is designed to rebuild the crumbling foundation of our country by lifting up every American — people who work every day and carry America on their shoulders — so we can all flourish together, continue to innovate, and lead economically.

My platform presents original solutions to America’s most pressing issues.

* **Healthcare for All** – scaling single-payer (Medicare for All) healthcare infrastructure to accommodate \~80 M uninsured and under-insured while drastically lowering cost and maintaining high quality of care.
* **Education for All** \- lowering the cost of all types of education including trade schools and incentivizing students to pursue education in high-demand fields and serve in underserved and rural communities. Establish non-military GI bill.
* **RealPay for All** – paying working people so they can afford to live where they work, save towards the American Dream, and fund Social Security so we can retire with dignity.

I have also crafted detailed positions on Veterans benefits, Rural America and Farmers, Climate Change, Justice System Reform, Gun Violence Reform and Immigration.

##The nature of lobsters

**Lobsters** are [decapod crustaceans](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2464), 'ten-footed' marine animals, a classification which includes clawed lobsters, spiny lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and crayfish. The precise nature of lobsters, specifically whether they are fish, has been a contested issue in international law for more than one hundred years. There are [30 species](http://www.mesa.edu.au/crustaceans/crustaceans05b.asp) of clawed lobsters, but the most important is the *Homarus americanus* or American lobster, which is found in the Atlantic. More than half of all lobster products are produced in Canada and the United States while the top three lobster-importing countries are Japan, China, and the U.S. There are 45 species of *Panulirus spp.* or spiny lobsters and *Jasus spp.* or [rock lobsters](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/200/m200p241.pdf), which are found near the coasts of Florida, Brazil, Cuba, and Australia, and are grouped together. Australia and New Zealand are the biggest producers of spiny lobster products. *Homarus gammarus*, the [European lobster](https://www.imr.no/genimpact/filarkiv/2007/07/european_lobster.pdf/en), can be found from the Norwegian Sea to the Aegean Sea. Lobsters are not stationary: they migrate an average of 30 kilometres (19 miles) a year, though some migrate more than [900 miles](https://mlcalliance.org/all-about-lobster/lobster-101-habitat/), making lobster management and ownership difficult and contentious. Lobsters have existed for at least [120 million years](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-lobster/mexico-finds-worlds-oldest-lobster-fossil-idUSN0242811320070503) and live as long as [140](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4213315/George-the-140-year-old-lobster-to-be-released-by-New-York-restaurant.html) years, showing little cell degradation as they age. They are also capable of [reflex amputation](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/fun-facts-about-luscious-lobsters), regrowing lost limbs.

##Why lobsters are so valuable

The [global lobster market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4775667/lobster-market-global-industry-trends-share?utm_source=BW&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=xs7x4l&utm_campaign=1271187+-+Global+Lobster+Market+Overview+%26+Outlook+2019-2024+-+Leading+Players+are+East+Cost+Seafood%2c+Garbo+Lobster%2c+High+Liner+Foods%2c+Escanaba%2c+and+Thai+Union&utm_exec=joca220prd) is worth €6.7 billion/$5.7 billion USD (2018). Market researchers project the lobster trade will reach €12.51 billion/$13.9 billion USD in value in 2024. The current value of lobsters is based almost solely as seafood, but that may change. There are [more than 200](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/) known applications for lobsters and lobster by-products. Chitin, a biopolymer derived from lobster shells, can be extracted easily and cheaply by grinding up the shells, which traditionally have been trashed. Adding sodium hydroxide to chitin produces [chitosan](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af57/fa5a2b237174301b9b2740adbbe531a4a527.pdf), a carbohydrate with biomedical applications. The U.S. Army has used more than 400,000 [field bandages](https://www.wired.com/2007/02/shrimp-bandages-save-soldiers/) from shrimp chitosan and now a company has created [lobster-based](https://www.timesrecord.com/articles/front-page/maine-firm-creating-bandages-made-with-lobster-shells/) chitosan bandages. MIT and Harvard University researchers are turning lobster chitin into a flexible, more maneuverable, [body armor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/19/mit-scientists-are-using-lobsters-develop-new-form-flexible-body-armor/). Researchers at [McGill University](https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/waterfront/scientists-find-better-way-to-make-use-of-lobster-shells/), the Royal College of Art, and Imperial College London have made lobster chitin into a recyclable, biodegradable [alternative](https://www.businessinsider.com/lobster-shells-plastic-biodegradable-recycle-single-use-waste-2019-5) to single use plastic products like straws and plastic bags. Researchers at the University of Havana have developed [surgical threads](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm) and stitches from lobsters. Lobster chitin can also act as a [surgical implant](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/12/08/researchers-find-new-way-to-convert-lobster-shells-into-durable-plastic/). [Lobster blood](https://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/20/business/lobster-blood-could-be-the-next-best-thing-to-help-treat-warts-shingles/) treats warts and shingles and other skin issues. [Chitin](https://www.joc.com/crabs-lobsters-claw-their-way-uses-medicine-and-food_19880608.html) is a food preservative. It treats itching from burn wounds. It is used in [nutraceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336979/), nutritional, medicinal products, and [pharmaceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), medicinal drugs. Chitin acts as chickenfeed and can be made into [dog biscuits](https://archive.bangordailynews.com/2006/03/09/making-it-in-maine-lobster-bisque-its-let-canine-companions-enjoy-seafood/) and compost. It is used in food packaging, bio-stimulant wheat [seed coating](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm), sonar technology, [self-healing car paint](https://newatlas.com/self-healing-car-paint/11254/), [flu decontaminants](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/bm200970x), and [antiviral drugs](https://newatlas.com/chitin-cheaper-antiviral-drugs/21457/).

Humans have eaten lobsters for thousands of years. Lobsters are typically boiled alive to prevent transmission of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in lots of seafood, which spreads through lobsters within hours of their deaths. Untreated vibrio infections have a [30-50%](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/seafood-lovers-dangers-vibrio-bacteria/story?id=56688448) mortality rate. Lobsters are also difficult to transport for long periods as they tend to get sick and die or resort to cannibalism in confined spaces. Lobsters are a [high protein, low fat](https://www.seafoodworld.net/nutritional-value-of-lobsters/) food and are arguably superior to red meat. As researchers from the University of Adelaide [explain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), ""The amino acid profile of crustacean protein such as lobster is comparable to that of red meat protein, but it contains more nonprotein nitrogen (amino acids, small peptides, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine, creatine, creatinine, and nucleotides) ranging from 10–40%. Thus, crustacean protein is more palatable than meat proteins.""

##Lobster conflicts

###China, the U.S., and Canada

####U.S. regulations

American lobstermen have been subjected to tremendous economic pressure, first from government regulation, then hurricanes, competition from Canada, and now the U.S.-China trade war. The North Atlantic right whale, a critically endangered species, tends to get tangled in the ropes lobstermen use in their lobster traps. The population has been in a decade-long decline, mostly dying after getting tangled or struck by boats. In [2009](https://bangordailynews.com/2009/11/15/news/lobster-fishermen-shed-floating-rope/), the U.S. government forced lobstermen to switch from floating rope to sinking rope, and 1.6 million pounds of rope had to be discarded and replaced. In 2015, the government limited trap lines and lobstermen switched to stronger lines, which [actually killed more whales](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/whaletrp/trt/meetings/September%202018/tm247__2_.pdf). The federal government is [now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/noaas-plan-to-save-the-whales-has-maine-lobstermen-boiling-11567809249) pressuring the industry to come up with more regulations to address the issue. In 2018 and again in [2019](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maines-lobster-industry-braces-catastrophic-cuts-bait-fish-catch), the U.S. government imposed stringent herring quotas. Lobstermen, who relied on herring as lobster bait, [switched](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/05/28/lobster-bait-herring-shortage-fisheries) to pig hides and other species of fish from outside local areas. American lobstermen are regulated at five levels of government: local, state, federal, international, and by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/about-us/program-overview), an inter-state compact created by the federal government in 1942. Competitors outside the U.S. face less regulation and lax enforcement of existing rules.

####Canadian competition

Canada has [only recently](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/canada-boosts-protection-of-north-atlantic-right-whales) moved to protect the whales and has far fewer restrictions on lobster fishing. For example, Canadian lobstermen do not have a lobster maximum [size limit](https://www.savingseafood.org/news/washington/sen-susan-collins-questions-lobster-tariffs-and-grey-zone-dispute/) while American lobstermen are [limited](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html) to catching lobster's with a body shell length of five inches. The bigger the lobster shell, the more meat it has and the greater the lobster's value. In [September 2017](https://bangordailynews.com/2019/08/26/news/hancock/its-lost-much-of-its-overseas-business-but-a-lobster-firm-is-starting-up-in-bucksport/), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement went into affect, eliminating 98% of EU tariffs on Canadian goods. It allowed Canada to export lobsters to the EU, replacing American lobster exports. That same month Florida lobstermen [lost 100,000 lobster traps](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article228822799.html) to Hurricane Irma.

####U.S.-China trade war

The U.S.-China trade war has turned Maine - and Senator Susan Collins - into a target for retaliatory tariffs. Maine lobster exports to China increased by [169%](https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/maine-delegation-urges-aid-for-members-of-lobster-industry-affected-by-trade-war) from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, the U.S. government placed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 25% tariff on American goods, including live lobsters. On September 1, 2019, China retaliated again, raising the tariff to 35%. U.S. lobster exports to China have [declined by 80%](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2019/08/26/how-chinas-tariffs-are-affecting-u-s-lobster-exports) while Canadian lobster exports doubled. The U.S. government instituted a 25% tariff on raw steel imported from Canada and Mexico from 2018-2019. The tariff only covered *raw* steel not finished products made from steel, inadvertently making imported [lobster traps](https://www.kvcrnews.org/post/got-lobster-trumps-steel-tariffs-threaten-trap-industry#stream/0) price competitive with American-welded traps. The U.S. Commerce Department is now weighing whether China and Mexico have [dumped](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-imposes-new-tariff-chinese-mexican-steel) steel, which could result in another round of anti-dumping tariffs.

Some of the shift from 'American' to 'Canadian' lobster exports to China is contrived. Lobsters can grow to up to [four](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0616/How-large-can-lobsters-grow-Big!-But-no-one-knows-how-big) feet long, but lobster eggs are 1/16"". Lobster smuggling is a multi-million dollar enterprise in southeast Asia. Smugglers are now [trafficking American lobsters](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/us-companies-accused-of-dumping-lobster-in-asia) and [Australian rock lobsters](https://www.scmp.com/article/732369/rock-lobster-row-confirms-hk-asia-smuggling-hub) into China.

####Climate change

Climate change has been great for Maine lobstermen. The Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99% of the ocean, resulting in a [515% increase](https://www.gmri.org/news/news-archive/new-study-industry-conservation-ethic-proves-critical-gulf-maine-lobster-fishery) in Maine's lobster population over the last thirty years while other lobster populations elsewhere - like nearby Massachusetts - completely collapsed. However, warming waters also encouraged a growth in the [black sea bass](https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/03/12/black-sea-bass-gobbling-lobsters/) population, which gorge on baby lobsters.

Climate change may make the Maine lobster population [fall as hard](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1831) over the next thirty years as it rose over the last thirty years as lobsters permanently migrate north, avoiding the uncomfortably hot water in the Gulf of Maine. Our understanding of lobster biology is incomplete. For example, scientists did not know how to precisely determine a lobster's age until 2012, when the University of New Brunswick in Saint John found that [dissecting the eyestalks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rings-on-a-lobster-can-tell-its-age-1.1235997) of decapod crustaceans reveals rings that grow once per year. Scientists still debate whether lobsters are capable of feeling pain. We know [American](https://www.boem.gov/espis/5/5659.pdf) and spiny lobsters are magnetoreceptive and that magnetic fields play a role in determining lobster migration (like birds), but we do not know *[why](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Lohmann/publication/299648639_Effect_of_magnetic_pulses_on_Caribbean_spiny_lobsters_Implications_for_magnetoreception/links/5762b58608ae17328926f4ad/Effect-of-magnetic-pulses-on-Caribbean-spiny-lobsters-Implications-for-magnetoreception.pdf?origin=publication_detail)* they are magnetoreceptive or how this influences their movements. Studies have repeatedly found that electromagnetic fields generated by [undersea power cables](https://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Pacific-Region/Studies/2011-09-EMF-Effects.aspx) [influence](https://www.ecori.org/narragansett-bay/2019/9/11/sharks-lobsters-impacted-by-electric-cables-from-offshore-wind) lobster migration.

####Temperature

In the 1920s, studies concluded the ideal temperature for lobster breeding is 15 °C (59 °F) or higher (Huntsman, 1923, 1924). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the scientific consensus placed ideal temperatures at a mean annual sea temperature of 8 to 11 °C (48 to 52 °F) (Dow, 1969: 1062-1063). Today, the scientific consensus is that lobsters cannot handle temperatures above [20°C](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters) (68°F). A [2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783616303150) study found that lobster larvae are negatively affected at 20-24 °C (68-75 °F), but die off at 24-36 °C (75-97 °F), and recommended further examination of the effect of temperature on lobster survival. In 1999, scientists first [identified](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/23/nyregion/deaths-of-lobsters-in-long-island-sound-tied-to-tiny-parasite.html) a parasite, paramoebiasis, which seemed to kill lobsters weakened by high temperatures during a mass die-off. Paramoebiasis passes between infected and healthy lobsters within weeks of cohabitation. There is no guarantee that water temperatures will continue to rise in the Gulf of Maine as we may be at or near the crest of the [Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters). The [American Lobster Settlement Index](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2019/05/31/from-coast-to-coast-companies-team-up-to-fund-umaine-lobster-research/), first established in 1989, began surveying deep water lobster populations in 2016. ALSI is exploring the theory that lobsters are moving east into deeper (colder) water.

####Mortality

Lobster catches and landings have always fluctuated over multi-year periods with several past scares of unexplained mass die-offs, leading to premature fears of lobster extinction. The average female lobster has 10,000 eggs and females can have up to [100,000](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/faq-archive/fishfaq7.html) eggs, but the survival rate for baby lobsters in the wild is one tenth of one percent. In 2012, Norwegian aquarists [doubled](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121204081144.htm) the survival rate by altering lobster feed in a controlled setting. Experimental aquarists lowered Caribbean spiny lobster mortality in captivity to 3-70% through repeated experimentation, altering lobster feed and sterilizing seawater. The [National Lobster Hatchery](https://www.nationallobsterhatchery.co.uk/) in Cornwall, England has raised and released more than [100,000](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-27499270) healthy lobsters in captivity. This suggests that aquaculture may mitigate the historically high mortality rate in lobster larvae.

####Machias Seal Island

The U.S. and Canada both [claim](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/07/22/machias-seal-island-dispute) ownership of Machias Seal Island, a dispute that revolves around a 400-year old legal question. Canada argues that a 1621 land grant made Machias Seal Island part of Nova Scotia and that the 1783 Treaty of Paris exempted Nova Scotian islands from the islands Canada agreed belonged to the United States. The U.S. argues the grant did not make the island part of Nova Scotia and thus the Treaty of Paris recognized American sovereignty over the island. Canada controls the island itself and has had a lighthouse there since 1832. In [1984](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/67), the International Court of Justice delimited boundaries for the U.S. and Canada, but did not consider the issue of Machias Seal Island. In 2002, Canada legalized lobster fishing in the Grey Zone, the waters around the island where American lobstermen had previously enjoyed exclusive access. Enhanced immigration enforcement in the Trump administration has seen U.S. Border Patrol authorities detain Canadians in the Grey Zone while American lobstermen have begun [arming](https://www.wgbh.org/news/arts/2019/01/29/theres-a-quiet-war-over-lobsters-near-the-canadian-border) themselves, threatening Canadian lobstermen, and there has been mutual lobster trap sabotage. In 2009, disputes between the residents of Matinicus Island, an American island slightly west of Machias Seal Island, and the mainland U.S. also led to [armed confrontations](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32054066/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/police-maine-lobster-turf-war-led-shooting/#.XYPyDCV7l0s), and in 1998, Monhegan Island residents successfully lobbied for exclusive rights to lobstering near their island.

###Miskito, Nicaragua, and Honduras

The Miskito are a pre-Columbian, largely [Moravian](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009182968701500204?legid=spmis%3B15%2F2%2F49&patientinform-links=yes) Protestant people of 300,000. Their native land occupies eastern Honduras and Nicaragua. While Nicaragua and Honduras have a small share of the international lobster market, the lobster industry generates €133 million/$100 million USD (2014) in revenue. They export most of their catch to the United States, particularly the Florida-based restaurant chain [Red Lobster](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/02/honduras-death-looms-over-miskito-lobster-divers/). The Miskito [overwhelmingly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/cag.1999.21.3.10) make up Nicaragua's lobster divers, but do not own the actual lobster boats, earning only a pittance for their lobster catch. While North American lobstermen trap their lobsters, most Miskito lobstermen dive, a practice that is illegal in most countries because of the danger to divers who decompress too quickly. While North American lobsters are shipped alive, Miskito lobstermen sell frozen lobsters, a far less valuable product. While some American lobstermen [earn six figure salaries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oceans-tide-lobster-specialreport/ocean-shock-lobsters-great-migration-sets-up-boom-and-bust-idUSKCN1N420I), the poverty and desperation of Miskito lobstermen have led them to dive farther out to sea at greater depths and out of season, taking younger, smaller catch, inflicting permanent ecological damage to the lobster population and physical damage to themselves.

####Historical background

The Miskito nation became a British protectorate in 1638, an alliance that endured until 1860, when the British transferred sovereignty of the Miskito kingdom to Nicaragua (through the Treaty of Managua) while maintaining its self-governing autonomy. In 1894, the Nicaraguans annexed the Miskito's territory, violating the Treaty of Managua and triggering a brief British occupation. In the 1970s, the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama nations pressed Nicaragua's Somoza regime for land concessions and legally recognized self-rule, which they had had from 1860 to 1894. Somoza never gave in to their requests. In 1979, the Sandinista revolutionaries (FSLN) took control of Nicaragua and nationalized the seafood industry. Representatives of the three pre-Columbian nations presented Plan 81, defining formal borders for their lands. Instead of land reform and economic assistance, the Sandinistas [burned down and bombed](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/movies/on-13-sandinistas-vs-miskitos.html) Miskito villages, forcibly relocating the population they had economically disenfranchized. In 1985, the U.S. cut off all trade with Nicaragua, an embargo that lasted for four years. Nicaragua bypassed the order by presenting [millions of pounds of lobsters](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/world/us-gets-taste-of-managua-embargo.html) caught in Nicaragua as 'Honduran lobsters'. Japanese and Honduran lobstermen purchased lobster licenses, working in what Miskito considered their territory without their permission while the government [banned](https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1206/120652.html) lobster diving, which effectively shut out the Miskito from the industry because Miskito fishermen did not own lobster boats. In 1985, the American Indian Movement, which had been part of the international indigenous rights movement since the 1970s, threatened to [invade](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/world/us-indians-enlist-in-the-miskito-cause.html) Nicaragua. In 1988, they were finally granted autonomy (effective in 1990), and in 1990, the lobster ban was lifted.

In 2002 and 2006, the right-wing government of Enrique Bolaños provoked threats of secession from the Miskito (in Nicaragua and Honduras) when he pushed for a transnational dry canal. The canal was never built, but in 2009, the Miskito, partly motivated by [declining lobster profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/americas/10nicaragua.html), declared independence and have since been in a decade-long low level war with the Nicaraguan government with accusations of violent attacks (including beheadings), land seizures, arson, kidnapping, and rape. In 2013, President Ortega, hated by the Miskito for the original lobster ban, granted a concession to a Hong Kong-based company to build a full, transnational canal through Miskito territory. The Miskito conflict is largely confined to Nicaragua as Honduras now [recognizes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/12/honduras-miskito-indians-title-coastal-lands/2807695/) Miskito sovereignty over a territory of 1.86 million acres (920,000 hectares), the land the Miskito had been guaranteed control over in 1860.

####Lobsters and Cocaine

Cocaine traffickers have filled the void left by the Honduran government's withdrawal from Miskito lands. Honduras and Nicaragua do not have the mountains necessary to grow coca, but their location in between cocaine producing countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and cocaine consuming countries, namely the U.S., has made the ungoverned Miskito space a natural transshipment point for Colombian and Mexican drug cartels since about 2007. Some Miskito lobstermen, unable to make a steady living fishing, have collaborated with traffickers. USAID recognized the lobster-cocaine link and since 2008 has spent [almost a million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/world/americas/in-remote-honduras-area-drug-raid-stirs-anger.html) to beef up the lobster industry as part of its counter-narcotics strategy. Traffickers travel using planes and boats from Colombia to Bluefields, the capital of Nicaragua's Miskito territory. If traffickers think they have been spotted and risk arrest, they will dump their contraband into the ocean. The cocaine that is dumped and washes ashore is known as '[white lobster](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nicaraguan-town-rides-high-on-cast-off-cocaine-3168753.php)'. Finding and selling dumped cocaine has become its own profession as the average cocaine package is worth more than €91,000/$100,000 USD in a region with per capita incomes below €5,400/$6,000 USD. Some Miskito nationalists in Nicaragua have [openly suggested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13210289) collaborating with drug cartels and accepting that the Miskito economy is now a narco-economy.

###Canada, France, and the UK

The Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 ended the War of Spanish Succession. It also recognized France's right to fish off the northern coast of Newfoundland, fishing rights that had survived the Seven Years War. In the late nineteenth century, Canadian lobstermen moved into French territory, setting up lobster processing factories and violating what the French saw as their exclusive right to fish off the coast. The French lodged official protests, worried about the impact of lobster traps on caplin, which the French used as fishing bait, and cod, which ate lobsters, the potential extinction of the local lobster population, and the seeming disinterest of the British Colonial Office in resolving the issue. The British argued that French fishing rights were concurrent with Canadian fishing rights, that the right to fish did not extend to lobsters because they are crustaceans not fish, and that France needed to negotiate with the Canadians. At the time however, many in England used the word *fish* to mean any animal that lives in the ocean. In 1886, a French warship destroyed a Canadian lobster factory at Port Saunders, and another lobster factory nearby in 1889. The Newfoundlanders responded with the Bait Acts, a series of laws that cut off French access to Canadian bait. The French and British maintained the dispute from 1881 until they reached a compromise, modifying French rights when they signed the Anglo-French Convention in 1904.

###Japan and the U.S.

In 1964, the [Continental Shelf Convention](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-4&chapter=21&clang=_en) (CSC), an international treaty, recognized the exclusive right of nations to the territorial waters, sea beds, and natural resources therein that extends [200 nautical miles](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/continental_shelf_description.htm) from a nation's continental shelf, known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The CSC includes *[sedentary species](https://www.oceansatlas.org/subtopic/en/c/20/)* in its definition of natural resources exclusively owned by adjacent coastal states. Fish are not included in this definition because they freely pass in and out of an EEZ. Lobsters (and crabs) defy easy categorization because while they are not embedded in sea soil like oysters or clams, they also do not swim through the ocean, they walk on the seafloor. Japanese fishermen had fished for crabs and lobsters in Alaska's continental shelf near the Aleutian Islands, so in 1964, the Japanese argued neither qualified as sedentary species. While the U.S. refrained from formally accepting that either are sedentary species, they compromised, allowing the Japanese to continue fishing in the continental shelf with annual quotas.

###France and Brazil

In the 1960s, France and Brazil had a bloodless military confrontation known as the Lobster War over whether French fishermen had the right to fish for lobsters in Brazil's continental shelf. Mauritania gained its independence from France in 1960. French lobstermen worried they would lose access to Mauritanian fisheries, which had been in a twenty year decline, and began looking elsewhere for lobsters. In 1961, four French ships crossed the Atlantic to Brazil, catching 85,000 lobsters in one month. Brazil initially granted three ships the right to fish off their coast, but dozens of ships followed, so Brazil banned foreign lobster fishing altogether. Fishermen ignored the ban, and in 1962, a massive haul of lobster prompted the Brazilian navy to start boarding French boats. The Brazilian government argued that lobsters traverse the sea floor and therefore were part of the continental shelf, which Brazil exclusively held sway over. France argued lobsters swim like fish and are therefore not part of the continental shelf. The Brazilians [suggested](https://www.vice.com/fr/article/qvg3vp/quand-le-bresil-et-la-france-declenchaient-une-guerre-pour-quelques-langoustes) that if lobsters are fish because they live in water, then kangaroos are birds because they jump in the air.

On January 30, 1963, the Brazilian government boarded and seized three French fishing boats. The French navy sent warships, including a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, to Brazil, and Brazil deployed its navy. France took the issue to the International Court of Justice, but before a decision could be rendered, in 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew President Goulart in a coup d'état. His successor, Castelo Branco, signed a deal accommodating French interests in December 1964, allowing some French lobstermen to fish for five years. In 1966, Brazil took another group of French fishermen when they illegally fished off Fortaleza. In 1969, the Brazilians expanded their designated territorial seas to 12 miles out, and in 1970, they expanded it to 200 miles from their coast.

# The present situation

Today the European Union stands as a sort of entity that is more than just a economic bloc but less than a full political federation, like the post-Napoleonic German confederation. There are of course differences that include still entrenched specific national identities, [economic differences](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gs4eo4/if_the_eu_splits_then_will_it_be_a_northern/) between the different regions, outside influence trying to keep the region divided and such. But there are also massive advantages, first of which is of course the fact that the [dominant Western establishment elite wants federalization](https://www.ft.com/content/3d0cc856-e187-11e6-9645-c9357a75844a) in order to allow the EU to become a true global political giant in its own right that would be on the same level as the US and China.

Today we are also seeing the rise of genuinely pan-European forms of nationalism being on the ascent. Primarily of two kinds, one is the more [liberal variety](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/02/huntingtons-disease-and-the-clash-of-civilisation-states) pushed relentlessly by the establishment and latter is the [ethnic variety](https://www.politico.eu/article/who-are-europe-far-right-identitarians-austria-generation-identity-martin-sellner/) seen in the various identitarian groups. And although they differ in many ways and the former is pushed by those in power while the latter is from groups aspiring to power, they converge on the same final goal of European unity. If the establishment form of pan-European liberal nationalism continues to fail to garner mass support to push for federalization, it is not at all unlikely that parts of establishment will defect and try to use pan-European ethnic nationalism as an ideological justification to rally the masses for unification. This scenario is all the more likely keeping in mind the [rapid pace at which Western European politics has been moving right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51721356) since the 2015 migrant crisis. One thing however to keep in mind is that both forms of these pan-European nationalisms are primarily found in the West, so the reactions and developments in the East would be interesting to see to say the least.

This all comes in the backdrop of a decline of individual European states on the world stage. France or Germany or Italy today are dwarved massively by the US or the rising China, creating geopolitical pressures that has helped lead them closer into a union.

# Potential unification scenarios and similarities to German unification

As mentioned above, despite massive integration between the elites of the different European countries there continues to exist an economic split between the North and the South and a more political split between the West and the East. These can potentially make the union very vulnerable and prone to collapse, especially keeping in mind potential outside interference to stop any federalization. The scenario where the US tries to exploit West-East fissures to get countries like Poland to torpedo a full federalization is not at all unlikely. Especially keeping in mind that a united Europe would be a power in its own right separate from the US, reducing the global influence of the latter by a large amount. This is something the American leadership certainly is not going to simply accept as the current arrangement where a loosely united Europe is dominated by it is the ideal scenario for Washington DC.

Keeping the above points in mind, a scenario I find particularly likely is that at the beginning there would be a federalization of old ""Frankish Europe"" as in the territories of the former Carolingian empire. This is especially likely if the Brussels establishment becomes desperate with time but the North-South and West-East divisions turn out to not be bridgeable for the time being. This ""core"" Europe, that should consist of Germany, the low countries, France and potentially Scandinavia than can play the role of Prussia, essentially expanding Southward and Eastward with time. The German unification that happened in the nineteenth century was an event of Prussian expansionism, where Prussia pushed out Austria and then proceeded to take in smaller northern and southern German states under its aegis and justified doing so through the ideological banner of German nationalism. A similar thing can happen here although admittedly future scenarios are not fully predictable.

One very important thing that can see the whole of Southern Mediterranean Euterpe be willing to be absorbed by any ""lesser"" federal EU, especially if the issue of a fiscal union with the North is resolved and France is indeed in, would be the matter of [sub Saharan climate migration](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/08/26/the-coming-migration-out-of-sub-saharan-africa/). The South would be directly threatened by this and would likely become desperate for Northern help in holding off the tide.

# The geopolitical potential of a federal EU

Any federal EU would be demographically robust, either equal to or ahead of the US and only behind a China that has entered demographic stagnation like itself and an economically backwater India. It also has robust military assets including nuclear arms in France and massive potential for a buildup.

It is hard to argue that any potential European federal state, especially if the whole of the union is unified would be anything short of a superpower. It would also under the ideological banner of pan-European nationalism have the potential to eventually absorb countries like Norway and Serbia. In a potential scenario after Putin where the Russian regime and the ruling elite becomes more amenable to Western Europe, there would remain the potential that Russia may also be absorbed which would almost certainly see Europe becoming more powerful than the US or China. A ""Dublin to Vladivostok"" state, unlikely as it is today, is still not entirely improbable and has the potential to be the premier world power. This sort of room to easily expand is something neither the US nor China has.

We should also remember climate change would be aiding Europe geopolitically, primarily by massively damaging countries to the South while boosting the profile of those in places like Northern Euterpe. It is not [just Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/16/magazine/russia-climate-migration-crisis.html) that is set to be a beneficiary of climate change.

In terms of spheres of influence, North Africa or the Maghreb is almost certain to fall under the influence of any European federal state. Sub Saharan climate migration [will existentially threaten the countries here](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gldhce/comment/fqxg8hk) as I hand written here before and thus them likely turning to aid from North of the Mediterranean to hold back the migration is likely.",geopolitics,climate change

Geopolitics, in its essence, is a machine. A complex mechanism of moving cogs, manifesting itself in the form of trade deals, territorial expansion, populism and technology. A system so thoroughly complex it’s only rival might be that of the human brain. 
 
Like it or not, the geopolitical players of the 21st century have been set, the cogs have been moved into place and the machine is running efficiently, oiled by newfound armed conflict and populist movements across the world. Now the goals of the most stable individual parts have been shifted from maintenance of their own self interest to hindering the development of their rivals.

Saying the quiet part out loud is deeply unpopular, however the simple fact of the matter is that it is in the short term interest of some nations to prevent a slowdown of climate change. Some prime examples of this would be that of Russia, Canada, and Denmark.
 
A balance must be struck, masterfully at that. Nations that have everything to gain from the habitability of the Arctic, also have everything to lose by letting these facts be known. 
 
The warming of the earth’s atmosphere, at any rate, is an inevitability by this point, the real debate lies in how much it warms, if direct immediate action is taken in preventing further burning of fossil fuels and accelerating research on carbon capture technology, then it is estimated by the United Nations a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius can be achieved from pre-industrial levels. 
Year after year with shocking consistency, the polar ice caps become more and more vulnerable, with ice shelves previously thought to be unaffected from record warmths collapsing right under this very assumption. While this is undoubtedly a net loss for the preservation of the earth's environment, there are some willing to find opportunities where once it seemed scarce. 
 
The Arctic region is one filled to the brim with rare earth minerals, some examples being Praseodymium, Terbium, Dysprosium, and Neodymium. Along with an abundance of considerably more common yet invaluable natural resources like Coal, Zinc, Iron Ore, Lead, Nickel, Diamonds, and even Sand suitable for construction. 
 
It is safe to assume for any administration willing to attempt exploitation that any measures to extract these resources on a grand scale will be deeply unpopular. Massive protests would likely ensue and the native population of the area might attempt more aggressive means of protest, or possibly even become blatant saboteurs of the project. This has been seen by different projects in Canada, The United States, Finland, Norway, and even Russia.
 
Yet those who are disproportionately unaffected by the public outcry might be more suitable to achieve this future of mineral wealth and living space. The most notable example being Russia, who is uniquely suited to take advantage of this situation, given its chokehold on information through state media and historic willingness to commit atrocities to reach goals (though this is not always without repercussions by the international community). 
 
Of course, looking at any one country’s ambitions must be viewed through the lens of the country’s history, domestic politics, international goals, and the importance of culture and nationalism in their decision making process. Sometimes the most logical decisions simply aren’t the ones taken, as it might be under the jurisdiction of one man longing for former national glory, or delusions of grandeur. So what might be geopolitically advantageous for Russia might not be as Geopolitically advantageous for Sweden, who is surrounded by the economic might of the European Union, which has taken a decidedly aggressive anti-climate change policy.
 
Is it worth it to keep shooting for ambitions if every other shot ricochets? If your country doesn’t have the political will to endure the pushback, the answer is no. 

Yet for hundreds of years the use of the Arctic has been understated and undervalued, the quintessential example of this would be, of course, the acquisition of Alaska. “Seward's Folly” as it would be called domestically, named for the man who advocated for its purchase William Seward. It was seen as unnecessary, a frozen hellscape filled with Inuit and polar bears. But in 1898, 33 years after the purchase, gold was discovered and there began yet another great American gold rush. And would become one of the greatest investments into a nation ever made.

How does this translate into modern day geopolitics? Well, there is an argument to be had that nations who simply play it safe because of domestic pressure might end up on the wrong side of history by passing on a once in a thousand years investment. 

There are no right answers, the truth is the rush for the Arctic hasn’t truly begun, we as a species are in the preparation stages, only the truly foresighted governments and intellectuals have understood the genuine monumentality this will have on the global political system. 

In theory, melted ice caps could make way for practical usage of the famed Northwest Passage, which has put the United States and Canada at odds in the past 10 years. Canada believes that because of it being within the maritime borders of Canada it rightfully belongs to them, while the United States argues it is an international trade route, and should be given such treatment. Regardless of who is right, the fact is this will put the Canadian and US governments at odds, and will drive a political wedge between two countries with a growing nationalist sector.

This alone already has a huge impact, a country with a population smaller than California potentially having such influence over the United States is fundamentally against its doctrine. 

The newfound usage of previously uninhabited lands could bring about truly gargantuan cultural and social changes. While the ice caps melt to bring about reasonable temperatures closer to the poles, nations closer to the equator and with low sea levels will have to rely on nations like Russia and Canada to absorb a massive influx of migrants. 

This, in theory, could bring about a resurgence of nativist ideology in nations that will have to take in the migrants and further ingrain nationalism into its culture and society. 

If this happens, there will likely also be an increase in global armed conflict, nations struggling to survive closest to where the water disappears will be presented with a choice, acquire resources or die. Most nations will choose the former. Extremes in ideology will become far more common than in the modern geopolitical system, as more and more desperate measures will have to be taken to ensure stability, and could provide ample opportunity for “strongmen” with big promises and sharp tongues to achieve power, a far better option over the former “bureaucratic systems.”

This brings about an obvious existential threat to the existing liberal world order, and this realization in many powerful public officials has put the fear of god in them. Which is likely the reason for the very sudden shift in policy on climate change. While a few stand to gain in the short term, everyone loses in the long term. 

Unfortunately, some cannot afford the luxury of thinking about geopolitics in the long term. Plagued by the shadow of their next election campaign, or a gun pointed at their head if they don’t appease those keeping them in power. 

The intelligent thing to do is to play both sides, strike that balance, understand the detrimental consequences of playing too far to one side of the hypothetical, even though it’s too costly to maintain the status queue. 

In the coming years, nations will be presented with a choice, everyone will be forced to choose a side, no matter how much they try to delay. You may try to hide your head in the sand, but the tide will always be there to wash it away.”",geopolitics,climate change

The lake was once quite large straddling the nations of Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, but since 1960 the surface area of the lake has shrunk by almost 90%, with that 10% remaining having to support 30 million people. The situation is causing unrest, panic and instability, and where you find instability you will always find people looking to exploit it. 

On the panel this week to discuss the crisis on Lake Chad were >>

TOMASZ ROLBIECKI - (University of Gdansk)  
VINCENT FOUCHER - (CNRS)  
JOHN CAMPBELL - (Fmr US Ambassador to Nigeria)

Each of the four Lake Chad nations view the lake in completely different ways, and each of the four has different problems radiating from the area. The Republic of Chad is the most reliant on the lake of the four, with the capital N'Djamena only 100km south of the lake. The people of Chad rely on this lake heavily for food, water and transport, but with the lake shrinking quickly competition for resources is becoming tense; with warlords taking up arms to secure parts of the lake for themselves. The French for many years have worked to keep Chad as stable as possible to prevent a bloody power vacuum, but N'djamena's grip on large parts of the country is slipping away. 

Niger also shares the lake, but the lake is 1,200km from its capital all the way across the desert. Niger is probably the least stable of the 4 Lake Chad nations, with Niameys control more akin to an archipelago of government rule than a cohesive nation. Many terrorist units such as ISIS in Africa, and Boko Haram use the areas around Lake Chad and the South-East of Niger to train and build up for strikes into Nigeria and the Niger heartland. To combat this US Africa command has based a fairly large regional drone program in the center of the Niger desert around Agadez, where they carry out reconnaissance and drone strikes usually in support of the French African forces fight against Boko Haram and ISIA.

Boko Haram came to international attention a few years ago when they kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from Northern Nigeria, and ever since the government in Abuja has been working hard to crush the terrorist unit. A few years ago they even attempted a large-scale offensive to finally break them, bringing in large numbers of South African mercenaries to inflict some serious punishments upon the Boko Haram groups. Boko Haram though was not defeated, just scattered throughout the region with operations now spanning from Mali to Chad. What was once an almost exclusively Nigerian problem is now a regional problem. 

Nigeria needs a stable North East (the Lake Chad region) for a number of reasons, the first of which being oil. Although Nigeria has quite large offshore reserves on its Southern coast, the oil in the NE would be far cheaper to extract; but also more dangerous to infrastructure with the terrorism rampant in the area. The country also sits on a religious divide with the Christians and Catholics based in the far greener south, and the Muslims based in the much dryer North. Every large scale operation Abuja launches against groups like ISIS in Africa or Boko Haram is often perceived by people living in the North as attacks on the Muslim North, ratcheting up the regional tensions. This forces the Nigerian government into this fine balancing act of pushing hard enough against the terrorist units to limit their ability to cause damage, whilst not going so hard as to alienate half of the country. The last thing anyone wants to do in any of these 4 nations is risk a civil war, which is probably the main reason these long term dictators in Chad and Cameroon receive military and financial support from Paris. The French do want to risk any sort of power vacuum, and seem to have adopted a ""better the devil you know"" policy when it comes to the region. 

The main issue through is global, with climate change quickly shrinking the available resources on the lake. The people who live off of the lake are scared, frustrated, and see nothing but inaction coming from their capitals; to these people a group like Boko Haram might seem like the only possibility for real change? 

I would love to get your thoughts on this? 

Should Nigeria ""rip off the band-aid"" and launch another all-out assault in the countries North? Should the US and France be doing more to combat terrorism in the region, knowing that if too many bodies stack up from these operations the public may demand they pull out all together? Is there something we can do to support Chad and prevent it from collapsing when the oil bubble bursts or when the situation on Lake Chad slips from N'Djamena's grasp and large scale fighting breaks out? 

In any case thanks again to the people on this sub, there were so many great sources on here when we were looking into the piece.

This article will be based on tweets, open sources and speculations from analysts of third parties. Take into considerations that no one expects the inner circle of the Kremlin to know what the original plans were and that it is way too to try to make any sense of motivations and reason. Anyone who claims they know what was going on is lying or is propagandizing one side.

**Strange beginning of the year.**

On 21 March 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu in the forest of Siberia for a weekend vacation. The picture showed a smiling President riding off-road vehicles and having a meal with Shoygu in the woods. Only three days later, the movement of troops and equipment started transporting to the Ukrainian border. It is most likely that this was the meeting where the final decision was taken, and some few analysts took notice. The whole photo-op gave the first impression that the troop build-up was sable ratling first of all. The second was the flood of pictures of equipment that went to the border. In thousands of tweets, we could see hobby analysts retweeting Russian images of military equipment, usually followed by very uninformative words like ""this is bad/this is not good"". They were spreading more fear. However, the analysts could take some clues also. Russians did not cover all the sensitive equipment they usually do and was very open about troops and equipment.

On 13 April, some researchers concluded that the war alert was over,\* and by 15th, the U.S. military command had said that the build-up had plateaued and cancelled officially the two warships they promised to send to the Black Sea. Interestingly, the documents needed to cross the Bosphorus were sent in late March, meaning that the U.S. command was only sure that Russia was showing off at some point in mid-April and made the logical decision that having the U.S. ships in the area increased the risk for a conflict.

It was at least one week where the U.S. was not sure about Russian intentions. Around this time, we saw some Western reactions, most noticeable from U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, who in harshly words warned Russia about consequences if Russia starts something in Ukraine. Several U.S., Canadian and U.K. cargo planes landed at Boryspil Airport, most likely bringing military equipment. At some point, something happened that convinced the U.S. that Russia was not planning anything that would change the world order. The aeroplanes stopped coming. Shortly after, it was back to business for the U.S., who announced their long-planned sanctions for Russia. The reader should note that the U.S still provided air surveillance over the border area with drones.

**The lack of details**

There were questions about the adequacy of the logistics present – there was a lot of front-line hardware, very openly paraded, but armies secondary logistics, fuel bowsers, ammunition depots and field kitchen was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 when Russia marched armies near the border, offensive action was ruled out due to the lack of logistics, this time around field hospitals was put up, but the fact that BBC reporter got a lock into the area showed that this was something Russia wanted to show to the world.

In Russian term, it can be a metaphor that in April the army train for whatever comes from August to October. As the mud dries and makes country road possible to drive and thousands of new conscripts comes to serve. The training is always intensified in this period, and by itself, the exercises Russia did was not out of the extraordinary, but the fact that it all happened near the border was.  As more and more forces came, they crossed another checklist on what you need for an offensive. While in 2016 the crisis was quickly brushed aside based on the logistics, this time it felt different. Just like Moscow wanted. The Russian propaganda network at that time also went overdrive with the infamous Russia-1 tv show  Вечер с Владимиром Соловьёвым /Sunday evening with Vladimir Soloyvov calling Ukraine fascists that needed be to stopped. Eventually even the Russian government put out a statement that tv shows and public debate did not reflect the government view on Ukraine.

**The Ukrainian gambit**

2021 was a year Zelensky turned around his domestic policies. He was elected in a landslide in 2019 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the country. He tried to find common ground with Russia, which resulted in a prisoner exchange programme and little else. Frustrated with the lack of compromises Russia gave, he started with a more western friendly policy. He shouts down Russian TV channels and put sanctions on Putin's man in Kyiv, Viktor Medvedchuck.  It was on his background Putin maybe decided to show who Russia was in the region.

Some analysts speculate that Ukraine pushed the situation after a schedule rotation amongst the troops in the frontline of Donbas. That Zelensky added an extra tank battalion along the border. How true this remains to be seen as it was difficult to find any sources to back this up.

As Ukraine can never hope to win in a direct clash against the Russian forces, the Peoples republics in Donbas will collapse within a short time without aid from Russia, a behemoth in armed forces. Ukraine has gone from a corrupt, ineffective army to a normal function one that put up some fight in a potential conflict, making the price for an invasion a little higher in term of blood. However, the soldiers of LPR and DPR are in all categories a militia without any navy or air force. A conflict between Ukraine and the Peoples Republic would be laster much shorter than a war between Ukraine and Russia. In that term, analysts could speculate that Russia development was a strong signal that nothing would happen with Donbas without their permission. Shoygu and Putin could see that annual testing of forces in Crimea and the western part near Ukraine was an excellent way to hit two flies with one swing.

**The Saakashvili trap**

A total invasion of Ukraine was most likely never an option. Such an operation would have demanded much more resources and would be the most significant conflict on European soil since WWII, potentially turning it into a world war. For comparison, the Yugoslavian population right before the split was 22 million, and there is 44 million in Ukraine. Casualties would have been in the hundreds of thousands only indirect fighting. It would have been the total economic collapse for Russia as the international community would have kicked it out of every international agreement such as SWIFT and FX trade. Even Germany could not have defended their economic ties with the country anymore.

The world does not simply work like Victoria 2 anymore. You can not place your troops over a neighbour country capital until you get the choice to annex. Analysts also saw the land grab theory as unlikely to happen. The water shortage crisis in Crimea is severe for Russia, but trying to take control over the dam in Ukraine costs many times what it takes to ship water or build new infrastructure. Furthermore, Some analysts noted that the **Russian national guard** does not deploy to the frontline. This unit is tasked with population control in a hostile environment and would have been needed if concrete plans were to pacify the newly acquired region. If Russia were to control the canal, it would still take years to upgrade it and protect it from Ukrainian sabotage.

What's left was then an escalation in the Donbas region. Most likely, Zelensky was warned by several people not to go into a trap like former Georgian President and now head of the Ukrainian National Reform Council, Mikheil Saakashvili. In 2008 he ordered his troops to answer the escalation in South Ossetia, which gave Russia a casus belli to invade. Ukrainian forces around Donbas did not respond to fire from snipers and held back on mortar shelling, a move that was lauded by the western world. By 21 April, the steam had gone out on the borderline while the increasingly hostile rhetoric from the Russian tv channels cooled down. With Putin's anti-climatic speech on the 21st, the crisis seemed to have peaked.

**The Belarussian**

As a side note, there was also the involvement of the Belarussian President on April 18, where here claimed the U.S had tried to coup the country and kill him. By this time we had observed some Belarussian troops in motion in the southwest part of the country, driving speculation on what the country's role in this buildup was. Furthermore, Lukashenko promised to announce a change he called the biggest of his presidency. As he was scheduled to meet Putin the day after the latter speech to the nation, it was believed and in some cases speculated that the long talked about Union State was happening. However the meeting was about nothing and the announcement was about Lukashenko giving power to the security council, where his son is an influential member if he was assassinated. In those three days between April 21 to April 23, the situation was basically over.

**Who won?**

As the crisis seems to cool down, it might be wrong to say if there was a winner and loser, more the cards have reorganized. It appears that the U.S and the Biden administration managed to play the cards right by making both Russia and China step down while giving support to Ukraine. After all, a non-war is the best success there is.  Russia has tested its infrastructure, prepared a hasty campaign for the future, and got its summit with Biden. Ukraine President Zelensky got support from Erdogan, although the foreign office later vaguely stated they were neutral in the conflict. He also got his long-awaited call with Biden and 300 mln dollar check for new weapons. Money that, if well spent, can fill in some of the weakness in the Ukrainian military. Anti-air weapons, communication equipment and navy expansions should be on top of the wish list for Kyiv.

Although the polls are not back yet, Zelensky might have got out of this with his popularity intact and a new wind to push his reforms. However, his two years as President saw a slow down in the armed forces budget. One of Poroshenko's most enormous success was the turnaround of the military.   Ukrainian and Western officials say Kyiv's more vital armed forces would increase the military cost to Russia of an incursion or invasion. Ukraine's army has evolved from a core of trained soldiers supplemented by volunteer battalions to a more professional corps, hardened by years of fighting. Still, it also demanded about 4% of the country's GDP. It was understandable that Zelensky, who was voted into the office on a domestic and anti-corruption wanted to move those resources. Now he will be forced to follow his predecessor's stance in building up the military.

However, there are some clear losers in this. Many professional NGOs and analysts used public channels to spread fear and conclude that war was imminent, while some few managed to be objective about the situation.

The other losers are the civilians in the occupied areas and around the frontline. Despite this crisis, the situation is deadlocked and Kyiv will not go back to the Minsk agreement.

# Key takeaways

Russia's Invasion of Ukraine caused the manifestation of China's worst fears:


* **China's long-term strategy to divide West ruined; its regional situation worsened.**

* The West, its allies, and even the typically-neutral have reacted swiftly, firmly, cohesively. 

* Peripheral states (e.g. Finland, Sweden) given impetus to join West. 

* Similar banding by states in Asia now more likely. 

&nbsp;

* **China placed in diplomatic lose-lose situation.**

* Weeks before, announced Russian friendship ""without limits"", desire to change global order; invasion not during Beijing Olympics. 

* Widely perceived to have at least enabled invasion. Worried about looking more culpable to West and suffering similar consequences during a critical period for their development.

* Must avoid looking like an insincere partner while not incurring wrath of West. Increased headwinds and crosswinds regardless.

&nbsp;

* **Regardless of Ukraine's outcome, China's longer-term outlook much worse off.**

* Running out of time due to demographic crises, climate change, critical resource shortages (water), end of growth spurt, festering financial malaise. These converge in a few decades. 

* Country and military not developed enough right now so would rather bide for another decade or so to reach golden window of opportunity (relative power) before confronting current order. Invasion creates more friction against development, brings controntation forward.
 
* Gains from Russian victory completely overshadowed by awakening and hardening of West and allies and regional banding. Russia's stability in question due to sanctions.

* Ukrainian victory means further instability for Russia on top of strengthening confidence in current global order.

* Either way, increased political headwinds due to perception of at least some culpability in invasion. Viability of Russia as long-term insurance against issues mentioned jeopardized due to chance of regime change. If it overtly shuts down a pro-West change, West will strike very hard. Worst-case: Russia becomes part of West.


&nbsp;

* **Due to all of the above, covert action to escalate the conflict between Russia and the West would be in China's favor, even if it causes some damage to self, as geopolitics at this level is about relative victories.**

* Dual-circulation and zero-tolerance policies in-place provide groundwork for further insulation.

* Putin portrayed as unstable and underhanded, with his nuclear forces armed, and the country cornered by sanctions--fertile ground for covert instigation. No speculation on form of covert instigation as too many options and too early to say. 

* Some other countries have similar motivations, but it's the most motivated and capable.

* Direct intervention: Very unlikely to assist Ukraine invasion; likely to try to prop up Putin or maintain favorable regime.

# ""Crisis: Danger and Opportunity"" - China's geopolitical opportunity in the Ukraine Invasion

&nbsp;

After lamenting for years the disunity displayed by the West and its allies on a wide range of issues, the swiftness, determination, and cohesion in their reactions to the Ukraine invasion is relieving; even touching. However, the economic asphyxiation of Russia has only just begun, and there's no telling what a cornered beast might do, and how third parties might take advantage of this perception to play both sides. The latent danger lurking below the surface might be greater than most, even on /r/geopolitics, realize. This conflict is the biggest opportunity in a generation for some states to reverse their flagging fortunes at the expense of the feuding factions and everyone else, and both Russia and the West would do well to be on guard against this. As there is no shortage of pundits discussing the threat of opportunistic provocateurs, this short article will focus on analyzing one major power's potential motivations and touch on the opportunities presented by the unfolding situation.

&nbsp;

Putin's actions caused the materialization of China's worst fears. On top of uniting, galvanizing, and even growing the West, it placed China in a diplomatic lose-lose situation and jeopardized its long-term insurance by making a Russian regime change a distinct possibility. In my view, virtually all unattended outcomes of this conflict do not bode well for its long-term future.

&nbsp;

A prevailing Russia would lead some neighboring countries to question the point of the West and fall deeper into Russia's orbit while shaking global confidence in the post-WWII order. Though in line with the CCP's goals, the benefits are completely overshadowed by the strategic costs of binding and hardening the West's resolve--something that has been their core strategy for many years. A Ukrainian victory would further strain Russia while having the opposite effect of strengthening the current order. Whatever Ukraine's fate, the world is left with perceptions that China had, at the very least, unwittingly enabled the invasion, and this on its own can have consequences. The fact the invasion began soon after Beijing's Olympics doesn't help, as military plans don't typically yield for sporting events; neither does their declaration of friendship ""without limits"" that would build a new global order at the start of the event. Given what's at stake for the current order, it would mean stronger headwinds from more directions at a critical period. Realizing this, Beijing is desperately trying to walk a fine line to avoid being seen as Russia's enabler or branded a fickle, undependable partner; dancing around in crosswinds, desperately holding on to its fig leaf of credibility. Its Foreign Ministry, known for its combative Wolf Warrior diplomacy that at one point caused the PLA to tell Xi that [it wouldn't ""pay the bill""](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/p0nqla/chinese_pla_unwilling_to_pay_the_bill_for_foreign/), has been reduced to a troupe of tightrope walkers and contortionists, with Putin as the eccentric ringmaster.

&nbsp;

Zooming out to the bigger picture: From their perspective, they would want to bide another decade or so since China is still fragile and vulnerable, especially relative to members of the order it openly seeks to topple as the country and its military are not yet mature. They probably planned to assert themselves most during their golden window of opportunity, but the confrontation was brought forward by the invasion. This would be a major headache on its own, but there's more: The CCP know their age of growth will soon be over; replaced by an age of climate change, demographic crises (plural), and critical resource shortages (water)--to say nothing of the festering financial ills being exacerbated by the zero-tolerance policy it's stuck with. These seem set to converge within a few decades at most, and then it'd be as if the universe was collecting on its biggest debt. Things will be rough, but at least there's a friendly northern neighbor that can be counted on to act as a like-minded strategic ally, a massive land buffer, and a source of cheap, accessible, dependable natural resources (including water). Or so it was thought.

&nbsp;

One possible consequence of this war is a regime change--a possibility reserved not just for Ukraine, but also for its invader. With Russia being economically decimated by sanctions and Putin's oligarchs getting stripped, the stage has been set for Putin's departure; and with this comes the possibility of an overhaul in governance and allegiances. In my view, one of the few things stopping Russia from joining the West [is its leadership](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/lcmxhh/the_longer_telegram_toward_a_new_american_china/gm4ccby/). Its people, caucasian and culturally Christian, naturally gravitate towards the West--at least, more so than to China. I have [for years](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/g961ry/is_covid19_a_turning_point_for_chinas_role_in_the/fpc2ygp/) thought about a Russian regime change as being one of the lower hanging fruits for dealing with China, all stemming from basic [research](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/94rvly/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_china/) done [much earlier](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/96qp0n/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_russia/), and this seems to be the future we're now heading toward. There's little the CCP can do to prevent this regime change once things go past the tipping point, as the West and its allies, now roused, would come down hard --very hard-- on any such attempt. If Russia follows its current trajectory unmolested and flips to the West, the CCP's future becomes that much more grim.

&nbsp;

The Chinese term for 'crisis' contains two words: 'danger' followed by 'opportunity'. The CCP knows it's in a bind and would be looking to make a move while the window of opportunity remains open.  A scenario that's better than the unattended alternatives is to come out on top, *relatively speaking*. Despite its growth having been derived from global trade, the country has been increasingly insular with its dual circulation strategy and zero-tolerance policy, so if the conflict between Russia and the West were to intensify without pulling in China (note the word use of the word 'conflict' instead of 'war'; not necessarily kinetic), that would be in its net favor. It is already under a lot of scrutiny and would want to avoid sanctions, so it must act covertly. And to a covert provocateur, the current situation would look like a buffet: A strongman characterized as unstable, cornered by sanctions; his country reputed to be underhanded, its nuclear forces on standby; the media in a frenzy, the internet rife with lies. All this within the first week of war, which could morph into years of resistance, while economic measures mature. Basically, the options range from ""manipulation of public discourse"" to ""economic shenanigans"" to ""false flag"" to ""suitcase nuke"" and combinations of everything in between, with proxies and intermediaries throwing off investigations just long enough.

&nbsp;  

With motive and opportunity established, people typically turn to the means to complete the triad, but I won't, simply because any speculation would just be creative writing since the possibilities are endless. I can, however, say with some confidence what *won't* happen: China will not meddle in Ukraine--providing funding and/or weapons to increase Russia's odds in Ukraine does little for its big picture while overt and costly. It's not so much Ukraine's fate that's China's concern, but Russia's. If anything they would try to prop up Putin, his regime, or an amicable successor's.

&nbsp;

I'm sure there are other states to which the logic presented in this short article also applies --they might even have stronger motivations and opportunities-- but within this subset of potential opportunists, it is China that's most motivated and poised. Hopefully all parties will remain vigilant, clear-eyed, and level-headed.

Southeast Asia is more important to South Korea than it is for China and Japan.

This post will be organized as follows

1. HISTORY
2. ECONOMIC TIES
3. PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGES
4. MILITARY AND SECURITY TIES
5. NEW SOUTHERN POLICY
6. INTEGRATION OF US INDO PACIFIC POLICY AND THE NEW SOUTHERN POLICY

Parts 1-4 will list the facts of South Korea's engagement in Southeast Asia because very few people here know about South Korea's extensive presence in the region. Once you understand this, you will comprehend the reasoning behind South Korea's New Southern Policy of 2017, why its decision to build an aircraft carrier isn't absurd. Like Japan, South Korea has to shield itself against China-North Korea in Northeast Asia, while thrusting southward to ""join forces"" with the US in the Indo Pacific.

# HISTORY

The first ""official"" exchanges between Korea and Southeast Asia [took place in 1391 when Nai Gong, an envoy of the Siamese king, arrived at the capital of Koryo˘ Dynasty (918–1392) in a mission to sound out the Korean market and to confirm the possibility of bilateral trade.](https://thesiamsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/JSS_094_0c_Cho_SiameseKoreanRelationsInLate14thCentury.pdf) However, we don't know whether it was a Chinese merchant based in the court of Siam pretending to be official envoys or an actual official diplomatic mission.

Much of what Korean officials knew about Southeast Asia was through Chinese and starting from the 17th century, Japanese official sources. Secondly, they had unofficial contacts with Southeast Asian envoys, particularly Vietnamese, during their tributary missions in China. However, starting from the mid-19th century Koreans begin to have more direct knowledge of the region, unfiltered by her two larger neighbors.

For most Southeast Asians the first widely known contact with Koreans were those who served in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War.

After the Second World war, Koreans presence was felt through their involvement in the Vietnam War. The first involvement of South Korean business in Southeast Asia was as contractors to the US military during the Vietnam War.

Roughly 320,000 South Koreans served in the Vietnam War, the second-largest foreign contingent after the United States. On the other side, North Korea sent two fighter squadrons and an anti-aircraft regiment.

The first involvement of South Korean business in Southeast Asia was as contractors to the US military during the Vietnam War, most notably Hyundai.  These contractors also involved themselves non-military US/Western funded projects. South Korean President Lee Myung Bak was a manager for Hyundai Construction on the Pattani–Narathiwat Highway in the late 1960s.

NOTE:  Here is a journal article [The chaebol and the US military–industrial complex: Cold War geopolitical economy and South Korean industrialization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/a130025p) that explains the Offshore Procurement Contracts (OPC) obtained by South Korean firms, were significant contributors to South Korean industrialization. From 1967-70, these OPC along with Us military assistance made up to 40-60% of South Korea's Gross Capital Formation. In the late 1970s, overseas construction contracts were equal to 9-11% of South Korea's GDP. . One could argue, South Korea was the real victor in the Vietnam War.

# ECONOMIC TIES

Here is a summary of South Korea economic ties in Southeast Asia

* South Korea has an FTA with ASEAN, and an individual FTA with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia.
* ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest export market after China. US$95 Billion vs $142 Billion (China) of South Korea's exports as of 2017. It will most likely become South Korea's top export market in a decade, as South Korean companies continue to shift production from China to ASEAN.
* South Korea is ASEAN's 5th largest trading partner
* South Korea's investment in [ASEAN has exceeded her investments in China over the last 7 years.](https://www.aseankorea.org/eng/ASEAN/ak_overview.asp) In 2018, [Vietnam got twice as much FDI from South Korea compared to China.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Vietnam-reaps-sixth-straight-record-year-in-foreign-investment)
* South Korea is the fifth largest investor in ASEAN after EU, Japan, China, US.

**SOUTH KOREA INVESTMENT IN ASEAN**

In terms of FDI, here are the figures for East Asian countries in ASEAN for 2018. East Asian companies invest in Southeast Asia because of proximity. cheap labor and young labor force. [Its median age is 29.1 (vs 38 years for China) and its average](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/#:~:text=The%20median%20age%20in%20China%20is%2038.4%20years) per capita income is US$4890, half that of China. The income level is like China in 2010, its median age is the same as China in 2000, the fertility rate is like China's in 1992.

&#x200B;

[In 2020, 80% of ASEAN's FDI went to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore.](https://theaseanpost.com/article/beginning-end-malaysias-fdi-dries) This is a rough estimate since many companies use offshore entities to invest. [For example, 28% of Taiwan's outbound investment went to offshore havens.](https://taiwaninsight.org/2018/04/23/taiwans-fdi-why-outflows-are-greater-than-inflows/) A lot of investment that goes to Singapore gets invested elsewhere in ASEAN.

South Korean companies started to seriously shift production from [China to ASEAN in 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/asia/south-north-korea-us-missile-defense-thaad-china.html), after the THAAD incident. [South Korean FDI to ASEAN countries totaled US$9.55 billion, compared to the US$5.8 billion in FDI to China. Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia accounted for 88.6% of South Korean FDI in the ASEAN region last year, indicating an intensifying concentration of investment in those countries compared with the 50.1% recorded in 2010](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/953789.html#:~:text=Most%20ASEAN%20countries%20were%20found,to%20their%20more%20stable%20environments.&text=The%20scale%20of%20South%20Korean,in%20the%20case%20of%20China)

About 73% of South Korea's small to medium firms investment in ASEAN is manufacturing. Vietnam takes up 2/3 of their [ASEAN investment, followed by Indonesia and Singapore](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/unctad_asean_air2016d1.pdf) (p162).

Besides export-focused manufacturing in Vietnam, South Korea has made significant investments in the Indonesian car industry and Philippines shipbuilding. South Korean companies intend to pour billions into Indonesia's auto and [EV battery](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-electric-vehicles-idUSKBN2940AW) sector. At the present moment, the ASEAN car industry is dominated by Japanese companies, and South Korean companies have very little presence.

**LARGE, GROWING AND PROFITABLE CONSUMER MARKET**

Many South Korean companies see Southeast Asia as a large consumer market. For K-pop groups, it is their key foreign market after they were ""banned"" in China in 2017.

It is even more so for Lotte, the company at the center of the THAAD fiasco. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and [Vietnam make up 58% of Lotte's overseas revenue](https://retailinasia.com/in-markets/lotte-expanding-into-southeast-asia-markets/).

Malaysia was the top contributor with 30.3 percent of the total, followed by Indonesia with 13.3 percent and the United States with 9 percent. China ranked fourth with a 7.9 percent share, down one spot from the previous year. The world’s second-largest economy was the leading source of Lotte’s overseas revenue with 25 percent in 2016.

# PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGES

South Korea is the [third-largest source of tourist for ASEAN after China and the EU.](https://asean.org/?static_post=tourism-statistics) ASEAN is the top tourism destination for South Koreans

Roughly 650,000 South Koreans are residing in Southeast Asia, with the bulk of them living in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia [Of the 868,000 foreign workers in South Korea about 30% come from Southeast Asia (p214).](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap100_m.pdf)

In South Korea, [Southeast Asians make up 1/3 of the international students vs 44% for China](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/09/south-korea-reporting-big-gains-in-foreign-enrolment/). The flow also occurs in the opposite direction, the Philippines has become an English camp for [South Korean](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-KRTB-7458) students. with [30,000 studying short-term courses in the Philippines every year.](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/09/117_51729.html#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%2029%2C155%20Koreans%20were,or%201%2C702%20students%20per%20month.&text=The%20visa%20allowed%20them%20to%20study%20degree%20courses%20in%20the%20Philippines)

In South Korea, out of 242,538 marriages in 2017, 5.4% were between South Korean and foreign women. Out of that, 40% were Southeast Asian women, with Vietnamese women making up 75% of the total.

# MILITARY AND SECURITY TIES

In the section, I will focus on South Korea's military engagement with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The first two due to their extensive South Korean arms purchases, and Vietnam due to the potential for much greater defense cooperation.

[South Korea's most extensive military ties in Southeast Asia are with Indonesia.](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR3100/RR3125/RAND_RR3125.pdf) In 2006, South Korea and Indonesia signed a strategic partnership agreement. The cooperation with Indonesia ranges from arms sales to technology transfers and defense industrial cooperation (KF-X Fighter). The scale and diversity of South Korean arms exports to Indonesia—ranging from small arms, infantry fighting vehicles, and self-propelled artillery to fighter jets and submarines—represents the most consequential aspect of its push to broaden its defense partnerships in the Indo-Pacific

The Philippines and South Korean military ties date back to the Korean War, when the Philippines sent 7420 troops to South Korea, the 4th largest contingent. In October 2013, the two sides signed an agreement deepening defense cooperation, including promoting defense industrial cooperation and military exchanges. The Philippines is the second-largest arms buyer in Southeast Asia for South Korea after Indonesia.

South Korean ties with Vietnam, both political and military, have been hampered by its role in the Vietnam War. However this difficult history—recently being reexamined for evidence of long-forgotten massacres of Vietnamese civilians and the sexual exploitation and rape of Vietnamese women— has not stopped ever-closer economic and personal ties between the two countries. But closer defense ties have been hindered by

1. The United States' Arms Embargo was lifted in 2016
2. South Korean outreach to Vietnam has elicited cooperation against North Korea, but Vietnam's price is most likely its cooperation against China on the SCS.
3. Worries about leaking of technical specifications on defense equipment to North Korea
4. Most policymakers still emphasize North Korea and Chinese/Japanese threats

[South Korea is the third-largest arms supplier in the region after the US and Russia for 2014-2018, and the region is its biggest export market (p14)](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/1912_arms_flows_to_south_east_asia_wezeman.pdf). Here is a list of South Korea's major weapons exports to the region

* Philippines. 2 Frigates, 1 Corvette (donated), 2 Amphibious transport dock,12 KAI T-50 Fighters, 18 K136 Rocket Launcher
* Thailand - 1 Frigate, 8 KAI T-50 Trainer
* Indonesia - 3 Submarines, 2 Amphibious transport dock, 2 Landing Docks, 1 Hospital Ship 3 Missile Boats, 14 KAI T-50 Light Attack Trainer, 22 Armored Fighting Vehicle, 54 155mm Artillery, 54 105 mm Artillery
* Malaysia - 2 Training Ships, 2 Offshore Patrol Vessels, 111 Armored Fighter Vehicle
* Vietnam - 2 Corvettes (donated)
* Myanmar - 100 155mm Artillery, 1 Amphibious transport dock

Many South Korean arms contract involve technology transfers

There are two motives for the arms sales. First to spread the cost of maintaining its defense-industrial complex. The second is to offer Southeast Asians an alternative to China. South Korean strategy has been to aid the rebalance without explicitly antagonizing China

Korean security cooperation with ASEAN members appears to be fueled by a perceived desire to expand the ROK’s diplomatic influence beyond the peninsula, reduce dependency on the United States and China, make contributions to reinforcing the liberal rules-based international order, play a middle power role, and find markets for the country’s defense products to sustain the South Korean defense industry,

# NEW SOUTHERN POLICY

In 2017, President Moon Jae-in launched the[ New Southern Policy](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/planning-the-future-koreas-new-southern-policy) (NSP), which aimed to elevate the country's ties with Southeast Asia and India to those with China, Japan, United States, and Russia. My view on this is given its extensive ties that had existed before 2018, second only to its ties to China, a belated admission by the South Korean government of the region's importance,

One must note all the Northeast Asian states, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have a Go South policy, whether implicit or explicit.

There are [three goals to the NSP](http://www.theasanforum.org/a-view-from-south-korea-3/)

* People Community - People to People exchanges like Tourism
* Prosperity Community - US$200 Billion Worth of Trade
* Peace Community is to construct a peaceful and safe environment in the region. Cooperation on terrorism, cyber and maritime security

What sets the New Southern Policy apart from other previous engagements with ASEAN is, in addition to economic aspects, it includes a diplomatic and military component.

NSP was to provide, as argued by Choe Wongi, Head of [Center for ASEAN–India Studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy (KNDA) in](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/choe_new_southern_policy_korea_2021.pdf)

>The NSP represents Seoul’s middle power ambition in search of greater strategic autonomy by taking on greater international responsibilities and roles that are deemed commensurate with its status and capabilities in a global society

# INTEGRATION OF US INDO PACIFIC POLICY AND THE NEW SOUTHERN POLICY

The peace component of the NSO has been large. However, in January 2021, the US and South Korea announced the i[ntegration of the Indo-Pacific Policy and NSP](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-of-america-and-the-republic-of-korea-on-working-together-to-promote-cooperation-between-the-indo-pacific-strategy-and-the-new-southern-policy/) at the margins of the East Asia Summit

>Our cooperation is comprehensive and growing.  We are enhancing economic prosperity through cooperation on infrastructure, energy, the digital economy, smart cities, and natural resources management (“Prosperity”); building a people-centered community while championing good governance by investing in human resources development and anti-corruption programs, and investing in human capital by promoting women’s empowerment, and spearheading health and climate change initiatives in the Pacific Islands (“People”), and ensuring peace and security through capacity building efforts to counter transnational crimes and drug trafficking, and promoting cybersecurity, maritime security, marine environmental protection, and disaster response and preparedness (“Peace”).

Unlike before there has been more substance recently in South Korea's attempt to seek greater involvement in regional security. First, the South Korean Defense Minister, Suh Wook, said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin

>What is protecting the Korean Peninsula is centered around the Korea-U.S. alliance, but we believe the Korea-Japan security cooperation is also a valuable asset, which is why we need to maintain this

# The Geopolitics of the Pampas

# Introduction

When you think of geopolitical conflict, South America is one of the last places that comes to mind. This continent is most well known for its coups, civil wars and general political instability left as a legacy of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule. In the alternate history community there is a running joke that South America always looks the same, even as the rest of the world is drastically changed from our world. All of this shows that the general perception of this continent is one of constant instability making it impossible for the continent’s nations to wage war against each other, because they are too busy fighting themselves. 

This however is not entirely true. The War of the Triple alliance waged between 1864 and 1870 saw Paraguay declare war on Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil in what seems like the most ridiculous scenario imaginable. However this conflict was over control of the vital rivers of the Pampas, and the balance of power in the region; with Paraguay fighting Brazil over which would dominate Uruguay. The War of the Triple Alliance was the pinnacle of the geopolitical importance of the Pampas, and it is important to understand the situation which Argentina and Brazil find themselves in, as it helps explain why South America is known for its lack of war. 

# The Pampas

To understand the geopolitical rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, you need to understand their geography, and the region known as the Pampas. Brazil is divided into the mostly backwater Amazon rainforest in the north, the densely populated coasts, and lastly the underpopulated interior between the Amazon and the coast. The coasts are the historical heartlands of Brazil as the coastal mountains prohibited settlement further inland, not to speak of the fact that much of the inner regions were too acid for growing crops, before discovering that it could be deacidified with lime. Due to the historical reality, much of the Brazilian population of over 200 million people are concentrated along the coast, with the southern region of Rio De Janeiro and São Paulo being the most developed and populated region in the country owing to Rio’s history as the capital city.

Argentina in contrast is divided starkly into the northern fertile plains and the southern Patagonian desert, with steppes suitable for pasture located between them. Due to the simple reality of climate, a majority of the Argentinian population of 45 million people are located in the north, concentrated along the Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. 

With the two countries' centers of population so close together, conflict between the two became inevitable after independence.  
 The naturally fertile region which the two countries share is located around the mouth of the Uruguay and Paraguay river is known as the Pampas. The hotbed of conflict only second to the Bolivian coast.

# The tale of two colonies

Another important piece to the puzzle of these two nations is the historical difference, most notably their colonisers. Following the treaty of Tordesillas dividing the new world between Spain and Portugal, the path was set for a division in the South American continent. Spain colonised the western half of South America, while Portugal colonized the leftover region of what would become Brazil. In time their style of administration drifted apart, as Spain kept tightening its grip on its colonies to make as much profit out of them as possible, while out of necessity the Portuguese granted increasing autonomy during their exile in Brazil. Once the two Iberian overlords were done with the Napoleonic wars, the colonial elites of South America had seen that their overlords were not invincible militarily. When Spain and Portugal tried to take back control, the colonies had enough and proceeded to declare independence, winning against their weakened overlords.   
 However the legacy of these separate colonisers is the cultural difference between Brazil and the rest of South America. Argentina speaks Spanish while Brazil speaks Portuguese. While not dramatic differences as Spain and Portugal are culturally and linguistically close, still it contributed to the difference between the two largest countries of South America.

# The delicate Balance

The reason for there being no open hostility between Argentina and Brazil is simple, geopolitical balance. The border territory that they share is flat grasslands, only broken by the several rivers running through the Pampas. With flat terrain suitable for swiftly advancing armies, distance and rivers are most essential for defensive strategy. The direct border between the two countries is limited to the 1224 kilometer long stretch of border which runs along the Uruguay river, making for a natural border. 

Uruguay acts as a vital buffer state between the two nations. If Brazil controlled Uruguay, they would be located just 40 kilometers away from Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. While it would secure Brazil’s control over the whole of the Uruguay river border, it would be an unacceptable reality for Argentina, which would no doubt do everything in its power to secure Uruguay for itself in order to defend its capital. If Argentina held Uruguay, it would place Argentinian forces to Border Brazil’s southern flank with the border on flat terrain without a large river, making Brazil’s defensive strategy obsolete. On top of this, the cities of Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio De Janeiro would no longer be behind a large river for the Argentinians, with Porto Alegre besieged from two sides should a war erupt. This would not be acceptable for Brazil, as it would not allow for its southern economic centers to be so vulnerable. Uruguay stands as the buffer between the Argeninian capital and the Brazilian southern economic centers, and as such it’s neutrality is essential for keeping the two big powers away from each other's throats. 

Paraguay sits as the second buffer state between Argentina and Brazil. While not as crucial at first sight, the length of the Paraguayan country makes it just as important as Uruguay. Lots of fertile farmlands are located along the banks of the Paraguay and Pilcomayo rivers. On top of the farmlands, Paraguay provides distance between Argentina and Paraguay, not to speak of the fact that the length of the border between the two states would more than double should either of them gain control over Paraguay. If Brazil controlled Paraguay, it would gain hundreds of more kilometers of buffer between the border and the Brazilian interior. However the length of the direct border with Argentina would lengthen by 1689 kilometers to a total of 2913 kilometers, spreading the forces of both nations thin. This would be unacceptable for Argentina strategically, as it cannot sustain as large of an army due to a significantly smaller population. On top of this, the Argentinian provinces of Misiones and Corrientes would be surrounded on three sides by Brazilian forces should conflict erupt, which would leave them vulnerable to encirclement, or force the Argentinians to leave an opening in the river defenses should they decide to pull back. If Argentina gained control of Paraguay, the Misiones salient would be eliminated, though the border with Brazil would lengthen by a thousand kilometers to a total of over 2224 kilometers. It would also place Argentine forces in a prime position to invade the Brazilian heartland, as Brasília, the capital of Brazil, would be at its closest only 1087 kilometers away from the border, with only flat farmlands providing Argentine forces with no natural barriers. It would also expose Brazil’s economic heart's western flank, allowing an Argentinian army to strike Sao Paulo from inland, instead of across the coastal mountains. This would not be an acceptable reality for Brazil, as It cannot allow Argentina to have flat terrain to invade into their capital without a large river in between. It’s almost the same distance to Brasília from the Argentine border, as it was to Moscow from the Molotov-Ribbentrop line that divided Poland, except this time there would be no snow or winter.

Paraguay stands as a mutually beneficial buffer, which allows both Argentina and Brazil to concentrate their forces along their mutual and shorter border, leaving neither side exposed on their flanks.

The current geopolitical situation of the Pampas benefits both Argentina and Brazil. Paraguay allows them to concentrate their forces on a shorter border, while Uruguay keeps both of their economic centers a comfortable distance away from each other. However should this balance be changed, the fertile Pampas might be set ablaze.",geopolitics,climate change

#General Introductions

Europe has been divided into six regions according to [this map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe#/media/File:Grossgliederung_Europas-en.svg). The region under discussion is comprised of the following nine countries (sorted by population; descending):

* Romania

* Serbia

* Bulgaria

* Croatia

* Bosnia and Herzegovina

* Albania

* Macedonia

* Kosovo

* Montenegro

&nbsp;

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below:

#Observations

* The most salient observation is that populations in the region, with the exception of the smallest countries, are projected to dramatically decline over the century, with many populations projected to be at or below 1950 levels. Most notable is Bulgaria, which is projected to see its population drop below half that of its 1950 level, while Romania, Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia & Herzegovina are set to see populations drop below their respective 1950 levels. It should be noted that these are all the most populous countries of the region.

* Based on cursory inspections of population pyramids, all but the smallest countries in the region are set to experience varying levels of difficulties with aging populaces. Looking solely at the pyramids, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania seem like they will experience the most significant problems.

* There is a relatively large amount of agricultural land in the region, with much of it being arable land. Though the sector is designated as 'one of the most affected' by many countries, the agricultural outlook is not as bleak as in many regions examined earlier. The high reliance on wheat and maize will likely be an issue, as the crops will be adversely affected by increases in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns. There will be crops that benefit from climate change. In general, it does not seem that climate change will have a significant impact on food security in general, as the region has a decent level of per capita food production. In terms of economy, Albania's is the most dependent on agriculture, with 22% of its GDP derived from it, while the region in general isn't quite as dependent, with the range being 4-12% and the median being 7.5%.

* Though water resources in the region are not notably high (none breach the 10,000 m3 per capita per year of internal renewable freshwater) and the region will generally see a decline in precipitation, the projected population decline should offset a large amount of potential water stress, though this does not mean that countries will not experience water problems, as there are many countries in which water infrastructure is not developed enough. However, that's the simplistic view--the outlook is not as rosy after factoring in an increase in demand due to development, agricultural needs, as well as increased strain due to more extreme climactic events such as floods and droughts that climate change generally causes.

#General Introductions

Europe has now been divided into six regions according to [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Regions_of_Europe_based_on_CIA_world_factbook.png) (thanks to /u/Zokuga for the pointer). There has been a slight reorganization of the region covered in the previous discussion: croatia has been added to southeastern Europe (last week's region), Greece has been moved to southern Europe (this week's), and Moldova will appear in eastern Europe (next week's). The region in red (Spain, Portugal, Andorra) has been combined with the region in light green (Italy, Greece, San Marino, Holy See) as well as Malta (considered part of northern Africa by the map, but not yet covered in this series) to reduce the number of weeks needed to cover Europe. 

The region under discussion is comprised of the following eight countries (sorted by population; descending):

* Italy

* Spain

* Greece

* Portugal

* Malta

* Andorra

* San Marino

* Holy See (Vatican City)

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that are not available in English.

#Observations

* The population of the region is projected to decline, with all major countries, with the exception of Spain, projected to see populations at or lower than 1960 levels. The extent of this decline is not as dramatic as that of Southeastern Europe, covered last week. 

* Major countries have been experiencing lower birthrates over the last three decades, which, when combined with their mid-bracket bulges, will lead to varying degrees of problems with population aging.

* Malta has a sharp and significant indentation in the 25-34 age brackets for females. Would anyone happen to know why?

* There is a good amount of agricultural land in the region--much of which are arable. Climate change is set to negatively affect existing crop production while enabling currently non-existent crop production. As there is a low amount of malnourishment in these developed countries, it is not likely that food security will be an issue. Agriculture makes up tiny fractions of these developed economies (median is around 2%), with the exception of Andorra, where agriculture contributes 12%.

* Aside from Malta, countries in the region have a fair amount of renewable freshwater per capita. Although water stress is an existing issue in some regions of some countries and climate change is expected to decrease water supply in almost all countries in the region, the water situation seems relatively stable going forward. This is because of declining populations should provide some relief while the wealth of these countries allow them to import water from places like central Africa.

* Greece is projected to be particularly affected by rising sea levels.

* It should be noted that all major countries in the region account for four of the five countries of PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain)--the most economically weak countries during the European debt crisis.

#General Introduction

&nbsp;

At 8.5 million square kilometers, Brazil is the sixth largest country by area, placing it between China and Australia. About a third of this is agricultural land, with permanent pastures taking up most of it at 24% of total land area and arable land occupying 9%. Most of the Amazon is contained within its borders, making its climate famously tropical, but the country's vast territory gives it a range of climates, including a more temperate southern region. Relevant natural hazards experienced by the country include recurring droughts in the northeast and floods in the south. 

&nbsp;

The country is relatively sparsely populated, with 209 million inhabitants (as of 2018) sharing an area that is roughly the size of the United States. With its population projected to peak mid-century at 234 million (a 12% increase), then decline to today's levels by the end of the century, overpopulation does not seem to be a problem going forward. With a 2015 population pyramid that is slightly lower-mid heavy, only mild problems related to population aging are expected. The country is predominantly white (48%) and mulatto (43%), with a sizeable black population (8%), and is predominantly Roman Catholic (65%)--a trait shared by neighboring countries that have been covered in this series. 

&nbsp;

The Atlantic coast houses the vast majority of the country's population, as shown in [this population density map](https://www.socioeconomicatlas.rs.gov.br/upload/recortes/201612/26174342_15581_GDO.png), and this has implications for the impacts of sea level rise, especially because some sources have suggested that the region will see rises higher than the global average--one study places Brazil among the top fifteen countries with increased exposure to sea level rise by 2070. 

&nbsp;

As a whole, the country is economically large, with a GDP (PPP) that's eighth worldwide ($3.2 trillion), placing it between Indonesia and the United Kingdom. However, the per capita figure is much lower, ranking at 108th worldwide ($16,000), placing it between Iraq and Algeria. The composition of its GDP (by origin) suggests that it is quite developed, with services contributing 74% and agriculture contributing 7%. The country's wealth and development do not seem to be factors that will significantly hamper mitigation of and adaptation to climate change impacts.

&nbsp;

Temperatures are projected to rise, reaching up to a 6.7 C increase by 2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario--a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario that is more likely to occur than lower-emissions scenarios. This increase in temperature is remarkably uniform across the large country, with maximum increases lower closer to the coast and to the eastern and southern extremes. A very large area of Brazil's northeastern land, covering the Amazon rainforest, is projected to experience wet bulb temperatures in excess of 32 C for five days or more per year, as shown [on this map](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coffel-figure-3-637x309.png) ([source](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/22/humidity-may-prove-breaking-point-for-some-areas-as-temperatures-rise-says-study/))--this is significant because sustained wet bulb temperatures in excess of 35 C ""is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature our bodies switch from shedding heat to the environment, to gaining heat from it"" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature#Wet-bulb_temperature_and_health)). However, [this land use map](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/sites/default/files/resize/images/LandUse-Map-EnvSciPolicy2012-400x445.jpg) of Brazil suggests that the affected region is virtually unused for agriculture, though it does contain one population center and a sizeable amount of inhabitants littered over the area. The affected area also contains indigenous tribes, some of which are uncontacted (thanks /u/Corbutte).

&nbsp;

According to the UNFCCC communication prepared by the Brazilian government, precipitation is projected to decrease by 22% in the northeastern region and in the eastern part of the Amazon while increasing by 25% in the southern and southeastern regions by 2100; while the UK Met Office and the University of Nottingham report showed a vastly different projected, with a roughly 5% increase in the western region (low agreement among models) and decreases of 5% in many other regions.

&nbsp;

According to the [Economist Intelligence Unit's Food Security Index](https://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/Country/Details#Brazil), undernourishment and food security is currently not an issue for the country as a whole, and the 7,000 - 12,000 Calories per capita per day figure from the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization supports this. However, there are international monitoring organizations, such as the International Instituite for Sustainable Development, which assert that [a third of the population is food-insecure](https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/publications/food_security_brazil.pdf) (P. 3), though the extent of this insecurity was not elaborated on. This strongly suggests wealth inequality beyond what the country's gini coefficient (~0.50) signals, which is likely to intensify with climate change.  

&nbsp;

Many major and staple crops are considered vulnerable to climate change and are under risk--according to the government, rice will see a reduction in growing area, second corn crop will be under increased risk due to water deficiency and increased temperatures, first corn crop is not as affected, soybeans ""is affected"", first bean crop ""is also affected"", and second beans crop ""is more affected than the first one"" (side note: I hope anyone reading this who goes on to write any report learns from this and writes with more substance and specificity--unless, of course, you're trying to obfuscate something). According to USAID, soybean and cotton will be moderately impacted while maize and wheat will see significant declines in yields, while the livestock and fishing industries are also at risk. The UK Met Office and University of Nottingham project lowered yields for soybean, maize, and rice, with a small increase in sugarcane yields, while bean yields alone will have negative impacts offset by increases in carbon dioxide levels.

&nbsp;

At 27,000 cubic meters of renewable internal freshwater resources per year, Brazil has a large amount of freshwater available to use. For comparison, the global average is 5,900 m3. This is in line with the average of other countries in the region that have been covered, which averages at 26,000 m3. Despite that, the vast territory of Brazil means that there is a range of climates, and of those climates, the northeast is particularly vulnerable to reduced water availability ""due to the natural climate variability, high evaporation rates and low precipitation rates associated with soils that are not very shallow, which prevent the storage of water to better regulate the flow of rivers."" This reduction in water availability may be caused by changes to runoffs in watershed areas and could affect water availability ""virtually all over Brazil"". However, it should be stressed that there is substantiall uncertainty over future drought and water stress, and that this is due to [El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation). Due to Brazil's status as a developing nation and its high wealth inequality, it is much more certain that changes in water availability will translate to localized water stress due to poor or lacking water infrastructure and a lack of political will to improve the situation.

#Observations

* With the exception of the Netherlands, countries in the region are projected to see their populations continually increase throughout the remainder of the century, with many smaller countries seeing roughly linear increases. The UK is projected to see the biggest increase in absolute terms (~15 million compared to 2018), while Monaco's is projected to roughly double. This is in sharp contrast to other European countries covered in this series, most of which are projected to see dramatic declines that will bring many populations to their 1950 levels, with many going well below.

* France and the UK have remarkably flat population pyramids that are projected to see very little change relative to other countries around the world and even to wealthier parts of Europe. This means that problems related to population aging seem mild or altogether unlikely for them. Other countries in the region also have flat pyramids relative to other comparable countries, though not to the same extent as France and the UK. The region is likely to see little-to-no problems related to population aging, which makes it stand out among developed countries and is, again, in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe.

* GDP composition by origin suggests that the region is highly developed--with the exception of Ireland (60%), countries derive 70 - 87% of their GDP from services. Countries in the region are also very wealthy, and should therefore be highly adaptive and very able to solve problems that may arise by using their purchasing power.

* As with central Europe, the high latitude of the region makes its agricultural sector less vulnerable to climate change. There is a large amount of agricultural land used in a seemingly well-balanced fashion. The increase in temperature and lengthening of the growing season will unlock new opportunities while enhancing some existing ones, but changes in precipitation and its patterns, as well as an increase in the strength and frequency of water-related problems such as drought and flooding will decrease yields. A warmer climate increasing pest and disease incidences will also negatively impact yields. Food security is not an issue for the region and is extremely unlikely to become one due to high purchasing power and a relatively positive agricultural outlook. 

* The biggest concern for the region seems to be water security--especially for water-intensive industries like agriculture. This concern seems especially pressing for the Netherlands, which has the lowest renewable internal freshwater resources per capita in the region--652 m3. The figure is also quite low in absolute terms. Generally speaking, a big cause of concern for the region is the increased precipitation extremes leading to increased risk of droughts and flooding. Some countries in the region, like Luxembourg and the Netherlands, have acknowledged that water use is increasing and is likely to continue doing so.

I started a thread to discuss the EU migration crisis in the context of climate change about two weeks ago. During the discussions, I said that [I might start similar threads to discuss how Russia and China might deal with climate change migrants](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91p63g/eu_migration_crisis_general_discussion/e323rst/). Instead, I decided to start a series about climate change in general, which I hope contributors such as /u/ZeroMikeEchoNovember, /u/cherrykirsche, /u/Dr_Gonzoh, and others who share my interest in looking at how climate change will affect the grand chessboard will find useful or interesting. 

This post is the first post in a weekly series that will serve as discussion-starters for how climate change will affect the geopolitics of various countries and regions. In each of the posts, I will provide a general introduction to the region/country (with links to credible sources), provide figures, and pose several questions. These will serve as the basic starter kits for the discussions. Because I'm just a casual dabbler in the field of IR and geopolitics, these posts are learning experiences, so bear with me. I hope these discussions will be less prone to vote-manipulation and brigading (which seems especially prevalent in recent China-related posts), which is why I was wondering if the moderators would be kind enough to put posts in this series in '[contest mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/)'.

#Geopolitics and Climate Change: China

&nbsp;

**General Introduction**

China is currently the most populous country on the planet, with a population of [1.4 billion](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=CN&year_high_desc=true) as of 2017. Its population is expected to have reached a plateau and will not see significant change through 2050, when it will begin to gradually decline, reaching roughly 1 billion in 2100, [according to the UN Population Division's projection's medium fertility variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). The country has received a [demographic dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China) from its One-Child Policy, but seemingly [must return it with interest](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2130737/why-china-must-wake-demographic-reality) as its population rapidly ages at a geopolitically-critical period when it needs to sustain its economic growth.

Since 2000, the country has been a net importer of [agricultural products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_China) due to [depletion of its main aquifers](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100713/full/466308a.html). There is [strong consensus](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19605) that [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources_of_China) is [already](https://www.ft.com/content/3ee05452-1801-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44) facing [a](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/21/asia/china-water-crisis/index.html) water [crisis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/china-has-a-water-crisis-how-can-it-be-solved/) even before the effects of climate change have truly been felt. Naturally, China has been looking to solve the problem, though whether or not the problem can be solved and whether or not the attempted solutions (like drastic geoengineering) will lead to unexpected consequences remains to be seen.

China is the [world's second largest economy by nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China), though many, including [prominent Chinese officials](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/11/02/is-china-cooking-the-books-on-economic-expansion), have stated that the numbers have been inflated and are unreliable. In contrast, China's per capita GDP is ranked 71st, indicating that China's economic strength comes from its massive population. China was the world's fastest growing economy until recently. It is currently engaged in [a massive economic and infrastructure project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) that spans the Eurasian supercontinent.

By some measures, the country is considered [a leader in science and technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_China), with some saying that it might become [a superpower in science and innovation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/these-charts-show-how-china-is-becoming-an-innovation-superpower/), though its firms and institutions are plagued with [academic dishonesty](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-science/china-issues-rules-to-get-tough-on-academic-integrity-idUSKCN1IW01O), [intellectual property theft](https://law.stanford.edu/2018/04/10/intellectual-property-china-china-stealing-american-ip/), and [corruption](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1424571/fraud-academia-killing-chinas-nobel-dream). The lack of strong fundamentals in Chinese [science](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/gauging-the-strength-of-chinese-innovation) and technology, has made it dependent on the west --especially the US-- for its core technologies, and this was exemplified by the effects of the [recent American ban on telecoms giant ZTE](https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2153618/china-reliant-us-core-technology-some-time-so-world). China excels at completing megaprojects, which is especially relevant to managing the effects of climate change.

China is currently [the largest emitter of greenhouse gases by a wide margin](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions), generating roughly double the amount of carbon dioxide than the next largest producer, the United States, despite having taken steps to reduce emissions. Climate change is expected to have a strong impact on China, as it is already struggling to meet water demands while [global water reserves continue to be depleted](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/earth-running-out-water-aquifiers/396152/), and [a very recent study from MIT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05252-y) concluded that if the world continues down the ""business-as-usual"" path, the North China Plain --the population and agricultural heartland of China-- will regularly see a [wet bulb temperature (WBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature) greater than 35 degrees Celsius, rendering it effectively uninhabitable (""A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan""), on top of affecting crop yields. China is set to see 67 million displaced by rising sea levels, 400 million potentially affected by an uninhabitable climate, and millions more who will likely be hit by abnormal natural disasters. Given the large Chinese diaspora worldwide, it is likely that China will see an increased outflow of migrants.

Historically, China has been very protective of its sovereignty, and [Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism) culture (which is the cultural core of East Asian countries) is less keen on accepting immigrants than others. This is illustrated by the ethnic makeup of Japan ([reportedly 98.5% Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Japan)), Korea ([96% Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea#Ethnic_groups)), Taiwan ([95% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Taiwan#Ethnicity)), and China ([91% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China_and_Taiwan)). With its agricultural and water supplies already under stress, it is unlikely that China will welcome any significant amount of refugees. China shares borders with many small countries and is within a short distance from many more. Of its neighbors, India is the most populous, and is expected to become the largest country by population by 2025, and one report deems it as [the most vulnerable country to climate change](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-hsbc/india-most-vulnerable-country-to-climate-change-hsbc-report-idUSKBN1GV20Z). Given its prominence in the region, it seems possible that China will face a refugee crisis, though the viable routes should make it easy to defend against (assuming western China is unviable for travel). It is unclear to this writer whether China has a strong pull factor in neighboring countries, like what Europe has in Africa and the Middle East.

**Questions:**

* What are China's prospects for solving its agricultural and water problems?

* Will China's massive population, which has been a major source of leverage for the country in business deals, act as a double-edged sword and become a major burden due to climate change?

* If the above is true, how might China deal with the problem? Would it ""cut a pound of flesh"" from itself? Would it attempt to flex its economic muscles? Would it break character and [take the now-fertile Russian land west of the Urals](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/why-china-will-reclaim-siberia)?

#General Introductions

Having two countries in a post is awkward as there aren't enough countries to justify using a spreadsheet for the introductions, yet writing full essays for each of them, like for regional powers, would be excessive--this is why I decided to write two mini-essays that will cover all of the most central points. Feel free to consult the spreadsheet linked below for more information.

&nbsp;

**Mexico**

The country's population is projected to peak around 2060, then decline. Its peak population is projected to be roughly a third larger than its current population, while its population by the end of the century is projected to be roughly 20% larger. The country's population pyramid reflects its status as a developing country, as it has a bottom-heavy profile, meaning that a large portion of the population is young. The pyramid is projected to lengthen and flatten throughout the remainder of the century and it seems likely that only very mild problems related to population aging will appear. 

Mexico has a high GDP (PPP) of $2.5 trillion, ranking 11th among all countries. Despite having a relatively high GDP (PPP) per capita of $19,900 compared to Latin American countries, more than 47% of the Mexican population lives below the poverty line. Because of the significant challenges posed by climate change, which will be discussed below, it is likely that the country's wealth, development, and wealth distribution will significantly hamper efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Agriculture is considered one of the most threatened sectors in Mexico, as the projected increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation will lead to fewer crops being as suitable for the country and to significant declines in yields of major crops like maize, beans, coffee, sugarcane, and wheat. Despite this, many studies suggest that severe food security issues are not likely within the next 40 years.

In contrast, there is broad consensus that water security will be a significant vulnerability going forward, as water deficits increase due to the decline in rainfall and the salination of freshwater reserves due to sea level rise, and depletion of aquifers. The state of Baja California, located in the country's northwest, is likely to be the most affected.    

&nbsp;

**Canada**

The country's population is projected to rise throughout the remainder of the century, with a slight deceleration around 2035. By 2100, the population is projected to be roughly 50% larger than its current figure. This increase is unlikely to put any significant strain on the sparsely populated country's resources. The country's population pyramid is relatively flat and slightly skewed towards older age groups, reflecting the country's status as a developed country. The pyramid is projected to further lengthen and flatten over the remainder of the century and it seems likely that very mild problems related to population aging will appear.

Canada has a relatively high GDP (PPP) of 1.8 trillion, ranking 17th among all countries. It has a high GDP (PPP) per capita of $48,400. As a country that's developed, relatively wealthy, abundant natural resources, and geographically positioned to benefit from the opening of the Arctic, Canada is unlikely to have trouble mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, even if the challenges posed were significant.

Climate change presents both challenges and opportunities to food producers, as the northern country's climate becomes more suitable to a larger range of crops with higher value since the growing seasons would be longer and warmer. However, this will also lead to new and increased pests and diseases. As temperatures are expected to rise dramatically in the North, inhabitants in those areas might see significant disruptions to their food supplies.

Because of the country's massive freshwater reserves, it is extremely unlikely that the country will experience water security issues even when accounting for potential reductions in the quality and quantity of water due to changes in temperatures and precipitation. However, there are concerns about the increased incidence and intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, disrupting water infrastructure and contaminating water supplies.

This post explains how lobster conservation management systems affect the relationships between the lobster industry, the Mi'kmaq people, the Wabanaki Confederacy, Canada, and the United States. Refer to [the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1IULY5DBtBiaNKbnnEGXqn2zVDUushtEE&ll=45.676682632894085%2C-67.26271444999998&z=4) for context.

##Wabanaki, Canada, and the U.S.

The [Mi'kmaq](https://archives.novascotia.ca/genealogy/mikmaq) are a First Nation people in Canada whose historic territory, Mi'gma'gi, once spanned what is now Maine, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, eastern New Brunswick, and a small portion of Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula. The Mi'kmaq [joined](http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24981.pdf) with the Maliseet, Wolastokiyik, Penobscot and Passamaquoddy First Nations in the 17th century to form the Wabanaki Confederacy, a state that extended into Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. The Confederacy defended native land claims, going to war with the British in 1688, 1702, 1722, 1744, 1749, and 1754. In 1862, the Confederation fell apart when the tribes differed in their policy towards their traditionally hostile western neighbor, the Iroquois Confederacy.^^1 There are more than [100,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/canada/canada-newfoundland-indian-status-qalipu-first-nation.html) self-identified Mi'kmaq living in Atlantic Canada today, though most do not have Indian Status, a form of legal recognition in Canada which confers economic and political rights and benefits.

###Modern revival

The foundation of Canadian-Mi'kmaq relations is the [Peace and Friendship Treaty](https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100029040/1100100029041) of 1752. In return for submission, the British government promised the Mi'kmaq that they would ""not be hindered from, but have free liberty of Hunting & Fishing."" For more than two hundred years the Canadian government effectively ignored the treaty's terms, but that changed in 1985. In 1980, RCMP officers arrested James Marshall Simon, a Mi'kmaq man in Nova Scotia who had been hunting out of season without a license outside of a reserve. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in *[Simon v. The Queen](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1985/1985canlii11/1985canlii11.html)* (1985) that the treaty is valid and its obligations are enforceable, protecting the right of Mi'kmaq people to hunt and fish. In 1986, the Grand Chief of the Mi'kmaq created Mi'kmaq Treaty Day, a holiday meant to mark the 1752 treaty and reassert Mi'kmaq rights, but provincial and national political leaders ignored the event. Nova Scotian Premier Donald Cameron ended the boycott and attended Treaty Day in 1992,^^2 and in 1993, representatives of the five original tribes [re-established](https://nbcc.ca/indigenous/did-you-know/wabanaki-confederacy) the Wabanaki Confederacy. In 2008, tribal authorities went a step further when the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs met at Province House in Halifax on Treaty Day and [proclaimed](https://www.mikmaqrights.com/uploads/procmediaadvisoryOct108.pdf) the nationhood of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia, reviving their claim to Nova Scotia's lands and waters.

###Fishery management

####R. v. Marshall

Governments throughout North America conserve threatened species by placing limits on the time of year when fishing and hunting are legal (open and closed seasons), the physical size of a hunted or fished animal (like the size of a lobster's carapace), the number of animals an individual hunter or fisherman can catch (catch limits), how many animals a hunter or fisherman can have on his person at any given time (possession limits), who can fish and hunt (licensing), and the means and methods used to fish and hunt. In 1993, RCMP officers in Nova Scotia arrested Donald John Marshall, Jr., a Mi'kmaq man who caught and sold 210 kilograms (463 pounds) of eels. Marshall, son of then-Grand Chief Donald John Marshall, Sr., first gained notoriety when he was [convicted of murder](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-life-and-death-of-donald-marshall-jr/article4283981/). He spent eleven years in prison before the court overturned his conviction, exonerating him entirely in 1990. Three years later, Marshall used a forbidden net out of season and without a fishing license to fish for eels in a test case of Mi'kmaq treaty rights. After six years of appeals, in 1999 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in *[R. v. Marshall](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii665/1999canlii665.html)* that the Halifax Treaties of 1760-1761 between the Wabanaki tribes and King George II of England not only recognized the right of Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and Passamaquody peoples to hunt and fish in order to maintain a ""[moderate livelihood](http://archive.macleans.ca/article/1999/10/11/lobster-wars),"" but that the Canadian government cannot restrict these positive rights.

The court's ruling built on *[R. v. Sparrow](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii104/1990canlii104.html)* (1992), which found that indigenous fishermen are entitled to fish all year round while maintaining existing seasonal limits for non-indigenous fishermen. These rulings are complicated by Nova Scotia's border with Maine. Maine has no seasonal limits on lobster fishing and Wabanaki Status Indians can freely cross the international border, leaving non-indigenous Canadian lobstermen at a competitive disadvantage with both their immediate neighbors and their international neighbors. Wabanaki fishermen believe that Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the governing authority that manages Canada's fisheries, has [no authority](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2000-08-26-0008250743-story.html) over them, but the Supreme Court clarified in *[Marshall No. 2](https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/fishing/marshall.html)* (1999) that Canada can impose limits in the interest of conservation or safety provided the government respects the indigenous right to their treaty-protected livelihoods and consults with indigenous authorities before imposing such limits. The difference between a ""moderate livelihood"" and commercial lobstering is [still largely undefined](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/assembly-first-nations-special-assembly-fisheries-legislation-1.4643930).

####1992 Cod collapse

Atlantic Canada is acutely sensitive to the risk of overfishing because of the 1992 cod collapse. For centuries, cod was the most valuable fishery in Atlantic Canada, but the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) overestimated cod stocks and mismanaged the industry, allowing too many fishermen to fish too many cod in environmentally destructive ways, particularly deep-sea trawling. In 1992, the population of cod suddenly declined to [1%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40252481) of its estimated population in the 1980s. The government instituted a 'moratorium' on cod fishing that is still in place today, which cost [30,000 people](https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium-impacts.php) their jobs in the largest layoff in Canadian history. When the cod population collapsed, Atlantic Canada had the lobster fishery to fall back on for employment, tax revenue, and sustenance. The cod population never recovered, and today Mi'kmaq have no alternative fishery to reply upon if the lobsters die out. Lobster fishing alone makes up [44%](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191011155319.htm) (2016) of Atlantic Canada's entire commercial fishery.

####After Marshall

In 2000, non-indigenous fishermen in New Brunswick retaliated for their perceived exclusion under the *Marshall* decision by setting 4,000 lobster traps and a Mi'kmaq prayer site on fire in the Burnt Church reserve. Indigenous fishermen responded by [burning down](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2000-08-26-0008250743-story.html) a white fisherman's house and pickup trucks. In August 2000, the DFO and police officers carried out an enforcement operation in Miramichi Bay, seizing 900 lobster traps suspected of use in illegal commercial lobstering. One hundred officers in 22 boats faced off with Mi'kmaq lobstermen on 14 boats. The officers rammed and sank two Mi'kmaq boats, injuring the fishermen on them who had to swim to shore. Other Mi'kmaq fishermen threw [blunt objects](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/03/sandrajordan.theobserver) at the police, who responded by beating and macing them. The DFO offered the Mi'kmaq [C$2.3 million](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nova-scotia-lobster-war-rages-as-native-fishermen-defy-law-711295.html) ($1.7m USD/€1.57m) to compensate for the damage, but the DFO wanted Burnt Church band members to agree to a limit of 40 traps per person when the band had asked for 5,000 per person. The Canadian government has since spent [C$600 million](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/shipment-of-lobster-seized-at-halifax-airport-fisheries-spokesman) ($455m USD/€411m) in fishing gear and licenses through the [Atlantic Integrated Commercial Fisheries Initiative](https://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/aboriginal-autochtones/aicfi-ipcia/index-eng.html) to support Wabanaki fishermen. In return for the assistance, each band council signed their own agreements with the DFO, pledging compliance with conservation measures.

###Mi'kmaq-DFO tension today

Tension and resentment endure today as Mi'kmaq assert their right to fish lobsters and manage conservation without the Canadian government's assent. For the last several years, Wabanaki fishermen have lost lobster traps and boats to vandalism, sabotage, and [arson attacks](https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2019/10/14/arson-suspected-in-destruction-of-nova-scotia-first-nations-fishing-vessel/). Canadian authorities seize illegal traps and other fishing gear from Mi'kmaq fishermen who violate conservation management limits. Non-indigenous fishermen [protest](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/10/17/news/unfinished-business-fuels-tensions-nova-scotias-aboriginal-fishery) in front of DFO offices while DFO officials worry Wabanaki lobstermen may try to occupy their offices. Mi'kmaq fishermen have alleged that there is a [conspiracy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/stonehaven-fishermen-first-nations-lobster-tension-1.3294575) to plant illegal, undersized lobsters in their boats. Others accuse the DFO of [racial profiling](https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/local/first-nations-fishermen-sue-dfo-297306/) and [accuse](https://aptnnews.ca/2016/11/18/mikmaq-are-conquered-people-says-nova-scotia-government-lawyer/) Nova Scotia's provincial government of racism. The provincial government [is arguing](https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/provincial/supreme-court-of-canada-could-hear-conquered-people-case-mikmaq-law-professor-345793/) in a legal dispute over a natural gas pipeline that Mi’kmaq are a ""conquered people,"" the 1752 Treaty is null and void, and no one has any special rights to hunt or fish in Atlantic Canada. 

In recent years, the DFO has tried to crackdown on noncompliance with the commercial lobster licensing system. Listuguj Mi'kmaq First Nation fishermen are [catching and selling](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/listuguj-mi-kmaq-first-nation-fall-lobster-commercial-licence-1.5295645) lobsters caught in in Chaleur Bay without fishing licenses. Mi'kmaq Sipekne’katik First Nation fishermen are [catching and selling](https://kukukwes.com/2019/09/24/a-mikmaw-fisherman-is-fighting-the-same-fishery-charges-his-father-faced-20-years-ago/) lobsters caught in St. Mary's Bay and [Annapolis Basin](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/indigenous-fishery-digby-commercial-lobster-1.5308376) without fishing licenses. In 2017, DFO worked with the Canadian Coast Guard in [Project Magnet](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dfo-first-nations-lobster-fishery-investigation-black-market-1.4846705), an undercover sting operation to interdict black market lobsters before they could be illegally smuggled to China. DFO officers tracked wild lobsters with [microchips](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dfo-first-nations-lobster-fishery-investigation-black-market-1.4846705) and intercepted a shipment of C$50,000 ($37,920 USD/€34,258) worth of illegal catch before it could be shipped.

##Maine

Wabanaki authorities have also clashed with the state government in Maine. Maine's House of Representatives granted a non-voting representative to the Penobscot Nation in 1823, the Passamaquoddy Tribe in 1842, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in [2012](https://legislature.maine.gov/lawlibrary/tribal-representatives-to-the-maine-legislature-1823/9257/). Another Wabanaki tribe, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, is recognized by the state and wants its own representative in the House but has thus far been rejected. No other state legislature has tribal government representatives, but the Houlton Band's newfound representation inspired the Cherokee Nation to [appoint a delegate](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/d0egv8/the_international_significance_of_the_cherokee/) to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019.

Both the Penobscots and Maliseets are boycotting the state legislature, and all three Wabanaki tribes have had on-again, off-again boycotts, partly over fishing disputes. In 2013, Maine conservation officers tried to take illegal fishing gear from Passamaquoddy fishermen fishing for eels. The officials withdrew [after a standoff](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-baby-eel-2017-story.html) with the armed fishermen. In 2015, the Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe [withdrew](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/after-150-years-penobscot-nation-cuts-ties-legislature) their representatives from the House after the state [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/26/penobscot-passamaquoddy-withdraw-maine-legislature) [fyke nets](http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/226/en), which are used to fish for eels. The Passamaquoddy Tribe refused to comply with the emergency rule and previously refused to comply with catch limits. The Penobscot Nation claimed the Penobscot River, [suing](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/12/08/just-1-tribal-official-bound-for-augusta/) the state unsuccessfully in federal court.

In 1980, the tribes [agreed](https://www.apnews.com/05372147e8b845db9ec74df0f1d464b3) to comply with Maine laws except in cases of ""internal tribal matters"" in the [Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act](https://www.maine.gov/legis/lawlib/lldl/indianclaims/index.html) of 1980. The Passamaquoddy Tribe had claimed sovereignty over 12 million acres, but in the settlement they gave up this claim and agreed to a relationship with the state similar to that of Maine city governments. Tribal authorities now want [total control](https://wgme.com/news/local/tribes-could-get-more-fishing-court-and-gambling-rights-in-changes-to-landmark-settlement) over land, fisheries, and natural resources, as well as greater control over gambling, civil and criminal jurisdiction, the right to set their own water quality standards, and to deny Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife personnel access to tribal lands to conduct fish surveys. Maine's Governor made some concessions, but has not granted tribal authorities any of their core demands.

##Minimum catch sizes

###Historical background

Every few years there is a sudden, massive decline in the Atlantic lobster population, triggering extinction scares, only for the population to rebound to new peaks within a few years. This phenomenon has occurred since the inception of the commercial lobster industry in 1856. Lobsters have a natural survival rate of one tenth of one percent. A berried (pregnant) lobster is lucky if two or three offspring of ten thousand laid eggs survive to adulthood. As lobsters age, they grow physically larger and are more likely to have mated. Early conservation measures thus focused on protecting lobsters who have not yet reproduced. In 1872, an extinction scare and lobbying from the canning industry convinced Maine's legislature to [ban](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/05/23/maines-best-known-industry-is-being-pinched) the fishing of berried females. In 1874, canneries successfully pushed through a minimum catch size of 10.5 inches (266.7 millimeters) for six months per year, and in 1875, the crisis seemed to abate. But the Atlantic lobster fishery continued to suffer extinction scares or genuine mass die-offs in 1880,^^3 1884-1885,^^4 1890,^^5 1895,^^6 1906-1907,^^7 ^^8 1914-1918,^^9-15 1920,^^16 and most recently in 1999^^17 and 2019.^^18

When the first conservation law was passed in 1872, the international border did not provide a source of significant friction because lobster canneries in Canada were largely owned by Americans across the border,^^19 but these laws pitted canneries against the upstart live-lobster industry as well as other U.S. states.^^20 Lobstermen caught illegal, undersized lobsters in the Gulf of Maine and smuggled them on railroads to New York, which had no minimum catch size,^^21 from the 19th to the 20th centuries, undermining Maine's conservation management system. Canada's Maritime Provinces, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire all adopted Maine's 10.5 inches (266.7 millimeters) standard in 1895 (and Rhode Island set a minimum of 10 inches/254 millimeters), but Connecticut undercut the transnational consensus by setting their own minimum size at 6 inches (152.4 millimeters).^^22

###Catch and release

Lobstermen have no fail-safe way to filter undersized lobsters from their lobster traps. When traps are retrieved, lobstermen have to measure lobsters by hand, using a Lobster Measuring Gauge tool to determine which are too small and which can be sold commercially. They liberate (release) undersized lobsters and bycatch, fish unintentionally caught in lobster traps, by tossing them back into the ocean. But undersized lobsters that are thrown into the ocean are [often consumed](https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/03/12/black-sea-bass-gobbling-lobsters/) by other fish like the black sea bass before they even reach the seafloor. Releasing undersized lobsters upon a fisherman's return to shore might mitigate this phenomenon, but merely possessing undersized lobsters is a civil offense. The Canadian and American governments assume anyone caught possessing large numbers of undersized lobsters intends to sell them illegally. If juvenile lobsters are consumed before they touch the seafloor, then minimum carapace laws do not accomplish anything. The DFO and the NOAA need to determine what percentage of undersized catch and bycatch survive catch and release.

###Districting theory

There is less standardization today than there was in 1895, though regulations are considerably more byzantine. The minimum carapace size allowed in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey is [3.375 inches](https://www.pressherald.com/2011/07/11/new-size-laws-squeeze-maine-lobster-dealers_2011-07-11/) (85.725 millimeters), but the minimum size in Maine is 3.25 inches (82.55 millimeters) while the minimum in Prince Edward Island is just 2.87 inches ([73 millimeters](https://www.journalpioneer.com/news/local/fisherman-fined-for-undersize-lobster-in-north-lake-pei-337971/)). New York and Connecticut, the destinations for smuggled Maine lobsters a century ago, have now effectively banned the importation of lobsters that are legal in Maine.

The U.S. federal government sets minimum and maximum carapace size limits on top of state limits across seven designated [Lobster Management Areas](https://archive.fisheries.noaa.gov/garfo/regs/infodocs/lobsterinfosheet.pdf) with three different standard minimums and maximums. States control the waters three miles out from shore while the federal government controls the Exclusive Economic Zone, 3-200 miles out from shore. The Canadian federal government sets its own minimum carapace standards across 41 designated Lobster Fishing Districts each with their own open and closed seasons. Beyond the 200 mile limit is international waters. Fishing authorities in Canada and the U.S. set different limits for different fishing areas based on the idea that lobsters in colder waters grow more slowly but when the cold water-lobsters are allowed to grow, they ultimately grow larger. There is a general preference throughout the lobster industry for larger lobsters, though canned lobsters are valued for their sweeter taste. The larger a lobster, the greater its protein content and thus the greater its market value. But lobstermen do not want to risk waiting for lobsters to grow, only to lose valuable catch to predation or disease. When state minimum catch sizes conflict with federal minimum catch sizes, whichever size is more stringent (the larger size) is applied. There are three problems with this conservation management system.

####Lobsters are migratory

First, lobsters are migratory animals who freely pass through multiple fishing areas, going north and south, closer inland and to deeper waters. Some will travel up to [1,448 kilometers (900 miles)](https://mlcalliance.org/all-about-lobster/lobster-101-habitat/) in a year. Most are thought to only travel a few miles, but no effort has been made to tag and systematically study the movements of the Atlantic lobster population. No one can say with great confidence how far lobsters are migrating over a year or more importantly over a ten year period. What was once perceived as mass die-offs may have instead been great migrations into deeper waters. In 1975, scientists [tagged and released](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f85-030#.XcOo5797n_S) more than 4,000 lobsters over a three month period. The experimenters recovered about one in ten of the tagged lobsters over the next five years. Almost one in five of the recovered, mature lobsters were found more than 92.6 km (50 miles) from the original release site. Originally released in Nova Scotia, many of the lobsters were found south in the Gulf of Maine.

####Temperatures are not static

Second, the temperature in the Gulf of Maine and surrounding waters is not static, it is cyclical, and the [Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/atlantic-multi-decadal-oscillation-amo) climate pattern is difficult to predict. There are crests and peaks in sea surface temperature about every ten years on top of 60-80 year period shifts. The temperature may be peaking right now, so there may be a general lobster migration *south*, not north as so many American lobstermen have feared, within a couple of years. Small changes in temperature affect lobster growth, mating, and migratory behavior, but these associations are not linear. There is a complex interplay of a dozen factors (like availability of prey, sediment grain size, size of breeding grounds, exposure to pollutants like oil and gas, etc.) that affect how large a lobster will grow and how many viable offspring it will produce. If temperatures continue to rise, rather than dying out, lobsters may produce '[super lobsters](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121378547)' that are 50% larger than the average caught in the Gulf of Maine today. Alternatively, anoxia, pockets of oxygen deprived water associated with higher temperatures, may actually kill great numbers of lobsters.

####Canning versus live lobsters

Third, having different legal minimum sizes in different jurisdictions encourages smuggling, the formation of a black market, and inter-jurisdictional resentment. In 2012, New Brunswick lobstermen [physically obstructed](https://bangordailynews.com/2013/01/30/business/canadian-lobstermen-feud-over-what-size-lobster-customers-want/) trucks trying to import American lobsters into Canada. The legal minimum size limit for New Brunswick, 72 millimeters, was too small for NB lobstermen to legally export to the U.S., but the American lobstermen can export their lobsters to Canada. The live lobster industry is contending with canneries just as they did in 1874, but this time the live lobster industry in New Brunswick is pushing for more stringent regulations (larger minimum sizes) while the canneries in Prince Edward Island, which mostly export to China, want to maintain the status quo.

###Conclusion

The [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/about-us/program-overview) is an [interstate compact](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/interstate-compacts/us.php) that works with the New England Fishery Management Council and various industry stakeholders to advise the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the American body that manages America's fisheries, on rule-making and management, but there are no representatives from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, or the Wabanaki tribes.

Conservation measures implemented in Canada - like seasonal fishing restrictions - are undermined when they are not enforced in Maine. Measures implemented in one U.S. state but not in Canada, like robust minimum catch size restrictions, are undermined. Effective conservation management requires community buy-in with inclusive decision-making, acknowledging Mi'kmaq-Wabanaki treaty rights or they will continue to violate the measures on principle.

NOAA has suggested studying lobster migration in a small area over the course of a year, but that is not enough to understand how temperature and other factors are actually affecting migration. Tagging lobsters with GPS tracking devices and studying their movements, preferably over a ten year period, will allow conservationists to determine how isolated lobster stocks actually are and whether previous stock counts under-counted lobsters who migrated into the deeper ocean.

Twenty years ago the ASMF Commission treated the lobster population in Southern New England (SNE), Georges Bank (GBK), and the Gulf of Maine (GOM) as distinct lobster stocks, with Southwest Nova Scotia (SNS), Lobster Fishing Area 34, as a fourth stock outside of U.S. government jurisdiction. The Commission now treats the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank as one stock, GOM-GBK. All of these stocks have a common genetic relationship, geographic distribution, and movement pattern. The state must treat these stocks not as separate lobster colonies but as a stock complex, one great biological unit requiring one conservation management system.

Note: I am not familiar with Southeast Asian relations, so my questions may not be engaging. Please feel free to pose questions of your own in the comments.

* Many countries in Southeast Asia are still developing and are expected to see their populations continue to increase linearly until 2050, when the effects of climate change will begin to truly present themselves. Most of these countries are ill-equipped to adapt to these effects and will be hit hardest. Will their membership in ASEAN substantially cushion the impacts of climate change? Will East Timor, which is the only country in the region that is not an ASEAN member, finally join the organization out of necessity?

* [Most fish and other seafood in the region have been labled 'fully exploited to overexploited'](http://www.fao.org/newsroom/common/ecg/1000505/en/stocks.pdf). Due to overfishing and changes to the ocean environment, the situation is very likely to deteriorate, and fishermen will likely clash over precious territory. Will this escalate into government-sanctioned conflict? Will this intensify dispute over China's vast claims in the South China Sea?

* With the significant internal and external challenges faced by Southeast Asian nations over the next century, what are the chances of an EU-style unification of Southeast Asia based on ASEAN? (This fanciful question was included purely for the sake of discussion)

Bnagladesh a country that has 50,000 - 200,000 Balngadeshis moving from the cities in the south to a heavily populated Dhaka where many families live in flood-prone areas. We have already seen migrants trying to reach Australia seeking asylum just to be sent to containment camps in Papua Nea Guinea and Nauru. This was an outright violation of human rights and nothing was done about it. 

When people are forced to move away from their countries due to natural disasters, should they have the same international rights as refugees? This may be helpful for displaced families to seek asylum in other countries but it may weaken the refugee status, as said by a representative of the International Organization for Migration (OIM). We need to shed light to forced migration due to climate change and natural disasters so countries, their representatives and the United Nations can tackle this problem before its too late.

>When the Biden  administration came into power last month, it had high hopes for  restoring the transatlantic alliances that had frayed in the tumult of  the Trump years. “America is back,” Joe Biden insisted in his first  foreign policy speech as president, and would “rebuild the muscle of  democratic alliances”.  
>  
>Yet  just weeks into the Biden presidency, these hopes have already dimmed.  Officials are said to be deeply disappointed with their European allies,  who have been keeping their distance and showing an unwelcome affinity  towards China.  
>  
>The  administration’s early geopolitical travails and frustration with the  EU may have unexpected benefits for one country: Britain.  
>  
>Brexit and Boris Johnson were held in low esteem by Biden and his allies before assuming power, but Britain’s increasingly firm stance on China and thirst to prove itself a useful and energetic ally have won back some ground.  
>  
>“Some  people advising Biden wanted to downgrade relations with London because  of the Trump-Boris bromance and Brexit,” said Erik Brattberg, director  of the Europe Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International  Peace. “But there’s a lot of appreciation in DC about the new foreign  policy signals coming out of London about taking on China, about climate  change. They are encouraged by the UK’s approach so far.”  
>  
>By  contrast, one Biden foreign policy adviser described sentiment towards  their European allies as “irritated and frustrated”. The adviser added:  “There is frustration and impatience with the positioning of the EU and  Germany, particularly over China.”  
>  
>Biden  officials are particularly annoyed by the trade deal that the EU has  struck with China, strengthening commercial ties between the two powers  and offering little in the way of sanction for [China’s human rights abuses](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/joe-biden-raises-human-rights-abuses-in-first-call-with-president-xi-of-china-36gmdwvg7). This was done despite protests from the incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.  
>  
>Further  alarm bells rang in response to a speech by the German chancellor,  Angela Merkel, at the end of last month in which she told the World  Economic Forum at Davos that she wished to avoid the “building of blocs”  and indicated that Germany was not inclined automatically to take  America’s side against China.  
>  
>There  is yet more concern about the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between  Germany and Russia, which the Biden administration is worried will  deepen European dependence on Russian energy. Biden described it as a  “bad deal for Europe” and is weighing up sanctions for any foreign  companies involved in the pipeline.  
>  
>Last  week, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, defended the  project by arguing that his country owed Russia a debt of guilt for the  atrocities of the Second World War.  
>  
>It  is fair to say that things haven’t quite gone to plan for Biden as far  as Europe is concerned. One recent and widely shared piece in the  influential Foreign Policy magazine was titled plaintively: “America is  back. Europe, are you there?”  
>  
>The  article continued: “The window of opportunity for reinvesting in the  transatlantic relationship is not indefinite. It is time, dear allies,  to get your act together.”  
>  
>Team  Biden may have been a little presumptuous, Brattberg pointed out.  “There was an expectation that by coming in and declaring ‘America is  back,’ others would fall in line and rally behind American leadership,”  he said. “But when it comes to the transatlantic relationship, maybe  they didn’t take into account the huge amount of distrust in US  leadership.”  
>  
>This  week, Biden will give his first international speech as president to  the Munich Security Conference, further evidence of his enthusiasm to  bring Europe back to the bosom of Washington. Yet the buzzword in  European policy circles at the moment is “strategic autonomy”, which in  layman’s terms means being less dependent on the US, particularly when  it comes to military matters.  
>  
>“Europe  is hedging its bets,” the foreign affairs writer Robert Kaplan said.  “There has been significant reputational damage done by Trump. Not so  much because of his policies but his demeanour. The visuals coming out  of the Capitol Hill riot were reputation-destroying. And once you lose a  brand, it is hard to recover it.”  
>  
>British  diplomats, meanwhile, have been pushing the message that, while some in  the Biden team may prefer to deal with Brussels and Berlin, it is  Britain that is best positioned to help them get things done. Although  it is, of course, early days for the Biden administration, which still  harbours lingering mistrust over Brexit, there is some indication that  this argument is resonating.  
>  
>“Even  outside the EU, the US can still make use of Britain as a kind of  interlocutor with Europe,” Kaplan said. “If there is a war somewhere, a  military confrontation, Britain has always been closer to the US.”  
>  
>As  promised, the Biden administration has been quick to make strong  statements on human rights issues, such as the imprisonment of Alexei  Navalny in Russia. But beyond the rhetoric, America’s European allies  are also concerned about how much time and energy the administration  will actually devote to being the world’s policeman, given the huge  challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and its attendant economic  slump. The chaotic conclusion of the Trump years also exposed the  fragility of America’s own democracy, which helps to explain European  interest in strategic autonomy.  
>  
>“You  have to have some degree of realism about the bandwidth,” Sir Nigel  Sheinwald, a former British ambassador to Washington, said. “Biden has  to put domestic policy and the unity of the country first, because  without that there’s absolutely no chance that America will have the  will, the patience, the resources to become a \[dominant\] international  player once more.”  
>  
>He  added: “America is still indispensable for doing much in the world. I  don’t think Biden will shirk his international responsibilities, but the  rest of the world will have to realise that they are inwardly focused  for the time being. There’s limited capacity for major international  initiatives.”",geopolitics,climate change

This series will examine the first-order (direct) impacts of climate change on countries--how climate change might affect food and water security for countries. The main goal here is to get a big-picture overview of the situation. A second series that will examine second-order (indirect) impacts has been announced and will start sometime after the conclusion of this series.*

*In every post, I provide a general introduction to the region, as well as some broad observations--these will serve as the basic starter kits for the discussions. Because I'm just a casual dabbler in the field of IR and geopolitics, these posts are learning experiences, so bear with me and do me a favor by pointing out any errors you might find--preferably backed by credible sources.*

#General Introductions

The region under discussion is comprised of the following nine countries (listed by population; descending):

* Germany

* Poland

* Czechia

* Hungary

* Austria

* Switzerland

* Slovakia

* Slovenia

* Liechtenstein

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* Populations in the region are projected to decline, with all major countries projected to see populations at or below 1950 levels. The decline is not as pronounced in smaller countries. Switzerland is the exception to the European norm, as its population is projected to increase linearly throughout the century, reaching roughly 125% of its 2018 population by the end of the century. The region is projected to experience problems related to population aging, though the extent of the problems are not as severe as those projected in southern Europe.

* The region is developed and very wealthy--the countries with the lowest GDP PPP per capita are Poland and Hungary, tied at $30,000. Agriculture accounts for only tiny fractions of national GDPs and services dominate with 60-70%. This high wealth allows for high adaptability and the ability to purchase resources it needs.

* The main (and often sole) natural hazard faced by countries in the region is flooding, which will be exacerbated by increased strength and frequency of precipitation extremes and extreme climactic events, as well as a rising sea level.

* The region's renewable freshwater per capita is relatively low, with the four most populous countries each having less than 1,500 m3 per year. Hungary's is the lowest, at 608. There seems to be a declining trend in the region's water consumption that is tied more to high development leading to policy and industry efficiency than to population decline. Broadly speaking, the region does not seem to face substantial water shortages going forward. One notable feature of the region is the amount of freshwater stored as glacier in the Alps--the temperature rise is projected to lead to an increase in water flow around the middle of the century as the ice melts, then a decrease as the ice is depleted.

* Per capita food production (by Calories per day) is moderately high, with most countries, accounting for roughly 90% of the region's population, at or above 7,000 - 12,000 kcal/cap/day. There is no shortage of agricultural land in the region, and there seems to be a healthy mix of arable land and permanent pasture. Climate change is likely to decrease yields of some existing crops through the usual mechanisms, with the main risks being water shortage and flooding, but the relatively high latitude of the region means that a rise in temperature will unlock new agricultural opporunities while enhancing existing ones. The most pressing problems can be solved through techniques and technologies that wealthy and developed nations can easily implement.

33,Could Israel help mitigate the impending showdown between Egypt and Ethiopia?,102.0,7s0pf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7s0pf9/could_israel_help_mitigate_the_impending_showdown/,68.0,1516570329.0,"As some of us may know, Egyptian-Ethiopian ties have been severely strained of late due to the massive Hydroelectric dam Ethiopia is creating on the Nile. Although the dam will greatly increase the country's energy output, and help enrich the struggling East African nation, it will come at the cost of nearly 25% of Egypt's water supply for several years as the reservoir fills. The diplomatic situation has gotten so bad that, several years ago, former Egyptian Prime Minister Morsi was caught on mic openly questioning the possible effects of a pre-emptive military strike on the dam. More recently, Sudan has gotten involved as the country geographically between the two regional powers, and has reignited a historic border dispute with Egypt, its northern neighbor.  
  
Enter: Israel. Since 1979, it and Egypt have enjoyed cordial, though often cold, diplomatic and economic ties thanks to the Camp David Accords. However, since Sisi's Coup in 2014, the two nations have seen increased cooperation on military and security issues thanks to the after effects of the Arab Spring, increased Islamization of the Sinai Peninsula, and the burgeoning threat of a Hegemonic Iran. While no one would go so far as to say they are allies, I think it fair to say there is an understanding between the two that their respective geopolitical fears and goals align for the time being.  
  
Crucially, Israel has mastered the art of desert Hydroponics and water politics. They have managed to turn their country into a veritable oasis in the Middle East even as Climate Change continues to hamper and decimate the region. **If Israel were to share some of their technologies and procedures with Egypt, it would go a long way to easing the water strain on Egypt's almost 100 million citizens.** This would have the added benefit of mitigating the crisis between Egypt and Ethiopia (no one wants a military conflict between two massive and relatively unstable countries), and would earn Israel some much needed good will in the region, especially in light of the recent declaration on Jerusalem.

I will have to abandon you and my dear colleagues to go to bed in 10mins. But this is truly fantastic discussion and I hope I could stay longer. If there were any question directed to me later on, I will read them tomorrow morning after I wake up and share my opinion then. Enjoy your discussion!

**Edit 2:17pm ET** Dear Redditors, this is Debbie, Joule and David in Paris. It's 8pm Paris time and our stomachs are rumbling. Going to get a bite to eat. Keep asking your excellent question and we'll be back in an hour to answer them and wrap up.

**Edit 4:54pm ET** Joule, David, and Debbie are back. We'll take any remaining questions for a 1/2 hour or so. AUA!

Thanks for all your excellent questions. You really made us think! So great to join Reddit for COP21 debrief on geopolitics, technology innovation & more. Looking forward to our next AUA in the future!! Debbie, Joule, David & Tao",geopolitics,climate change
38,What can the waning of the Pax Britannica teach us about the waning of the Pax Americana?,71.0,5xm04l,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5xm04l/what_can_the_waning_of_the_pax_britannica_teach/,46.0,1488704198.0,"The 19th Century is typically known as the *Pax Britannica* even though by the later decades of the century, Britain was no longer the dominant great power.  The waning decades of Britain's primacy are highlighted by the rise of Germany, the final decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the Scramble of Africa among other things.  Obviously this makes comparisons to the modern day tricky at best, given the difference of our pressing issues (e.g. climate change, a rising China, a reactionary Russia, and a teetering EU, etc.).  

However, I want to know if we can take a broader view of the decline of British supremacy and prescribe some warnings for the United States as it seems to be on that trajectory in the next several decades.  

One of the major features of the waning era of British dominance was the increasingly dysfunctional international order.  The Congress of Vienna established post-Waterloo was disturbed greatly by Italian and German unification in 1870-71, and although Bismark was well-respected for his diplomatic prowess, he only lasted so long.  It could be argued that the instability brought on by that disturbance was simply too complex for Britain to incorporate into its geopolitical calculus.  

In the context of the United States, there seems to be a potential foil to German unification in the unlikely (if uncomfortable) possibility of the dissolution of the European Union.  The EU can weather Brexit, thankfully to a tenuous relationship between Britain and the EU from the start, but most would probably agree that Europe cannot weather a Frexit, and given how Marine Le Pen is being treated my her opposition, it's highly likely that her chances of final victory are rising.  

I guess the crux of my question is, how can the United States adapt its calculus should Le Pen win, and by extension, France exit the EU?  (Obviously neither scenario is likely, much less both, but for the sake of discussion, I say we assume they are likely.)

The element of chaos introduced in such a massive change seems to be insurmountable to me, and given how easily the powers slipped into war in 1914, I can't help but think that there is at least some important lesson for the United States to learn from Britain's perspective.

Maybe this came off a bit incoherently, but it is 3:51 as I'm typing this out, so maybe that's it.  Anyways, I'm curious to hear what y'all have to say.

Edit:  Don't just limit this to talk about ""grand strategy"" or whatever.  Logistics is probably one of the more underrepresented aspects of all this.  The United States' reliance on satellites, the Internet, and shipping lanes is deeply rooted in Britain's All Red Line and its naval primacy.  So we don't need to be amateurs here, I'd be really interested to hear about the logistical problems and comparisons.",geopolitics,climate change

1. Pushing for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
2. Discouraged Iran in developing nuclear weapons.
3. Vetoed five UN Security Council resolutions in relation to the Syrian conflict including one that will refer the conflict to the International Criminal Court.

#General Introduction

India currently has [a population of 1.28 billion](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html). Its population is expected to increase throughout most of the 21st century, reaching its zenith of 1.75 billion around 2060 before beginning to contract, according to [the UN's medium fertility projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). Based on this projection, India will surpass China as the world's most populous country before 2030. As a developing country with a [population pyramid that's currently bottom-heavy](https://www.populationpyramid.net/india/2015/), India is projected to see a larger and larger proportion of its population reach older ages as the country develops throughout the century. The effect is a population pyramid that is expected to [flatten and lengthen proportionally](https://www.populationpyramid.net/india/2100/)--the country will enjoy a demographic windfall in the early part of the century and will likely see only mild problems related to population aging. According to a [2000 map](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/gpw-v3/gpw-v3-population-density/inddens.jpg), most of India's population centers (areas with more than a thousand inhabitants per square kilometer) are situated in the [humid subtropical areas of its north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_India#/media/File:India_climatic_zone_map_en.svg), near the borders of Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as on its tropical wet southwestern and western coasts.

&nbsp;

During the summer of 2018, NITI Aayog --an Indian government think tank-- reported that the country is ""[currently suffering from the worst water crisis in its history](http://niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/new_initiatives/presentation-on-CWMI.pdf)"" (non-HTTPS PDF). 600 million people across the country are facing ""high to extreme"" water stress due to their lack of access to clean water. This has resulted in around 200,000 deaths per year from polluted water. The report said that 70 percent of India's water is contaminated and highlighted the severely underdeveloped state of India's water infrastructure. The overall situation is not likely to improve in the future, as increasing development and a growing population will lead to an increase in water demand, which the report predicted to be double the available supply by 2030. The report also noted that water shortage will lead to significant food security risks for the country.

[*Full NITI Aayog water management report*](http://pibphoto.nic.in/documents/rlink/2018/jun/p201861401.pdf) *(non-HTTPS PDF via third party--proceed with caution.)*

&nbsp;

Most of India is [agricultural land (60.5%) that is arable (52.8%)](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html). By land area, this makes it ""[the second largest in the world, after the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_India#Output)"", despite only having [roughly a third of the United State's land area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area). However, there is evidence that the large amount of land is not being used to its full potential, and that there is room for India to make massive gains in output of all major agricultural products by improving its productivity (tonnes per hectare) so that it is close to those of developed countries. The largest hurdle towards this is the country's underdevelopment--as the [World Bank's 2008 overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_India#Problems) reported, ""Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation."" The lack of cold storage, food packaging, and safe and efficient transport system results in one of the world's highest food spoilage rates, according to the Wikipedia entry. Despite its underperformance, India is still the sixth-largest net exporter of agricultural goods as of 2013 and its agricultural sector accounts for 15% of its total GDP. Due to the ongoing water crisis that's unlikely to be resolved and likely to intensify, it seems likely that agricultural productivity will decrease.

&nbsp;

Depending on whether the European Union is counted as a country, [India ranks third or fourth in terms of GDP (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP\)), sitting comfortably between the United States and Japan with USD 9.5 trillion. Per capita, [India ranks 119-127 with roughly USD 7,100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP\)_per_capita), and is positioned between Uzbekistan and Laos. It should come as no surprise that India has one of the most uneven wealth distributions in the world, and that this is growing--[in 2012, the top 1% had 28.7% of wealth](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=FB790DB0-C175-0E07-787A2B8639253D5A) (PDF), behind only Indonesia and the United States (based on available data). This was a 10 percentage point increase over the 15.7% recorded in 2002. Despite having services account for 61.5% of GDP, ""slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture"". ""The outlook for India's long-term growth is moderately positive due to a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy"" ([World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html)). However, there are considerable headwinds such as the water and potential food security issues raised earlier in this introduction, as well as issues with the country's underdevelopment and overpopulation in general. 

&nbsp;

Bangalore, one center of the country's information technology industry, is considered the most dynamic city in the world --more so than Silicon Valley-- [according to Jones Lang LaSalle](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/indias-rising-sectors/). The country is the world's top exporter of information and communication technology, according to the [Global Innovation Index](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_gii_2017.pdf) (PDF)--its large and educated English-speaking population allowed it to become the top information technology services exporter, as well as a destination for outsourcing and a source of programmers for western nations. Overall, the country is ranked 60 on said index, with a score of 35.5/100. Key weaknesses include education and the business environment, while strengths include the number of science and engineering graduates, elite universities that are globally competetive, high R&D spending by global companies, and a massive domestic market. India's technology profile bears some resemblance to China's.

&nbsp;

*Most of the following section on climate change will be based on* [Climate: Observations, projections and impacts: India](https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2040/12/India.pdf) *(PDF), published by the University of Nottinghham:*

A wide range of temperatures is experienced across India because of its varied geography. Despite that, India is generally considered a hot country, as many regions experience temperatures greater than 35C during summer. With temperatures projected to increase 3C in the south and 4.5C in the north under the A1B emissions scenario (CMIP3), the risk of deadly heatwaves will be significantly higher. This is especially significant in the northern humid subtropical region, which contains many population centers--the combination of humidity and high heat will lead to high [wet bulb temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature#Wet-bulb_temperature_and_health) in the densely populated region (""A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan""). [A global study](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/22/humidity-may-prove-breaking-point-for-some-areas-as-temperatures-rise-says-study/) concluded that India is the most at risk from high wet bulb temperatures, as the northern region most affected is also the most densely populated.

&nbsp;

Rainfall is expected to increase 5-10% across the country, though there are significant uncertainties with this projection. ""Water stress could increase in India with climate change"" was the consensus of various studies, although there are large variations on details such as magnitude. Wheat and rice --the country's two most valuable exports-- are generally projected to see declines along with mustard and soybean, while coconut yields could increase. There exists high uncertainty in projections of extreme climactic events like extreme precipitation, extreme flooding, and tropical cyclones. There is broad consensus that India is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, with the number affected ranging from 7.6 million to 21 million people.

&nbsp;

Many of the challenges India faces could be solved by developing its rural areas. Unfortunately, the large wealth disparity, the intense water crisis, and the apparent lack of will to solve such a pressing and fundamental problem point towards a country that will not be likely to develop quick enough to meet challenges presented by and intensified by climate change. However, with India's technological capacity, it is possible that innovative solutions will appear. It is this writer's opinion that the country will likely see humanitarian crises of historic proportions and might see increasing amounts of widespread civil unrest in rural areas over this century.

&nbsp;

#Questions

* The densely-populated northern part of the country is likely to experience deadly wet bulb temperatures that might make it uninhabitable--when combined with severe water shortage and consequent food security issues, it is likely that India will generate many prospective refugees. Where would they head towards? Keep in mind that Pakistan and India have historically been hostile to each other and that China seems very unlikely to let in large amounts of refugees due to its culture and its own resource issues, while minor neighbours such as Nepal, Bangladesh, and Nepal would likely shut their doors out of fear of getting overwhelmed. 

* India is supposed to be the west's counterweight to China on the Asian continent. However, the largest democracy in the world is deeply entangled with China as it is India's largest trading partner, with the United States trailing behind by ten billion in total trade. Relations are said to be friendly despite frequent border conflicts between the neighbours. With climate change potentially leading to a weaker and divided India, what sort of vulnerabilities will open up, and how might they be used by the east and/or the west? 

* Combining most of what we've covered so far--how will climate change affect the consolidation of the [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership), of which India is a potential member?

#Questions

* Kyrgyzstan, which is a small and impoverished country, has ""eight major hydrological basins that provide water not only for local needs but for a large part of Central Asia"" (10). It also provides water to neighbouring China. In this series, we have seen that current water scarcity in Asia has already generated tension between two of its most populous countries. Kyrgyzstan, like Nepal, is a small and relatively-poor country that is surrounded by water-stressed countries. What will become of Kyrgyzstan?

* In another thread, one Redditor noted that migration from the Middle East to 'refugia' in sparsely-populated Eastern Russia will be possible due to low border controls there. However, this involves passing through Central Asia--more specifically, Kazakhstan (assuming China is impassable). Assuming this situations comes to pass, how will Kazakhstan deal with the refugees?

*I'm not familiar enough with this region to create any more questions--please feel free to ask your own questions in the discussion*

#General Introduction:

I apologize for this relatively quick and dirty introduction--real life threw me a curveball that's taking up most of my time.

Russia currently has a population of [140 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia), the vast majority of which are [concentrated in Western Russia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Population_Density_as_of_2017.png). The country has experienced a [recent surge in its total fertility rate (TFR)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=RU), which is already the highest in Eastern Europe. However, despite the surge, its population will [gradually decline to 124 million by 2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). This is because Russia's current TFR of 1.75 is still well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Russia faces less of an ageing population problem than developed western countries [due to its high mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_crisis_of_Russia#Demographic_aging_of_the_population) among older people.

Russia is the largest country in the world by a wide margin, as it covers 17 million square kilometers compared to Canada's 10 million. With this landmass, Russia has the most natural resources within its borders--[more than 30% of the global supply](https://www.ems.psu.edu/~williams/russia.htm). [Oil, natural gas, and precious metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia) make up the majority of Russia's exports, while it has a sophisticated technology industry and a globally-recognized arms industry which has an export value that is second to the United States.

The country is 77.7% ethnically Russian, with the other 22.3% spread between a wide assortment of ethnicities. The amount of ethnic Russian is [expected to drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_crisis_of_Russia#Threats) to 46.5% in 2050 due to depopulation and high immigration, according to some scholars (Wikipedia source missing).

Being situated at higher latitudes with unparalleled access to the arctic circle, Russia stands to gain significantly from climate change. Unfortunately, its relatively low population plus their concentration onto its western regions makes it hard for Russia to fully exploit its natural wealth. This will be exacerbated by its low birth rate and resultant population decline. The country recognizes this problem and has been actively incentivizing natives and foreigners to take up residence in its east through policies like the [Russian Homestead Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Homestead_Act). Because of its manpower problems and its vast untapped resources, automation might be a gamechanger for Russia.

&nbsp;

**Questions:**

* How will the opening of the Arctic due to climate change affect Russia's trade and military projection capabilities?

* With Russia's notable computer science capabilities and a long history of notable academics, is it likely that Russia can alleviate its manpower problem through automation?

* Russia's main challenge when dealing with climate change can be summed up as 'over-abundant resources meets manpower shortage' while China's can be summed up as 'overpopulation meets resource shortage'. How will the two neighbors interact in times of difficulty?

* Will Russia accept large amounts of immigrants or refugees to populate its eastern regions? With its ethnic-demographic crisis, how can the country alleviate political risks associated with, for example, Islamification?

As some of you might know, I am currently located in Hong Kong. As I type this, the city is being hit by the world's strongest storm of 2018, in which ""[wind speed is predicted to be the strongest since records began in 1946](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2163875/super-typhoon-mangkhut-predicted-be-most-powerful)"". In the past hour, sustained winds of 140 km/h and gusts of 194 km/h have been recorded ([source at 09:45 am GMT+8](https://www.hko.gov.hk/contente.htm)), and stronger winds are expected as the typhoon inches closer to the city. The typhoon was equivalent to a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane, but has slightly weakened.

I have spent most of the week lugging sandbags, securing flying hazards, taping windows (it works), and stocking supplies--though it sounds like I'm organized, observers would say that I was running around like a headless chicken. I *could* sit down for six hours to write the post, but I'll use this typhoon as a convenient and fitting excuse to procrastinate a bit.

This post is a good opportunity to discuss the effects of extreme climactic events brought on by climate change and their effects on geopolitcs. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is accompanied by Hurricane Florence, Tropical Storm Olivia, and many other storms around the world, which has [sparked debate about whether climate change contributed to this swarm of storms or whether it is just a coincidence](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2164111/super-typhoon-mangkhut-and-six-other-storms-threatening-chaos).

India isn't much better. Before you say their per capita emissions are low - this isn't true in practice. A significant portion of the population still live in or close to poverty (in India the vast majority still live in underdeveloped areas, in rural farms and villages); when we only include the proportion of the population who are actually using the energy produced (i.e.: the industrialists/factory owners and wealthy), emissions per person are high and can be expected to increase a worrying amount over the coming years.

Now I understand China and India want to prioritise economic growth over climate considerations, but why? The vast majority of China's population live in low-lying areas, and most of China's industrial complex is on the coast, and is very vulnerable to flooding. Meanwhile for India, some of its largest cities, like Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Visakhapatnam are on the coast and are already seeing the effects of climate change, while much of the north is vulnerable to drought and desertification.

I would understand these countries' attitudes if they weren't very vulnerable to climate change (like Russia), but they are - it seems totally counter to their self interests to care this little. And whether it's ""fair"" or not, the future of the planet largely depends on how Asia tackles energy production now\*.

Why are they not taking the necessary strides to reduce emissions (both countries have the resources and technology to move towards nuclear and hydroelectric) and what can be done to change this?

\*I am not trying to absolve western countries of responsibility here; the US for sure isn't doing nearly enough and its emissions per capita are eye watering, while countries like Germany seem to be going backwards, but for this discussion I would like to talk about the Asian giants",geopolitics,climate change

I'm even more puzzled following Trump's emphasis on the Wall and, before that, the EU's refugee crises.  

I move on to bafflement given what a vested interest any military has in diverse, resilient, and sustainable supply lines, a pacified populace that sustain a long slog, and how much potential cross over there is in a lot of green tech and military applications (portable solar,  distribute and automated food production/water desalination, batteries, etc.)

Skyrocketing temperatures, flooding, loss of arable land, water, etc. and accompanying chaos are likely inevitable and yet it seems to me that very few nations are pre-building capacities to either ward off popular uprisings, prepare for their neighbors collapse and flood of refugees, seize territory en mass? 

What about the ability to potentially weaponize climate change or, conversely, prepare to try and alter the temperature while sustaining global pushback?  

There's quite a bit that's possible, especially for ambitious autocrats, to prepare for that would allow them to exploit the chaos.  

And yes, aside from Russia taking a pretty good look at the north pole, I can't think of anyone pushing this?  

So, why aren't the militaries pushing this?  

If so, how?

#General Introductions

The region under discussion is comprised of the following six countries (sorted by population; descending):

* Ukraine

* Belarus

* Moldova

* Lithuania

* Latvia

* Estonia

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* All populations in the region are projected to be below (or well below) 1950 levels by 2100. The region is likely to experience some issues with population aging, but the projections suggest that these issues will be mild--especially when compared with other regions such as southern Europe.

* Moldova is exceptionally poor ($6,700 GDP PPP per capita) and its economy has a relatively heavy reliance on agriculture (17.7%). Its annual renewable freshwater per capita is the lowest out of all countries in the region, at 456 m3. Ukraine is not far ahead, at $8,800 GDP PPP per capita (which makes suspect the claim that only 3.8% of its population is below the poverty line), 12.2% of GDP from agriculture, and the second lowest per annual renewable freshwater (1,217 m3). It claims to be ""the country with the least water resources among the countries of Europe"". These factors make these countries the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

* The region has high per capita food production, with the vast majority of the population living in countries producing 12,000 - 25,000 kcal/cap/day (2010 data). All else equal, food security should not be an issue going forward.

* The region has large amounts of arable land--Ukraine, which accounts for much more than half the land of the region, is 56% arable, while other countries have relatively large amounts (Moldova 55%, Lithuania 35%, Belarus 27%). Though some countries, like Ukraine, have noted that climate change can bring yield increases, significant decreases in yields have been projected using more comprehensive outlooks. It should be noted that decreases in yields only apply to existing crops, and that there are crops that might better flourish in the new conditions, and that several countries have acknowledged this in their UNFCCC communications.

* Water resources and water security were not as well-covered in the UNFCCC communications as in other regions--this might be because, aside from Ukraine and Moldova, there is little cause for concern about water resources. This is especially true for the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).

#Observations

* Projected population growth is much less dramatic than in all other parts of Africa, where many countries are expected to see fourfold increases over the century. With the exception of Mauritania, countries in the region are expected to see two-fold or lower population increases.

* However, the general dryness of the region due to its latitude and the presence of the Sahara means that water scarcity will almost certainly be a major issue in the near future, if it isn't already. Annual per capita renewable internal freshwater resources for Egypt, the most populous country in the region, is a mere 20 m3, while Morocco, which has the highest value for this statistic, stands only at 845 m3.

* Because of its dry climate and geography, the region's agriculture has a higher focus on livestock, as reflected by the large proportion of agricultural land that is permanent pasture. As livestock consume much more water per Calorie of food output, water stress should have a major impact on agriculture in the region, along with food security. Nomadic herders should become more common, and should leave behind large swathes of overgrazed land that are even more prone to desertification. Overgrazing and desrtification are already major environmental issues in the region, and this looks likely to enter a feedback loop.

* The region is notable for the high homogeneity of its ethic makeups, with Egypt being 99.7% Egyptian, Algeria and Morocco being 99% Arab-Berber,and Tunisia being 98% Arab. The same can be said of religions in the region--basically all Sunni Muslims.

* The region is relatively wealthy compared to other African regions, with the notable exception of the contested Western Sahara. The wealth might help mitigate some of the impacts of climate change, but the raw vulnerability of the region--water stress in particular--makes its prospects the same, if not worse, than destitute-but-water-rich regions to the south.

50,EU Migration Crisis General Discussion,53.0,91p63g,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91p63g/eu_migration_crisis_general_discussion/,97.0,1532497842.0,"#[CNBC: Europe’s migration crisis is ‘make-or-break’ for the EU, Germany’s Merkel says](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/europes-migration-crisis-is-make-or-break-for-the-eugermanys-mer.html)

Before I continue with this submission statement, I'd like to preface it by saying that I am not posting this because I would like to see the EU fail, as a poster in my [now-deleted thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91k18w/the_eu_melting_pot_is_melting_down_niall_ferguson/) has outright said --I truly admire some ideals of the EU and would love to see it succeed-- but because I believe level-headed discussion of the topic based on reality, uncontaminated by hopes, desires, and ideals, is key to finding a solution, and this is especially true in a democratic bloc like the EU.

The effect of the migrant crisis on the EU is one of the biggest, if not *the* biggest, geopolitical topics of our generation. The issue is quintessentially geopolitical, as it strongly concerns geography (Europe's proximity to migrant sources, the proximity of EU member countries to migrant sources, the nature of the southern border), as well as the political interaction between EU member states, between the EU and migrant-generating countries, and more. Furthermore, the potential outcomes of this issue have far-reaching and long-lasting implications for both the global community and the ideological zeitgeist of the west. This is why it is important to have a thorough debate on the issue, and what better place to do it than on a well-moderated academic sub?

This was my train of thought in when starting my previous post on the topic earlier today, when I regrettably used an article written by Niall Ferguson as a conversation-starter for the controversial topic. This was a mistake, as I soon found out that people are rightly skeptical of facts and arguments put forward by Ferguson, regardless of their merit. No productive discussion around a subject can take place if the conversation starter is tainted by such a high degree of questionability, which defeats the purpose of the post. This is why I deleted the post. I apologize for not thoroughly checking the credibility of the source (I was not aware of Ferguson's media profile).

CNBC ran the linked story roughly ten days after Ferguson published his article. In the CNBC article, Merkel explicitly acknowledges that the migration crisis is the single most critical threat to the entire EU Project. The article highlights the delicate political balancing not only within EU member states, like what Merkel faces, but also between EU member states, which was further highlighted in this [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44632471) published the next day. 

&nbsp;

Questions I would like to pose about the crisis include:

* Will the number of refugees increase as climate change intensifies and automation reduces available opportunities?

* Assuming the above is true, will the amount of refugees seeking to enter the EU increase beyond what is practical to defend borders against? (Remember: we are potentially dealing with tens of millions of desperate human beings fleeing for their lives over years, if not decades)

* Are the solutions reached during the summit at the end of last month sufficient?

* What are some long-term humane and diplomatic solutions to the crisis? Keep in mind that governments of refugee-producing countries are likely corrupt and lack the capability to effectively/humanely administer solutions, and that this will get worse with climate change and increased automation.",geopolitics,climate change

#Observations

*Questions have been replaced by observations, which presents patterns, trends, and other observations that stood out when compiling information for the general introduction. This is more constructive than having me flaunt my ignorance while trying to come up with engaging questions for regions I know little about.*

* Central African nations are generally rich in freshwater, with all except for Chad exceeding 10,000 m3 per capita of renewable internal freshwater resources--Equatorial Guinea exceeds 20,000 m3, the Central African Republic exceeds 30,000 m3, the Republic of the Congo exceeds 40,000 m3, and Gabon has close to 90,000 m3. Despite the fact that populations are projected to boom in these countries--with fourfold increases in population by 2100 being the norm--many of them are not under a geographical threat of water stress, though there are issues with water infrastructure in many of these underdeveloped countries and a high dependence on rainfall for agriculture. Some have noted in their communications to the UNFCCC that they consider water to be their most valuable resource. It is highly likely that these water-rich nations will be at the center of water struggles in the future.

* Countries of the region are projected to see a massive boom in population over the next century, with a fourfold increase being the norm. At the same time, these countries are also projected to move up the development ladder in demographic terms, as reflected by their projected population pyramids.

* Poverty rates in the region are high, with all countries with available data showing poverty rates at or above 30%, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo--the most populous-- reaching 63%, while three other countries are at around 45%.

* Agriculture plays a large role in the region, though not as large as in Eastern Africa. Coffee is a major cash crop in the region, and is especially vulnerable to changes to its growing environment--especially temperature--if I remember correctly. Chad is the most vulnerable to strife and humanitarian crises: it derives 59% of its GDP from agriculture, and its agricultural practices accelerate desertification, its farmers are dependent on rainfall (precipitation is expected to become less stable), and water resources are very vulnerable to climate change while it has very little renewable freshwater (lowest in the region by a wide margin).

* Parts of Central Africa, which is hot and humid, may be hit by wet bulb temperatures that are deadly for humans. With agriculture playing large roles in these countries, this could be especially costly.


&nbsp;

The region scheduled for next week contains fifteen countries, which is the largest amount so far. Combined with the fact that roughly half of the UNFCCC reports for these countries are in French, which significantly increases my workload, there is a chance that the post will be delayed.

#General Introductions

With this post we have finally left the old world and entered the new world, six months after the series began. 

South America has been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook, from which a large portion of the information found in the spreadsheet was taken from. The region under discussion is comprised of the following five countries (listed by population; descending):

* Argentina

* Chile

* Bolivia

* Paraguay

* Uruguay

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* Argentina, the most populous country in the region, is projected to see its population grow roughly 30% this century, while Bolivia, the third most populous, is projected to see roughly 50% growth. Chile and Paraguay are projected to see much more modest growths, and Uruguay will be in the midst of a steep decline by the end of the century.

* Population pyramids of the region suggest they are in the mid-range of development, as many of them have relatively slight bulges around their bottom and lower-mid age brackets. Bolivia's bottom-heavy profile reflects its relatively low level of development, while Uruguay's comparatively flat profile suggests a higher level of development.

* Though there are inconsistencies with poverty line estimates used by the source, there seems to be a high level of impoverishment in the region, with Bolivia having particularly high rates of impoverishment. The region's average GDP PPP per capita is $17,700, with Bolivia ($7,600) and Chile ($24,600) being range-defining outliers. This puts the region at the same level of wealth as southeastern Europe.

* Despite Chile having a high coastline-to-area ratio compared to non-island countries, sea level rise and its impacts do not seem to be of particular concern to its government. On the other hand, Argentina's main concern with sea level rise seems to be tourism (beaches, cliffs, and real estate), which is one of the main economic activities of the coastal region.

* Agriculture plays a relatively large role in the region's economies. Agricultural land is plentiful, though the vast majority is permanent pasture. Per capita food production in the region is adequate, with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay each producing 12,000 - 25,000 Calories per capita per day, while Chile and Bolivia each produce 3,000 - 7,000 Calories. Most countries have indicated that their agriculture sectors are among the most vulnerable to climate change, and project that many crops will see significant declines in yields. Argentina has projected that yields of soybeans and corn will increase ""considerably and moderately, respectively"", though its findings are not echoed by other countries.

* The region has an abundance of freshwater, with per capita renewable internal freshwater resources averaging at 26,000 m3. Argentina (6,800 m3) and Chile (50,000 m3) are the range-defining outliers. Despite this, the relatively low level of development means that there are many locales without adequate water infrastructure, and this is reflected by the apparently low amount of irrigated farmland in the region. The information contained within the UNFCCC communications and other sources do not provide enough information for me to write an observation on the impacts of climate change on the region.

53,[Discussion] The current crisis in the West and what is to come,50.0,ag4evf,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ag4evf/discussion_the_current_crisis_in_the_west_and/,60.0,1547524596.0,"Hello, in this thread I would like to have an in-depth discussion on the currently ongoing rise of populism (both ""nationalist"" and ""socialist"") and seemingly happening collapse of the prevailing ""liberal establishment"" across the West. From what I have seen I can say that the rise of these populists happened generally because of a combination of stagnant/declining economic conditions and the mass migrations that happened since the end of the cold war.

However the reason for it seems to vary to some extent between places and depending on the conditions either populist-nationalists (Trump, Salvini, Le Pen) or populist-socialists (Corbyn) have risen from outside of the liberal establishment.


- In the United States decades of stagnant living standards that even declined after 2008 alongside the massive waves of migration that changed the country's demographics ultimately now resulting in the forecast of whites becoming a minority led to the election of Donald Trump. The manufacturing decline in massive amount after the end of the cold war that happened because of economic globalization and it's results being disproportionally going to higher classes and leaving behind the poor (especially white) as well as mass waves of migration that changed the country and the general indifference of the ""elite"" and to a large extent the hostility of the ""new"" progressive left of intersectionality that alienated the majority population and created alarms of their country being taken away from them created the stage for the rise of populists from outside of the establishment, manifested in the current president and the populist-socialist Bernie Sanders.

- Also in the UK the situation seems to be similar, large swaths of the population being in stagnant/declining condition while mass migration brought in visible changes and also problems like terrorism and other crimes. The vote for brexit seems to also be fuelled by a desire to take back ""sovereignty"" from the European Union in an attempt to maximize control over national policies and also rein down on migration.

- In Italy last year the rise of the 5Star and the League seems also to be due to a good combination of the aforementioned two primary reasons, an abysmal economy alongside a migrant crisis that led to a surge of populists and the liberal establishment going out of power last year.

- In Spain the vox party recently had a breakthrough in Andalusia, even with similar economic conditions to that of Italy Spain didn't have populist-nationalists rise to power there but only after the recent surge in migrant arrivals vox had it's rise.

- To the north, the rise of the afd in Germany seems to primarily be due to the migrant crisis that brought in huge waves into Germany and the problems associated with them.

- Further north in Sweden, the breakthrough of the Sweden Democrats can also be primarily attributed to the massive influx of migrants in recent times and the failure/inability to integrate them alongside the waves of visible crimes.

- In France the recent ""yellow vest"" protests can be more attributed to economic matters but perhaps not fully detached from the migration related identity ones, considering a sizeable portion of the protestors have been nationalists according to surveys.

- To the east in the former Eastern Bloc countries (especially visible in Poland and Hungary) the rise of nationalists seems to be more of a resurgence of nationalist sentiments that were suppressed during the cold war, clever politicians to a large extent however have evidently used migration and other problems in the West as a boost to their platform.

So from above we can say the reason for the seemingly happening retreat of the liberal establishment varies, in the US/UK/Italy it was both the bad economics and mass migration while in Germany/Scandinavia it is primarily the mass migration and less the economics that gave populist-nationalists the breakthrough. A general disgruntlement seemingly has set over the working classes and probably making it's way up to the middle class as well, fuelled by generally bad economic conditions/visible and increasing inequality that for large swaths of the population has created a pessimistic outlook for the future. The matter of identity that has been brought into question by the post cold war mass migrations and alarm of the majority becoming a minority that has been fuelled to a large extent also by the visible problems brought on by said migrants such as moderate to very-high levels of crime rate compared to the natives and terror attacks (this seen among the Islamic migrants almost exclusively) and also the recent arrivals being generally an economic drain to a large extent by them having not been integrated and being on welfare. All of this has also seen the trust in institutions (Banks, media, government etc) plummet.

Then the perceived and occasionally real indifference of the liberal elite to these matters and the alienating tone of the intersectionalist left (such as preaching ""tolerance"", ""diversity"", ""multiculturalism"". Occasionally in a harsh and hostile tone towards the native working/middle classes.) created space for the emergence of populist-nationalists (Trump/Salvini/Le Pen) and populist-socialists (Sanders/Corbyn), the letter of which can be called the reemergence of the ""old"" left of economics of ""class struggle"" rather than ""identity politics"".

Adding to all this is also the dwindling fertility rates in the first world in general that creates the space for importing migrant workers but ultimately fails to address the main problem and prevent the population decline, in a way only kicking the can down the road.

We also have warming of the globe that is changing the climate, and while this is generally a detrimental matter to the planet many countries to the north also stand to benefit from it by having sea lanes opened up for navigation and commerce/land opened up and that creating the conditions for extraction of resources as well as for colonization and agriculture while taking minimal damage compared to countries further south. Russia is perhaps the main example of this. But there are also problems coming due to this, especially the ""climate migration"", potentially hundreds of millions of migrants trying to make their way from Africa (which has a very high fertility rate and is projected to have over twice it's current population by the middle of this century) and also from the middle East and maybe even south Asia (all of which are projected to be hit badly by the changing climate) towards better areas further north can also be seen as an impending existential crisis for Europe/Russia/North America, the last of which less certain due to the geographic circumstances (the southern border being more defensible) as well as Latin America having and being projected to have less population compared to the previously mentioned regions. These matters however barely get discussed in the public and is unclear how much in the inside by the current governing establishment.

Now before summing this all up into the main questions of the discussion I would like to make some points:

- Demographic trends are not absolute but can be broken with sufficient circumstances, Israel can be pointed at to some extent as the example of a developed country with high living standards that also has a high fertility rate, however this is propped up by the ultraorthodox population with a strict religious way of life. Mass social/cultural changes like retreat from secularism and general reversal of many feminist achievements as well as probably spreading and creating fear of ethnic/racial ""suicide"" can potentially have great success (these needless to say however are not compatible with liberal ideologies the way they are today). The matter of fertility rates can also not be compared to much of any previous historical occasions which creates a lack of empirical comparison.

- The way I see it, the reason for the greater successes of the populist-nationalists instead of the populist-socialists is because of the matter of identity that is under question because of recent mass migration and the progressives being unable to/not wanting to address this due to it being against their core ideology (something that can be seen in the preachings of tolerance/diversity/multiculturalism, that has it's basis in full human equality) while large and larger parts of the population (especially in Western Europe) do not even see those migrants as a part of their nation. The populist-nationalists addressing these matters and appealing to said parts of the population is what gives them the edge over their socialist opponents who are only limited to addressing the economic problems.

- Going by the aforementioned point, the increasing share of the said migrant/minority populations in the West seems to be creating a hotbed for ethnic/racial conflict. Much of said minorites that have come tend to not mix much with the natives and fail to adapt to the culture and integrate while their sheer number helps create ghettoized ""parallel societies"", the failure to integrate and assimilate can be blamed on massive cultural differences/lack of much willingness on both sides as well as in many cases the minorities being ""unassimilable"" (for large parts of the population) due to them being of a different racial group and thus looking very visibly different. This both creates a mutual hostility between the majority and the minorites, something that given the currently worsening situation might lead to outright ethic conflicts,a thing that perhaps is more observable in Europe than in North America.

- The general decline of the West in relative military and economic power against other parts of the world (most evidently China) also creates a kind of ""dread"" in parts of the population, some of which seem to be in key positions in the populist-nationalist movements that seem to have designs about a ""clash of civilizations"" scenario. Many of the current populist-nationalists across the EU seem to not have any intention to exit the union or dissolve it but rather transform it and make it into an European Union defined and United across racial-cultural lines rather than the current liberal Democratic one which is more ""idealistic"", while the one people like Viktor Orban would prefer being more ""blood and soil"". Something like this can also potentially bring Russia into the fold. Many populist-nationalists like Trump/Salvini/Orban etc seem to have a good relationship with Moscow, one of Donald Trump's foreign policy goal seems to be rapprochement with Russia which is very important for the US to contain/sufficiently counter China in Eurasia.

- The current liberal establishment also evidently lacks strategic vision and due to the populist rise also in public space has lost the hegemony over ""ideas"" and the ability to set the agendas which makes it even harder to govern the countries well. They also to a large extent are responsible for much of the problems themselves.


Now from these above points we can come to the conclusion that:

- The West is under an ""identity crisis"", where the gap between the liberal ideals of the elite and upper classes and the blood and soil one of the lower classes are widening.

- The stagnant/declining economic conditions have created the room for further rage.

- Unintegrated and unassimilated minorities from different cultural and racial groups have created/are creating fault lines in the societies.

- The above point is now fuelling the rise of the populist-nationalists and has been brought to the forefront as the primary issue after the 2015 migrant crisis which very visibly acted as a galvanizing shock across Western societies.

- The West in general is currently under a relative decline and the current dominant power the United States is going to have to look for ways to counter China, something that Russia is very instrumentally useful in regard to. The likes of Henry Kissinger have lobbied for it, and it seems to be a goal Donald Trump himself has to a large extent.


Now the main questions that I have and would like to have a discussion on are:

1. How much according to you people are these assessments above are correct?

2. The next decade is evidently going to be very interesting and will likely see the establishments continue it's decline and might even completely collapse, who do you think has the greater chance of a total takeover between the nationalists and socialists?

3. If the radical nationalists takeover by winning against the liberal establishment and the socialists what you think they are going to do?

4. Same as #3 but the socialists instead of nationalists.

5. Do you think in case the nationalists or rather the ""racial-culturalist"" as we can call some of them takeover, Russia can/will be brought into the EU or some wider alliance?

6. Do you think the widening divide in the US and it having a larger share of visible minorities compared to other Western countries can lead to ethnic/racial alongside ideological problems strong enough that can fracture the country in the near future?

7. Climate change is something that is projected to hit the global South, the countries in Africa/middle east/South Asia/Latin America the hardest while for many of the northern countries the damages will be minimal in comparison, and since it looks very unlikely that the warming of the globe is going to be halted (let alone reversed) barring revolutionary scientific breakthroughs do you think many countries in the North especially the potential wider EU that includes Russia will use it to reverse geopolitical decline (a matter that is made more complex by the fact that in such a case southern Europe will take a disproportionate amount of damage compared to the north)?

8. Depending on what kind of people are in charge, what you think the responses to the potential climate migration crisis will be and how will the societies under threat from it survive?

9. Many economists are currently foreseeing a downtown by the end of the decade, do you think this will significantly accelerate the fall of the liberal establishment? What do you foresee if the next recession hits nastily hard like the 2008 one?


I know many topics and matters in this thread are sensitive and controversial across the West, but I deem this place one for free/serious/in-depth discussion (especially compared to more mainstream subs) on geopolitics which is a rare thing in my experience on the internet and by that it would be great to have a discussion on these matters and have my mistakes pointed out while others might also learn something.

#Observations

* The region is projected to see population growth over the century, in sharp contrast with most of Europe. Both Sweden and Norway are projected to see roughly 30% increases over the remainder of the century, with other countries seeing more modest growth. Unlike other countries in the region, Sweden and Norway do not appear to be reaching a peak or plateau in their populations by the end of the century. Population pyramids of the region are relatively flat and do not suggest that problems related to population aging will be an issue in any of the countries.

* Most of the region's inhabitants reside in the southern areas of their respective countries due to present and historical climate conditions.

* The region is very wealthy, with average and median GDP PPP per capita above $50,000. GDP compositions suggest that the region is also highly developed, with services dominating and agriculture having a very minor role. Even if climate change were to have significant negative impacts on the region, its constituent countries' high wealth and development indicate high adaptivity and purchasing power, which are instrumental in mitigating negative effects.

* Sea level rise will be mostly a non-issue in most parts of the region due to [land uplift](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/research/interesting-topics/land-uplift) (also known as '[post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound))' cancelling out the effects of sea level rise. Iceland's case is special due to its proximity to Greenland, according to its UNFCCC report: ""[...] the melting of the Greenland ice sheet will affect the gravitational field around Greenland in a way that, with other things being equal, would lower sea level in the vicinity of Greenland"".

* An increase in the lengths of growing seasons due to increases in temperatures, as well as higher carbon dioxide levels, will have positive effects on the yields of many existing crops, though some will be negatively affected. Agricultural land is expected to increase. A common major concern is the increase of new pests and diseases, as well as increased transevaporation leading to increase risk of drought. The region has middling per capita food production as a whole, but Denmark is one of the two most productive countries in the world. The region currently experiences extremely low amounts of malnutrition and is almost certainly going to continue to do so, barring major unforseen events.

* The region stands head and shoulders (knees and toes, too) above Europe and the rest of the world in terms of renewable freshwater resources per capita--Iceland has the world's highest amount, at 519,000 m3, while Norway has 74,000 m3, Finland has 20,000 m3, Sweden has 18,000 m3, and Denmark has 1,063 m3, with the region averaging at 126,000 m3. For comparison, the global average is 5,900 m3; the average of OECD members is 8,200 m3, and the average of the European Union is 3,000 m3. It's very interesting to note that freshwater resources (per inhabitant) of Europe are largely concentrated in non-EU members--best illustrated by [this chart](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20171005-1?inheritRedirect=true). This is not to say that countries in the region will not experience issues with water quality and availability, as distribution of water depends on available infrastructure, which certain areas may lack; flooding and a rise in temperature can lead to deterioration of water quality; changes to precipitation patterns (projected to substantially increase in the region) can lead to droughts and floods, among other potential issues.

56,Thoughts on the prospects of the Muslim brotherhood coming to power in Egypt and it's geopolitical effects,46.0,gpsw1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gpsw1j/thoughts_on_the_prospects_of_the_muslim/,15.0,1590338738.0,"The Arab spring brought down Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and the subsequent elections led to the rise to power of the Muslim brotherhood. That of course did not last long as the secularist army backed by the secular economic elite and the gulf monarchies deposed the islamist government and put in place general El-Sisi.

But even if the Ikhwan was couped out of power, it would be a mistake to think that it is gone. The 2011 election demonstrated that a strong majority of the public is conservative islamist and wants a government that reflects that. A demographic loop where lower class conservative people with high birthrate create lots of children who in turn neither climb up the social ladder nor secularize their worldview and retain the high birthrate leads to a continued demographic shift in favor of the islamist political forces. As such the Ikhwan is strongly supported by the lower classes while mainly upper class wealthy secularists and the army backed by [gulf monarchies](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/world/middleeast/recordings-suggest-emirates-and-egyptian-military-pushed-ousting-of-morsi.html) are the forces that oppose their rise to power.

For those who know of it, the Ikhwan is similar to the Indian RSS. It is a political-religious graasroots level mass movement that has existed for a long time and survived government crackdowns.

Now coming to the chances of their return to power, it can be safely considered to be inevitable sooner or later with the current trends. The current government under president Sisi is a fragile regime with not much popularity, in addition Egypt is not an especially food secure country. The effects of food shortages leading to protests leading to toppling of regimes or descent into civil war that happened a decade ago and was termed the ""Arab spring"" is well documented and climate change induced drowth make a repeat of that very likely. The Coronavirus induced economic downturn, whether ""only"" a steep recession or a full fledged depression is going to have a globally destabilizing effect and Egypt is no exception. Food is already being [stockpiled](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/egypt-coaxes-wheat-local-farmers-000000477.html) by the state. Indeed it is likely that in this decade a similar turmoil like in 2011 can ultimately bring down the current regime and lead to the return of Ikhwan. The [divisions that popped up](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/organizational-split-and-radicalization-within-egypts-muslim-brotherhood) after the 2013 deposition should be expected to give way when opportunity presents itself again as the fundamental goals are the same.

It is certain that learning from the experience of last time the Ikhwan regime this time will unleash a purge of the military quickly after coming to power in order to preempt any coup attempt. A more radical government is to be expected this time not a more moderate one. The army however is still a powerful force and there exists foreign backers for an anti-islamist coup in the form of the gulf monarchies, the US and Israel. Though there is also going to be committed allies for the ikhwan in the form of Qatar, Turkey and also Iran (Assuming the current islamist leaderships are still around).

Islamists dominate demographically but the upper class with the economic power remains secular. The army itself also has important economic assets and a vested interest in not losing power. It is going to be particularly important as to how the Ikhwan deals with the army, whether only a purge followed by the absorption of the remaining officer corps of the army as an integral and loyal part of the new regime or a full fledged attempt at breaking the power of the army by establishing an IRGC style separate military force loyal to the islamist regime. The strength of the secular democratic regime as well as the presence of strong and organized non-islamist political forces in Turkey prevented Erdogan from enacting a full fledged Islamist state while in Iran the Shah's regime that had kept the opposition weak and levers of power centralized immediately gave way to the Shiite revolutionary Islamic republic. Egypt is more similar to Iran than to Turkey and so the rise of a Iranian style Islamic republic under Ikhwan is likely. Depending on how the regime falls chaos can get unleashed and spiral into a civil war but that is a worst case scenario and an islamist government emerging and subduing the army is more likely.

Needless to say the emergence of an islamist Egypt will have immense effects in the region. Relations with Israel, the gulf monarchies and the West would rupture while islamists around the region will have a powerful new patron. One consequence would be that the chances of getting gulf and Western backing in the dam dispute against Ethiopia would be immediately dead in the water. If field Marshal Haftar by this hypothetical time is still fighting in Libya he would be besieged and face trouble from the East. Relations with Israel would immediately become confrontational. This may even make Saudi Arabia feel too besieged in the region that it will lash out. Tensions will certainly rise in the region.

Lastly an important point I would make is that Egypt can turn out to be a more influential power in terms of appealing to other middle Eastern Arab countries than Turkey and Iran. Egypt is Arab, it was once the bastion of pan-Arab nationalism. Neither Turkey that arouses memories of Ottoman oppression nor Iranic and Shia Iran can match the ethnonationalistic appeal of Egypt. One of the main thing responsible for the failures of pan-Arab nationalism was it being staunchly secular with a disproportionate amount of Christian presence that did much to alienate conservative islamists. An islamist Egypt however when it tries to appeal to other Arab countries in nationalistic terms will not have this weakness and thus a combination of pan-arab nationalism and islamism can be expected to arise and be used by the Ikhwan regime. I believe it is very likely to happen since it's a low hanging fruit.",geopolitics,climate change

#General Introductions

We were supposed to begin covering Africa this week, but I realized that I forgot to include the three countries in the Caucasus region. This post completes our coverage of the Asian contient.

As the region is composed of three countries, essay-like introductions are impractical. Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries are listed in order of their population sizes.

#Questions

*I'm entirely unfamiliar with the region, so I only have one question*

* The region seems to be fractured, with two out of three countries having independent states on their territories. These countries are geopolitically weak relative to their neighbours: Turkey, Iran, and Russia. NATO and the west are looking to extend their reach to the region, while Russia is looking to draw it into its sphere of influence. With the realities of climate change in mind, which way is the region likely to fall? According to [this Stratfor article](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/caucasus-laboratory-geopolitics), which you might find helpful, as I did, Georgia is pro-west (though shifting and reportedly at risk of being Finlandized by Russia), Azerbaijan is neutral (playing off both), while Armenia is pro-Russia.

Over the past few years, China has been pouring money into solar power R&D.  On the surface level, this is a reaction to their own pollution problems, and as a response to climate change.  But it seems possible that it is also part of a greater goal of eliminating foreign energy dependence, and undercutting Russia and USA's ability to profit from energy exports, as China exports solar products.  It would still be a long way off, but if solar continues making such great strides, and battery tech catches up, it doesn't seem like an implausible scenario within a decade or three.

I don't consider myself extremely well versed in geopolitics, so what I'm asking is if there are some greater factors at play that might make this an invalid motivation (or maybe it's a newb question and strikingly obvious to most here?).

#General Introductions

Due to the tiny populations of many island nations (e.g. Tonga, with 104,000; or Tuvalu, with 10,000 people) and their inconsequential GDPs, countries in the subregions will be grouped into one introduction.

&nbsp;

**Australia**

With [a population of 25 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Australia) spread over 7.7 million square kilometers of land, Australia is one of the most sparsley populated countries on the planet, [with 3.1 inhabitants per square kilometer](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3218.0Main%20Features752016?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=3218.0&issue=2016&num=&view=)--it is a country the size of the United States, but with fourteen times fewer inhabitants. This is due to a [climate that is largely inhospitable to human settlement](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification_maps_of_Australia#/media/File:Australia-climate-map_MJC01_1.svg), as a large swathe of the inner landmass is a desert surrounded by a thick ring of treeless grasslands. As the climate suggests, [the country as a whole does not receive much rain](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Rainfall-distribution-in-Australia-Australian-Government-Bureau-of-Meteorology-Climate_fig1_250119451) and is [already the subject of frequent and severe droughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought_in_Australia). It comes as no surprise that almost [all important settlements are concentrated on the temperate southeastern coast](https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2017/07/Population-density-australia-June-2016.jpg), with smaller settlements on the subtropical eastern and southwestern coast. Despite having a tropical climate, the northern coast is basically undeveloped. Much of this can be attributed to [the very young age of the large country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia), which was first settled in 1788 and federated into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.

As is to be expected of a young, growing, and sparsley populated country, Australia's population is [projected to continue its steady, linear rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)) from its current population of 23 million, to 33 million in 2050, to 42 million by 2100. The vast majority of this growth will be driven by immigration, as [the country's fertility rate in 2016 was 1.79](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3301.0Main%20Features42016?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=3301.0&issue=2016&num=&view=), which is below the replacement rate. [Most of the immigrants are from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Australia#Country_of_birth_of_Australian_residents) the United Kingdom (1.2 million residents as of 2016), while New Zealand, China, and India are all significant contributors (roughly 500,000 each), with a total of 28.5% of the resident population having been born overseas. With a steady flow of migrants, Australia faces relatively mild population aging, with a population pyramid that's [currently quite balanced](https://www.populationpyramid.net/australia/2015/) predicted to face [substantial flattening and lengthening up until 2100](https://www.populationpyramid.net/australia/2100/).

[Australia has vast amounts of mineral resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia), and has successfully exploited them to become one of the world's largest exporters of minerals. The country is [mostly agricultural land](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html) (53% of land), with the vast majority of it being permanent pasture (47%) and the remaining being arable (6%). Its most valuable agricultural products are [animal products (especially cattle and milk) and wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Australia#Major_agricultural_products). Rearing livestock leaves a substantial water footprint as [it takes many times more water to create a Calorie of animal product than crops and generates significant water pollution](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/5146067), which is significant in a country that is already water-stressed. Despite this, [Australia's large size and small population means it has two arable hectares per person and is a leading food-exporting nation](https://theconversation.com/how-many-people-can-australia-feed-76460) (65% of farm production exported), which means both food security and economic value are not very significant issues even in the face of a burgeoning population and potential water scarcity, as [agriculture only makes up 3.6% of GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html), while industry is 26%, and services covers the remaining 70%. 

Australia is expected to be strongly affected by climate change over this century. [An Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report from 2016](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap25_FINAL.pdf) predicts with high confidence that there will be: ""more frequent hot extremes, less frequent cold extremes""; an increase in fire weather in most of southern Australia; a range of rainfall changes, the dry end of which ""would have severe implications for agriculture, rural livelihoods, ecosystems, and urban water supply, and would increase the need for transformational adaptation""; and an increase in frequency and/or intensity of extreme climactic events in many locations. There was also a vague suggestion that ""some sectors in some locations have the potential to benefit from projected changes in climate and increasing atmospheric CO2"".

&nbsp;

**New Zealand**

New Zealand has a population of 4.5 million and is in many ways similar to Australia, but poorer (apologies to New Zealanders reading this). 

Its population is slated to [continue growing linearly until 2050](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant)), when it will begin to gradually plateau and its population pyramid will see [gradual aging through 2100](https://www.populationpyramid.net/new-zealand/2100/), signified by flattening and lengthening. Unlike Australia, [it is experiencing mass emigration to Australia](https://www.populationpyramid.net/migrants/en/new-zealand/2013/), though immigration from other countries (most notably, the United Kingdom) more than makes up for the emigrants. It has a similar GDP composition, with 4% agriculture, 26% industry, and 70% services.

[High emissions climate change projections](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/likely-impacts-of-climate-change/overview-of-likely-climate-change-impacts) for New Zealand have not shown a temperature increase as large as those projected for Australia, while rainfall will dramatically increase in frequency and intensity on South Island while slightly decreasing on North Island. Though its cities are coastal, the [18-59 cm projected rise in sea levels through 2100 has not been deemed a significant threat](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/climate-change-effects-and-impacts-assessment-guidance-manual-local-51). Owing to the country being so far south, climate change impacts are not expected to be stressful and might bring increased productivity in agriculture.

&nbsp;

**Papua New Guinea**

Papua New Guinea is a country of 7 million with an equatorial climate. Its population has been projected to continue growing linearly and it is [expected to experience a demographic windfall](https://www.populationpyramid.net/papua-new-guinea/2100/) as its currently bottom-heavy population pyramid matures over this century. As a third-world country, Papua New Guinea still relies heavily on agriculture (22% of GDP) and industry (43%). 

Like most other countries, Papua New Guinea is [expected to see an increase in temperature (2.2 - 3.4C by 2090, high emissions scenario), changing rainfall patterns, and a rise in sea levels](https://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/14_PCCSP_PNG_8pp.pdf). There will likely be a decrease in tropical cyclones, though they will be more intense, and there will be more days with extreme rainfall. Due to its low level of development, these changes, though not as extreme as other countries, are expected to deal higher damage to the economy.

&nbsp;

**Melanesia (sans Papua New Guinea), Micronesia, and Polynesia**

Without [adequate historical data](https://adaptation-undp.org/explore/melanesia), projection of [future climate changes are uncertain](https://www.adaptation-undp.org/explore/micronesia). Based on the limited data available, what can be said with some confidence is that these areas are expected to see 1.0 - 3.1C increases in temperature by the end of the century and will see mildly rising sea levels (0.19 - 0.58m). Because these island nations have economies based on agriculture, subsistence, and some industry, it is likely that they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and will see large amounts of dislocation.

#Questions

* New Zealand is currently experiencing mass emigration to Australia. With climate change due to affect Australia much harder than New Zealand, will we see a reverse in this trend in the future? 

* As a follow-up to the previous question: there are billionaires such as Peter Thiel [who see New Zealand as ""the future""](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand) and have built retreats (in a literal sense) there in an apparent attempt to safeguard themselves from civilizational collapse. Although the linked article doesn't mention climate change, given the information presented above, New Zealand does seem like a relatively-stable and isolated safe-haven, with the bonus of being picturesque. Assuming there will be an influx of ultra high net worth individuals into New Zealand, how will the country's status and relations change? Will it become some sort of ""Monaco of Oceania""?

* Papua New Guinea shares an island with Indonesia, which dwarfs it on every metric. I am not familiar with Indoesia-Papua New Guinea relations, but what are the chances that Indonesia will somehow annex a Papua New Guinea that has been weakened by climate change?

* With 28.5% of its population foreign-born, Australia is the major western nation with the highest amount of immigration. Putting aside immigrants from allied countries like New Zealand and the United Kingdom, China is the largest source of migrants. Tensions between China and the west is rising and there is strong evidence that China is seeking to exert control over Australian politics using the local diaspora. How will climate change affect this geopolitical struggle, if at all?

As the region is composed of fifteen countries, essay-like introductions are impractical. Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to parse relevant information and citations from UNFCCC communications that are only available in French.

&nbsp;

#Observations

* The region has a fragmented political layout, with many countries crammed along its coastline. Some countries have a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, where it can be said that most of the country is very close to a border. An extreme example is The Gambia, which is a sliver of land carved out of Senegal. Togo and Benin also fall under this category with their elongated profiles. In my opinion, these countries will have significant trouble enforcing their borders, which will lead to vulnerabilities in terms of resource protection and managing refugee inflows and outflows. 

* Roughly half of the region's capital cities are located on the coast, which makes them vulnerable to sea level rise and its impacts, such as higher flood surges. This includes Senegal's Dakar, Guinea-Bissau's Bissau, Guinea's Conakry, Sierra Leone's Freetown, Liberia's Monrovia, Ghana's Accra, and Togo's Lome.

* The region is exceptionally poor (arguably the poorest region surveyed thus far) and undeveloped (as reflected by the population pyramids), with the vast majority of countries at or around $2,000 GDP PPP per capita and with very high poverty rates. Agriculture plays a large role in the region's economy--as large a role as in Eastern Africa.

* There is an abundance of agricultural land in the region, including a large amount of arable land. However, farming practices in the region are generally inefficient and low-tech. Significant amounts of crops rely on rainfall instead of irrigation, on top of being water inefficient in general. This means that the increased variability in rainfall patterns run the risk of having outsized impacts on the agricultural sector, on top of other climate change-related impacts. Climate change also threatens the some northern countries in the region such as Senegal, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso with desertification. Food insecurity is already a feature of the region--climate change is likely to exacerbate this. 

* Renewable internal freshwater resources per capita is relatively low--especially when compared with water-rich Central Africa. Though there are countries with higher amounts of this statistic, such as Guinea (19,000), Sierra Leone (23,000), and Liberia (46,000).

* In line with the rest of the continent, populations are expected to boom, with roughly four-fold increases over the century being the norm.

* Due to the points above, this writer's outlook for the region is not one of optimism, to put it mildly.

Some of you might have noticed that I haven't posted the discussion on North Africa yet. I've been busy, so I've been pushing back the post even though the spreadsheet is mostly finished. Things will continue to be hectic for the next week or so, so I thought I'd at least find an excuse to give anyone reading this series a quick update. 

This wouldn't be an appropriate post without something more substantial, so I've decided to announce the second part of this series earlier than I planned. 

The first part of the series has been focusing on the direct (or first-order) impacts of climate change--this is reflected by its focus on the effects that temperature change, rainfall pattern change, sea level rise, and extreme climactic events might have on basic human necessities such as food and water. As some of you might have noticed, this isn't strictly in the spirit of this sub and of geopolitics in general, as things like relationships between countries have been largely absent from the posts. 

The second part of this series will focus on indirect (or second-order) impacts of climate change on various countries. This part will take the findings of the first part and build on it by taking into account additional information like military might, economic strength, soft power, foreign relations to gain a broad idea of how certain countries are more likely to behave when the grand chessboard morphs. I must stress that I'm just a casual dabbler in geopolitics (I studied something far different) doing this for fun and that nothing I write should be taken too seriously.

The second part will likely premiere soon after the conclusion of the first. As that is still months away, I don't have concrete answers to questions like 'What countries will be included?' and 'What form will it take?' 

As usual, suggestions are always welcome.",geopolitics,climate change
65,Is African population boom destined to be curse on Africa?,37.0,boxzeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/boxzeu/is_african_population_boom_destined_to_be_curse/,31.0,1557927121.0,"As you know, African population has been increasing explosively. In 1900, there are only 140 million people in Africa. In 2017, population of Africa is beyond 1 billion - precisely 1.26 billion. Just in one century, Africa succeeded to regenerate its population ninefold. It is not the end of population explosion. According to [2017 UN projection](https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_Wallchart.pdf), African population will be 2.53 billion by 2050 and 4.47 billion by 2100 - extra fourfold population growth is not yet even realized. Of course, the speed of population growth is becoming smoother because of the decline of fertility rate in Africa, but we cannot dismiss this significant level of projected growth rate.

&#x200B;

In this situation, I'm sincerely concerned about the future of Africa. These population oppression on Africa would cause disastrous effect on African continent - food and water shortage, rapid slumisation of urban area, tribal grievance, etc. Of course, despite of ninefold population growth, Africa at least managed to feed their population in minimum level (don't say some devastating famines and civil wars - it is almost impossible to avoid these catastrophes) for last century. Technology development on irrigation and agriculture, investment on infrastructure and global aid made African continent not to be collapsed. However, I cannot guarantee that Africa will be still fine in next 100 years just like last century. We cannot conclude in simple extrapolation because we cannot know that much whether these progress will be maintained or not. Moreover, climate change would significantly offset these positive trends - [Africa is the most endangered region in climate change](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/verisk%20index.pdf). African continent - mostly of arid or tropical climate zone - is generally very prone for any creatures to face existential crisis in climate change case because of climate susceptibility in volatile situation. When we consider African endemic problems - lack of economical wealth, failure on nation-building, widespread corruption, oppressive politics, lack of social capital, etc, - these crises could be devolved into apocalypse level. This risk is not negligible.

Of course, population boom could be bless for Africa. At least African countries don't have to worry about geopolitical power loss from population decline and rapidly aging population structure like some European and East Asian countries. But I'm not sure this benefit will outweigh the cost of population boom.

Anyway I have a question. Would population explosion be destined to be a disaster for Africa?",geopolitics,climate change

That is not my intention. I am not a scientist nor a professional, therefore I cannot guarantee that all of my data are 100% accurate, however I have been following the situation for a certain period by now.

Africa & Asia are in a population boom, and for many countries in these respective continents, there is no end of this boom in sight. In the meantime, the ice is melting, many vital coastal areas will eventually get flooded, both local and continent-wide weather events are going to become more dynamic, less predictable and more extreme. Cape Town is the first city which is suffering from fresh water disruptions due to what seems to be climate change's effect and more cities will suffer from these problems. 

As we all know, wealthier and more educated countries drastically reduce the number of children a woman has. However, this is a process that takes decades. Current predictions for population of Nigeria and other African and Asian countries show a significant increase which will occur during times of religious, economical (every economical crisis is a question of 'when' and not 'if') and now it will become also water and food crisis. With such swathes of population, in 'the midst' of a significant climate change, an enormous people are predicted to be going North - Europe. This will have a tremendous effect on internal politics of every European country. Rise of ideological and religious extremism, polarization of society and so on. This is, of course, avoidable. But this requires time. And the question is - do we have the time?

The eventual migration is, of course, avoidable as well. Naval blockades, creation of very strict external EU borders, and other means to which elites will have to resort to, unless they will want to be casted out by extremists whose popularity will rise depending on the severity of the migrant situation. This could even potentially lead to racial/ethnic tensions that would lead to violent deportations and God-forbid even genocides committed by the army, police, parties or even people themselves. This grim situation could cause intl. economical or political organizations to lose value and fade away and break up, including the EU and the UN. At that point, when such institutions disappear, the situation will become even grimmer. 

This is all solveable at least to some margin. But can we make a significant change? Do we have the time and willingness to help these countries in order to lower their birthrates, a factor that would grossly exacerbate the crises to come? Or is it too late for undeveloped countries to get developed and will they therefore crumble? Or am I exaggerating the situation?

I've been wondering recently about how the recent rise of the far right around the world interacts with the [big sort](http://www.thebigsort.com). 

In the US, we see the left gathering in key cities, apparently a phenomenon around the world.  I'm wondering if there's anything geopolitics can say about political groups that divide along rural/urban boundaries.   There's all sorts of historical examples of cities being attacked from the outside, walled cities, castles etc.  Can we analyze modern cities this way? 


Common wisdom says they're too interdependent but perhaps cultural divide runs a risk of getting out of hand.   We've seen New York and California joke about joining Canada but that's really San Fran, LA and New York City.  . We've also seen the right willing to go it alone instead of rely on globalism and demonize cities recently.  They despise globalism and have started launching laws at ""sanctuary cities.""  Texas has a secession movement

All of this makes me wonder about potential economic or even violent antagonism.  Obviously the cultural antagonism is there and could get worse especially in light of future food shortages due to climate change.

Macau and Hong Kong have been excluded due to their small population and sizes and their status as regions of China, which was discussed two weeks ago.

&nbsp;

**Questions:**

* Mongolia is strategically located between Russia and China and is currently facing a water crisis. As we've discussed two week ago, China is also facing a water crisis, so it is unlikely that China will be able to spare Mongolia some water. Assuming that the water crises deepens in both countries, will Mongolia grow closer to Russia out of a need for water?

* East Asian countries (with the exception of landlocked Mongolia) have a tendency to build major cities on coasts. With sea levels rising and with an increased risk of high waves and storm surges, there is the potential for serious problems. Will there be a mass exodus due to displacement?

* East Asian countries (again, [unless you are the Mongols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqcVro-3f4I)) have significantly aging populaces, which will increase their dependency ratio and cause damage to their economy. One way to deal with this problem is by allowing large amounts of immigrants--however, immigrants and East Asian culture do not get along, as reflected by the vastly homogenous societies (ethnic makeups range from 92% Chinese in China to 98.5% Japanese). Will East Asian countries break character and take in climate refugees to deal with their aging populaces?

The region under discussion is comprised of the following six countries (listed by population; descending):

* Colombia

* Peru

* Venezuela

* Ecuador

* Guyana

* Suriname

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* The region's overall population is projected to grow by roughly 20% by the end of the century, with Peru and Venezuela projected to see their populations grow by roughly a third while Ecuador is projected to see a roughly 50% increase.

* Almost all countries in the region share a common demographic profile due to their development status--their population pyramids are wider in their lower and lower-mid age brackets. Projected population pyramids suggest that it is unlikely countries in the region will experience problems with population aging. It should be noted that Guyana's population pyramid has an erratic profile, with a sharp bulge covering the 10-24 age groups and a less accentuated but prominent one covering the 40-59 age groups.

* The region is below the world average in GDP PPP per capita ($17,500), with countries averaging at $12,500 GDP PPP per capita. With the exception of Guyana, which has a GDP PPP per capita of $8,100, the countries are close to the regional average. The region has a relatively high economic reliance on agriculture, reflecting its developmental status, but it should also be noted that industry makes up a large portion of the major countries' GDPs.

* With the exception of Guyana, which has a large amount of densely populated and utilized coastal lowlands, the region does not seem significantly vulnerable to rises in sea level, which is projected to be on the lower end of global estimates.

* There is a adequate amount of agricultural land in the region overall, with the vast majority of it being permanent pasture. Despite having the highest economic reliance on agriculture, Guyana has a small amount of agricultural land (8.4% of total land) and Suriname has a miniscule amount (0.5%). Climate change is projected to have a generally negative impact on agriculture in the region, with many countries reporting that the sector is the most vulnerable sector or is among the most vulnerable. Peru projects the sector's GDP losses to be 24-33% of GDP by 2100. 

* The region is very rich in freshwater, with an average of 108,041 m3 per capita of internal renewable freshwater per year. Even Venezuela, which has the lowest value, has 26,000 m3 per capita per year, which is around the region's average. For comparison, the world average is 5,900 m3. However, as with all regions, country-scale availability of water does not translate to availability across the country, as the presence and quality of infrastructure to process and transport it must be taken into account. The quality of the water might also be an issue, as temperature increases and salination due to flooding and inundation will likely decrease it.

75,Water Politics in the Nile Basin,31.0,cn6r6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/cn6r6l/water_politics_in_the_nile_basin/,13.0,1565189403.0,"Hey all. Last week I submitted an essay to *The Economist*'s Open Future essay contest. Would love to hear your feedback. The topic was **What fundamental economic and political change, if any, is needed for an effective response to climate change?**  
  
Hope you enjoy!  
  
***  
  
On the banks of the Blue Nile, ten miles from the Ethiopia-Sudan border, a hydroelectric maelstrom is cresting. Designed to provide affordable electricity to tens of millions, and symbolic of its country’s march to modernity after decades of mismanagement, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will be Africa’s largest renewable power station upon its completion in 2022. And yet, since Ethiopia began construction eight years ago, the megaproject has attracted a torrent of controversy, including squabbles over colonial-era treaties, an alleged assassination, and the explicit threat of Egyptian airstrikes. These core anxieties are linked to a changing climate and a surge in hydrological extremes for which regional governments are either unwilling or unable to prepare.  
  
To understand the tensions surrounding the project, look to the Greek historian Herodotus, who described Egypt as “a gift of the river.” So important is the Nile’s annual flood, that rather than base its year on a solar cycle, the ancient civilization’s calendar revolved around seasonal changes to the river, a tradition that persists through the present day. The Nile basin sprawls across 11 countries and drains nearly 1.3m square miles — a footprint equivalent to the combined areas of France, Italy, and Spain. In downstream Egypt and Sudan, 95% of inhabitants live on the river’s banks, relying upon regular flooding for crop irrigation and sustenance.  
  
These dependencies have been exacerbated in recent years, owing to an increasingly erratic flooding season. In 2017, researchers from MIT concluded that future fluctuations in the Nile’s annual flow will increase by 50% compared with 20th century averages, wholly due to climate change. Already known for its capricious nature since the time of Joseph and Pharaoh, the exaggerated swings will make it difficult for farmers to survive more frequent droughts and deluge.  
  
Originating in Ethiopia, the Blue Nile is the largest tributary of the Nile basin and was first identified as the site of a potential dam in the 1950s. Decades of civil war and famine shelved development until 2011, when an Italian engineering firm won a $4.8bn contract to construct the GERD. With its current power grid accessible to only 44% of its population, Ethiopia sees the 6,500 MW project as a means to simultaneously electrify its entire populace and court foreign investors interested in establishing a manufacturing presence in the country.  
  
Instead of plaudits, the GERD has garnered outrage from politicians downriver, who decry the dam as in violation of Victorian era treaties governing the river’s water rights. Egypt and Sudan worry that filling the dam’s reservoir will severely limit the Nile’s flow for years, cutting off crops and people from their only water source. For its part, Ethiopia dismisses these agreements as antiquated decrees imposed by the former British Empire and its vassal states, and has proceeded with construction over its neighbors’ objections. In response, Egypt has threatened to launch preemptive airstrikes on the GERD to forestall any water shortages, and just last year, the dam’s chief engineer was found dead in his car from a gunshot wound to the head.  
  
The crux of the problem lies in the region’s inefficient allocation of water and the refusals of relevant parties to negotiate. Though its territory is 90% desert, Egypt is Africa’s largest exporter of rice, and previous efforts to reduce the country’s dependence on the water-thirsty crop were quietly repealed in March in response to rising food prices. One month later, neighboring Sudan saw its authoritarian leader deposed after a dismal flooding season forced the government to remove a subsidy on grain, triggering a coup d’état. 

Worryingly, the aforementioned treaties already grant the two countries the lion’s share of water rights. Egypt alone claims two-thirds of the Nile’s flow, despite comprising only 30% of the basin’s population. Ethiopia meanwhile has for years refused to negotiate its position, claiming the right to develop its section of the river and declining to use its membership in the multilateral Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) to argue its case.  
  
Since 2011, the political situation in the Nile basin has deteriorated dramatically. Egypt has experienced two government coups in the aftermath of the Arab Spring; Sudan, once an informal liaison between its powerful neighbors, clings to a fragile ceasefire between civilian activists and a military junta that risks cascading into civil war; Ethiopia’s gambit to reform both its economy and society threatens to tear the country apart through the rise of dozens of resurgent separatist movements. The Nile’s increasingly volatile flow, coupled with the water-rights dispute, fuels these crises and without negotiations between the three countries, the conflicts will not ebb.  
  
There is hope on the horizon. Egypt has hired outside experts to improve its agricultural efficiencies, and Ethiopia has signaled a willingness to reopen talks on the GERD, well in advance of the planned 2022 completion date. Further steps must be taken to offset the risks of war, drought, and famine.  
  
To start, Ethiopia must assure its neighbors that it will use the dam only for power generation— not irrigation, given its wider range of water sources. It also must negotiate through the NBI and craft a consensus among interested parties, rather than act unilaterally. To sweeten the deal, it can offer Egypt and Sudan discounts on power exports, for which the downstream countries have strong need.  
  
At the same time, Egypt must relinquish claims to the vast majority of Nile River rights and renegotiate a new usage treaty through the NBI. This agreement will allocate water proportionate to a country’s population, while taking into consideration alternative water sources. The country must encourage greater hydrological efficiencies through research and foreign investment.  
  
The struggle on the Nile to strike a balance between progress and sustainability can be viewed as a microcosm of the world’s efforts to mitigate the effects of a rapidly changing climate. For a society to lift the livelihoods of its poorest denizens while maintaining a habitable environment for future generations, all interested parties must cooperate and seek efficient compromises in the allocation of limited resources.",geopolitics,climate change

As the region is composed of fourteen countries, essay-like introductions are impractical. Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. French territories have not been included.

#Observations

*Questions have been replaced by observations, which presents patterns, trends, and other observations that stood out when compiling information for the general introduction. This is more constructive than having me flaunt my ignorance while trying to come up with engaging questions for regions I know little about.*

* With the exception of Mauritius and Seychelles --two comparatively tiny countries-- the region is very poor, with average GDP PPP per capita well below $4,600. Despite that, populations are expected to see explosive growth over the century, with large populations like Tanzania projected to see a more than five-fold increase over this century. Agriculture still dominates economies and livelihoods, with many major countries having agriculture represent more than 30% of their GDP (with Somalia reaching 60%), while most others are in the twenties. These countries are still very low in the value chain, and it is doubtful whether they have the resources to adapt with little political upheaval, especially considering the likely population boom.

* Many of these countries are home to massive amounts of agricultural land, with Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Mauritius, and Comoros containing 34-47% arable land. Other countries, such as Somalia and Djibouti, contain vast amounts of permanent pasture (69% and 73%, respectively), while Sudan and South Sudan are 84% and 100% permanent pasture, apparently.

* Projections provided in UNFCCC communications have temperatures reach up to 3.3 C by 2100

* Rainfall is projected to increase across the region. The region is the subject of a paradox, called 'the East African rainfall paradox' [(source p8)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FCFA_Tanzania_ClimateBrief_Web.pdf), because observations have conflicted with most climate models--though rainfall is projected to increase in most of the region, there is an observed drying trend between March and May. 

* Water scarcity is already a current issue in many countries in the region, and likely to become a bigger problem due to climate change. On top of other problems, water shortages will also hinder countries' adaptation to climate change, since the resource is important to that endeavor. Though the reports examined have been based on modeling, if the East African rainfall paradox mentioned above is due to modeling deficiencies and rainfall will actually decrease, it would be devastating to populations in the region.

* Agriculture and food security are at major risk when considering the projected population boom and adverse effects of climate change on crop yields. It has been noted that farming practices in sub-Saharan Africa are inefficient, [especially in terms of water use](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Africa_Country_WF_Profiles_briefing_FINAL.pdf), so it is possible that improvements can mitigate some issues.

80,How Should the USA be engaging China? (Based on Destined For War),26.0,8vayyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8vayyq/how_should_the_usa_be_engaging_china_based_on/,59.0,1530461827.0,"I just finished the book Destined For War by [Graham Allison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_T._Allison) . There he argues that the US and China are stuck in Thucydides's Trap, or when a rising power comes into conflict with an existing power (Athens vs Sparta, Germany vs Britain, China vs US).

So the question becomes what should the US do to prevent a devastating military conflict that risks all out nuclear war? 

First I want detail what Professor Allison states is China's (or more aptly Xi/CCP) goals.

* Bring China back to the power it had before the Opium wars

* Control over greater China region from Xinjiang to Tibet to Taiwan.

* East Asia falling under China's sphere of influence

* Respect from other great powers.

The CCP and Xi Jinping want China to be one of the, if not the biggest, great power on the world. To be not just the center of economic growth but culture as well. Professor Allison also notes that China's name in Chinese can translate to Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth. Xi views their Eastern Confucian Authoritarianism as equal, if not better, than Western Liberal Democracy. As such they do not like current international organizations as they ""promote"" Western Liberal Democracy and were created without Chinese input.

Professor Allison then explains how Xi will achieve these goals

* Cleaning the CCP of corruption

* Revising Chinese nationalism and patrioism

* Sustaining unsustainable economic growth

* Growing China's military so it can ""fight and win."" 

This can be seen from Xi's sweep of the party (where he gained more power) to the One Belt one Road project to China occasionally putting troops on India's border. Yet the CCP ties their legitimacy to their economic growth. So long China grows so long the CCP will be in power. Furthermore China has been known to attack stronger opponents when confronted (China's involvement in the Korean War and their attack against the Soviets over border disputes)

To return to the original question ""So the question becomes what should the US do to prevent a devastating military conflict that risks all out nuclear war? ""

The foremost goal of America is to preserve our free nation with our fundamental institutions and values intact. 

does that allow for sharing the Pacific?
or even conceding parts of Asia to China?

Professor Allison states that Washington has little more than a wishlist for what they want to see happen in Asia yet provides 4 methods of engaging China.

* Accommodate

Akin to Britain exempting the US from their ""Two-Power Standard"" (where Britain had just as many Battleships as the next two nations combined). This would mean giving China concessions in areas like Taiwan or the South China Sea in return say a unified, denuclearized Korea under Seoul. The US would accept China's sphere of influence much as the world accepts the US' sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere. 

* Undermine

To enact policies in an attempt to cause a regime change. To support dissidents in China while remaining at arms length from those dissidents (so as to prevent China from either outright attacking America). China's authoritarianism will not be able to keep pace with technology, not so long they keep their current economic growth.

* Negotiate a Long Peace

To pursue long term detentes akin to US-Soviet agreements in the 70s. Agreements covering domestic policy or issues like the South China Sea and Taiwan. Both sides limiting, what the other views, as provocative actions. 

* Redefine the Relationship

To create a relationship based around fighting international terrorism, fighting nuclear proliferation, climate change and other mega threats to both nations.



For me I would advocate for a bit of all of the above.

International order

I would begin by creating a new international organization for the Asian-Pacific Region. Nations like India, Russia, China, US, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, etc. While I cannot tell you the specifics the hope here is that China, having input in how this organization is ran would be more willing to abide by it. Furthermore this would create a forum for any ""spark"" to be discussed giving time to both sides involved hopefully preventing a major conflict. If the UN was to prevent a war in Europe, this would be to prevent a war in the Pacific. This would fall under accommodation 

Mutual Assured Economic Destruction.

The US and China should further tie their economies together. This would make any confrontation in of itself against both nation's interest and if the wealthy are losing money it can push both Beijing and Washington to act a lot quicker in a way that preserves those ties. Furthermore as the Chinese people become wealthier they will demand greater accountability of their government and personal freedoms. Many Chinese students study in the US (i actually met one the other day playing Yugioh XD) this can be a great way of undermining the CCP. By lambasting China's human rights records and praising civil liberties in the US it may compel a few students to return demanding change. This is both accommodation and undermine. 

Detentes and other agreements

Work with China to create agreements on North Korea, US navigation in the South China Sea, Chinese militarization of the South China Sea, and other contested areas. Perhaps the above international organization could assist with such agreements. While also creating plans with China on combating terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the other mega threats listed above. By having both sides agree to these detentes it can free up each side to focus on domestic issues, which fits both parties goals. This is negotiating a long term peace and redefining the relationship.

>#The main characteristics of the four SRES [Special Report Emissions Scenarios] and scenario families

>By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult to imagine – as difficult as it would have been at the end of the 19th century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly different direction for future developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key “future” characteristics such as demographic change, economic development, and technological change. For this reason, their
plausibility or feasibility should not be considered solely on the basis of an extrapolation of current economic, technological, and social trends.

>* The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major
underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups
that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources
(A1B).

>* The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing global population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines.

>* The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population that peaks in midcentury and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives.

>* The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels.

#Excerpt from the Wikipedia article on SRES (tl;dr version of the above)

**A1**

>The A1 scenarios are of a more integrated world. The A1 family of scenarios is characterized by:

>* Rapid economic growth.

>* A global population that reaches 9 billion in 2050 and then gradually declines.

>* The quick spread of new and efficient technologies.

>* A convergent world - income and way of life converge between regions. Extensive social and cultural interactions worldwide.

>There are subsets to the A1 family based on their technological emphasis:

>* A1FI - An emphasis on fossil-fuels (Fossil Intensive).

>* A1B - A balanced emphasis on all energy sources.

>* A1T - Emphasis on non-fossil energy sources.

&nbsp;

**A2**

>The A2 scenarios are of a more divided world. The A2 family of scenarios is characterized by:

>* A world of independently operating, self-reliant nations.

>* Continuously increasing population.

>* Regionally oriented economic development.

&nbsp;

**B1**

>The B1 scenarios are of a world more integrated, and more ecologically friendly. The B1 scenarios are characterized by:

>* Rapid economic growth as in A1, but with rapid changes towards a service and information economy.

>* Population rising to 9 billion in 2050 and then declining as in A1.

>* Reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies.

>* An emphasis on global solutions to economic, social and environmental stability.

&nbsp;

**B2**

>The B2 scenarios are of a world more divided, but more ecologically friendly. The B2 scenarios are characterized by:

>* Continuously increasing population, but at a slower rate than in A2.

>* Emphasis on local rather than global solutions to economic, social and environmental stability.

>* Intermediate levels of economic development.

>* Less rapid and more fragmented technological change than in A1 and B1.

While I worry about that as a self-fulfilling prophecy, I think it's clear to Beijing, Moscow, and Washington that any extensive conflict among them would be borderline suicidal.

Another common strain on this site is that the U.S. is slowly retreating from the international system toward the 'Fortress America' isolationist mentality that was common zeitgeist prior to World War II. This strain is often coupled with a belief that because the American electorate has soured on the current world order, globalization and its resultant de-industrialization, and military free loaders in NATO and the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. will continue to retreat from an idealistic dogma of defending defending democracy and Western ideals, and move toward a hard-edged jingoist realpolitik.

We saw this with Trump and 'America First' and Joe Biden hasn't reversed it much with 'Make it in All of America.' When American national security officials speak of geopolitics, they espouse language that is deeply insular and isolationist. In February, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was asked about the Biden foreign policy regime. His response? “Right now, the most profound national security challenge facing the United States is getting our own house in order, is domestic renewal,” [https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/02/25/joe-bidens-foreign-policy-america-first-twist/4345647001/](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/02/25/joe-bidens-foreign-policy-america-first-twist/4345647001/)

But if China wants Taiwan, Russia wants Ukraine, and the U.S. wants to revive ""Fortress America"" and address the geographic risks of climate change, why can't a Molotov-Ribbentrop arrangement be an option to avoiding Total War?

I don't mean to be provocative or tactless, but in a world where the U.S. is, shall we say, Trumpian nationalist, what is preventing the three powers from negotiating among themselves to step aside as each other aggrieve perceived historical wrongs.?

In this scenario, the U.S. could guarantee China they won't intervene in the military annexation of Taiwan, will recognize Hong Kong as an inviolable part of China, and maybe will look the other way as China takes a bite of Mongolia or the South China Sea. Russia will similarly be promised non-aggression as they seek to finalize the Union State with Belarus and make a go of annexing Ukraine. The U.S., meanwhile, could resolve historical wrongs including by annexing Greenland (which Trump was enamored with), toppling the Havana government and annexing Cuba (reversing the ""great mistake"" - aka Teller Amendment of 1898), and maybe even making a go of annexing Canada, righting the 'lost opportunity' of 1812?

Of course this all might sound outlandish, but is it impossible? The end result, of course, would be a historic betrayal of Washington's foreign ideals since WWII. It would also essentially dissolve the Western alliance, end NATO, and move the world towards a Darwinian reality of might makes right. But I do worry the U.S. people are barreling toward a perspective of ""Why should we defend our NATO allies if they criticize us nonetheless and are vehemently anti-American?""

If the current world order does collapse, does it have to be because of the Thucydides Trap? Or could it be not by bang, but by whimper (to quote T.S. Eliot) - because of a Molotov-Ribbentrop equivalent where China, Russia, and USA do a 21st Century Great Sorting among themselves, while the rest of the world, to quote Thucydides, ""suffer what they must""?

Or would such an agreement by its very nature collapse, much as the original Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not prevent Germany and the USSR from war, but merely delayed it?",geopolitics,climate change

#General Introductions

Central America and the Caribbean have been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook. The region under discussion is comprised of the following seven countries (listed by population; descending):

* Honduras

* Guatemala

* El Salvador

* Nicaragua

* Costa Rica

* Panama

* Belize

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* Populations in the region are generally projected to increase by the end of the century, with El Salvador being the sole exception with a modest decrease projected. Honduras is projected to see a roughly 50% increase, while Guatemala, Panama, and Belize are projected to see roughly 100% increases. Nicaragua and Costa Rica are projected to see modest increases.

* With the minor exception of Costa Rica, countries in the region have population pyramids that are generally bottom-heavy, reflecting their statuses as developing nations. Despite this, El Salvador and Nicaragua seem likely to experience problems related to population aging by the end of the century based on demographic projections, while Honduras and Costa Rica seem likely to experience mild issues.

* The region is impoverished, with GDP (PPP) per capita well below the world average of $17,500, at $11,200. The average has been significantly skewed upwards by Panama, which is a regional outlier at $25,400, as the regional median is $8,200. Honduras and Nicaragua are particularly impoverished, with $5,800 and $5,900. It is notable that Guatemala has a larger percentage of its population living below the poverty line than Haiti, according to the latest available data from both countries. This is notable because Guatemala's GDP (PPP) per capita is more than four times larger than that of Haiti. However, measures of population poverty should be taken with a grain of salt due to limitations and inconsistencies. The region is likely to face problems adapting to climate change due to its vulnerability and low wealth.

* With the exception of Panama and Belize, capital cities in the region are far from coasts, and this seems true of most major population centers as well. The region's two largest countries --Honduras and Guatemala-- have populations that tend to reside in mountainous regions, which limits the impacts of sea level rise. Coasts of the hurricane-prone region are threatened by inundation by storm surges that are exacerbated by sea level rise that will likely lead to destruction of coastal resources and infrastructure. Costa Rica's city of Puntarenas, with a population of 134,000, could have 90% of its residential areas flooded during storms if the sea level rises by a meter, which is considered a conservative projection for the end of the century by some.

* The region is very rich in freshwater, as it has an average of 21,106 m3 per capita per year, while the global average is 5,900 m3. Though there is a large range of values (2,488 m3 to 34,990 m3), even the second-lowest value is substantially above the global average (Guatemala, at 6,858 m3). However, the developing status of these countries means that access to freshwater remains and will likely continue to remain a significant issue for sizeable portions of their populations due to poor or lacking infrastructure, and that aspects of climate change that affects the supply of freshwater, such as changes in precipitation patterns, increased temperature, and salination by seawater inundation, will likely have outsized impacts on the quantity and quality of accessible freshwater for many, if not most.

* Agriculture plays a large role in the economies of the region, contributing more than ten percent to five of the seven countries--including the top four countries by population. With the exception of Belize, there seems to be decent amounts of agricultural land in every country with healthily diversified uses. Most countries in the region produce 3,000 - 7,000 Calories per capita per day, with the exceptions being El Salvador and Panama, which produce less then 3,000. The generally-rainfed nature of agriculture in the region makes it more vulnerable to the instability introduced by climate change. Staple crops such as maize, rice, and beans are generally projected to see yield reductions over the century. Coffee, which is a very important commodity crop in ther region, is relatively sensitive to growing conditions and will likely see its growing zone shift significantly. Given the economic and political significance of agriculture, the relatively low food production, and the impoverishment of the region, food security is likely to be an issue.

I would suggest four main factors to understand the outline of future securely: **demographics, climate change, historical outline and geography**. We cannot dismiss them because they work as an accumulated or inert phenomenon which means that there is almost no chance or at least requiring long-time effort to revoke given conditions. 

**Demographics** is relatively close to destiny because already born people live and influence in specific country for a long time and evicting or massacring specific demographic group is not easy in moral or even practical sense. 

**Climate Change** is hard to evade it because it needs 20 years for the capacity of present gas emissions to influence global ecology system so the attempt to reduce climate change is not easily shown in effort. Moreover, the effort to alleviate future climate change is really hard to accomplish because it needs all global countries to participate and cooperate in one goal without almost any exception but it is extremely hard to anticipate that in the present world order and international institutions. 

**Historical outline** is already given by the past of thousands or hundreds years of specific country. Regardless of the interpretation and positive research of history, the history is already determined in material and ideal aspect of the country.

Not to mention **geography** because it is so obvious.

#General Introductions

Central America and the Caribbean have been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook.

Countries that are overseas territories of other countries (e.g. Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe) and countries that contain less than 0.5% of the region's total population have been excluded for expediency. Guyana and Suriname have been included in last week's discussion covering western and northern South America, while Belize will be included in next week's discussion covering Central America. 

The region under discussion is comprised of the following seven countries (listed by population; descending):

* Cuba

* Haiti

* Dominican Republic

* Jamaica

* Trinidad and Tobago

* The Bahamas

* Barbados

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

*  Populations in the region are generally projected to see modest changes over the century, with some seeing decreases (Cuba, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados) and others seeing increases (Haiti, Dominican Republic, The Bahamas). Jamaica is a notable exception to this, as it is projected to see its population halve over the century, reaching 1965 levels.

* Population pyramids indicate that the region is generally developing, with many pyramids being significantly skewed towards younger age ranges. Cuba and Barbados are the exceptions, as the former has a bimodal distribution and the latter is relatively flat.

* The region is at the world average in GDP (PPP) per capita ($17,500). Trinidad and Tobago and The Bahamas are relatively wealthy, each having more than $30,000 GDP (PPP) per capita, while Jamaica has $9,200 and Haiti has a staggering $1,800, making it one of the poorest countries in the world and a major outlier among new world countries covered so far. The region is likely to face problems adapting to climate change due to its high vulnerability and relatively low wealth.

* The region is poor in freshwater, as the average per capita renewable internal freshwater is 2,221 cubic meters per year. This is less than half of the global average of 5,900 cubic meters per year. Barbados has an especially low amount of this statistic, at 282 cubic meters per year, while Cuba and Jamaica have the highest amount, at 3,332 and 3,780 cubic meters per year, respectively. It seems likely that climate change will cause the region to experience water stress, as countries generally project reductions in precipitation and increased temperatures. Sea level rise (discussed below), when combined with hurricanes, will likely cause salination of water reserves through inundation.

* Larger countries in the region contain a decent proportion of agricultural land, with a varied and balanced mix of pasture and arable land. Smaller countries generally have much less agricultural land, percentage-wise, with The Bahamas being only 1.4% agricultural land. Despite the variety, all countries in the region produce less than 3,000 Calories of food per capita per day. With the exception of Haiti, agriculture plays a relatively small role in the regions economies. Climate change is expected to negatively affect agriculture in the region, largely due to increased water stress and flooding. Because of its significant impoverishment leading to already high rates of malnutrition, climate change ""could devastate Haiti’s overall food and economic security without adoption of appropriate adaptation measures"".

* The region is comprised of many island nations with significant proportions of their populations living at or near coasts, and with coastal attractions are significant drivers of its economies. Sea level rise, combined with the high incidence of hurricanes and the low altitude of the land, can cause major changes to land use (e.g. reducing agricultural land) and salination of water reserves. There is a wide variation in projected sea level rise, with some, like Cuba, projecting a 20-35 cm rise by 2100, while others project rises of around 40-70 cm.

#Questions

* As with South Asia and Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula already faces significant water stress which will worsen--both over time and with the instability brought on by climate change. Judging by the region's renewable internal freshwater resources per capita, their problems will be much more dire because they are dependent on variable rainfall and rapidly-depleting aquifers. This problem will be greatly exacerbated by their developing economies, growing populations, and evapotranspiration from extreme heat. Despite the relative wealth of many countries in the region, desalination and importation cannot provide a comprehensive solution. How might they deal with the problem?

* Given the similar challenges Muslim countries face, as well as their close geographical proximities, will Muslim countries band together or become more distanced due to climate change? Or will the status quo prevail?

* How might the wealth of many of these nations aid in the mitigation of and adaptation to the effects of climate change? 

* How might resource-depletion exacerbate the stability of this particular region, which is already conflict-prone?

Which one between the North and South will be ahead and fair better over time?,24.0,gs4eo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gs4eo4/if_the_eu_splits_then_will_it_be_a_northern/,32.0,1590664678.0,"This is something that came up in my previous post discussing [what will emerge if the EU unravels](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gqlozc/what_will_emerge_if_the_eu_unravels/) and is a separately important thing in itself so I thought a separate post is needed.

Basically the idea flows from the belief that the status quo in the EU is not tenable anymore and a life or death moment is looming following the coming coronavirus induced economic turmoil where Italy will be the one to decide that enough is enough and it's either a fiscal union or the Lira. In this case the northern countries either agree to that and the EU becomes more centralized and moves toward federalization or they refuse and disintegration begins. Italy quits the Eurozone and the shock of a founding member and one of the largest country getting out ends up leading to further exits and the EU unravels.

Now assuming it goes like that (which I consider likely) France emerges as the decisive country in deciding what the order in Europe will look like after eu as we know it is gone. It has the choice to either continue the Franco-German alliance and together with the rest of the northwestern countries form a smaller federal eu state or head southward and establish a Latin Bloc with Italy, Spain and Portugal as the dominant member.

In the case of the latter happening the EU neatly ends up splitting along a Latin-Germanic line with a French dominated Bloc in the South and a German dominated one in the North while the Eastern countries go their separate ways. Belgium is certain to be split and Wallonia goes to France while Flanders goes north under this scenario. What emerges in the North unlike in the South is more complicated. In addition to close relationship between Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Flanders, Luxembourg Scandinavia can also be expected to join in with the northern bloc but it can also go in a more politically neutral direction. It is then inevitable that Eastern Europe will become a playground for influence between great powers and different states will go different ways. I believe that at least the Czech republic which is highly integrated, right next to and relatively small for Germany to handle will be pulled into whatever northern Bloc Germany is leading.

The arguments as to why France may go the Latin route instead of staying with Germany are:

- The postwar European integration happened because of the decline of Western European countries. France tried to stop it's decline by aligning with (then West) Germany which eventually evolved into the present EU. The EU is ultimately German dominated where the junior role of France is covered up by France acting through the Franco-German alliance that dominates the rest of the EU. In this scenario where much of the EU disintegrates and a federal state between the northwestern countries is formed the Franco-German alliance will come to an end as Germany alone will be able to dominate that. I believe France may not accept this and instead opt to go South to form a Latin Bloc in which it will be the dominant member.

- The present economic arrangement is dominated by Germany and favors the North. This is the main source of North-South tensions in the status quo that has seen the South economically strangled. It is not just Italy and Spain but increasingly France as well that is losing out economically and [debt is piling up](https://www.france24.com/en/20190628-france-sinks-deeper-debt) there too. Getting out of the Euro and forming a separate bloc will alleviate some of that economic pain by not having to compete with superior German industry alongside some protectionism and a monetary union that though French dominated would still be more oriented and helpful towards the southern economies.

- The matter of sub Saharan climate migration is one where there is going to be a divergence in urgency. The Latin countries are all Mediterranean facing and will be drawn towards the Maghreb to hold back migration, this by itself is something that will lead to future closeness between France and Italy, Spain, Portugal. However none of the northern countries have a Mediterranean border and can just shut the border and sit back quietly. The South will do the job by itself while the North shielded by it can take advantage of the situation and let them unavoidably drain their resources.

The result of this happening is the emergence of two competing power blocs. The Latin Bloc will have between 190 to 200 million people and the Northern one depending on the arrangement between 115 to 150 million people. Economically in terms of gdp again they will be closely matched but heavily in favor of the North if Scandinavia and the Czech republic are included in it while the industrial sector will be one where the North will stay dominant anyhow. Militarily the Latin Bloc will emerge superior in all sectors initially though the land and air forces will eventually be matched and perhaps even be exceeded as German led remilitarization happens in the North. Navally the South is however more likely to stay ahead. They will be far ahead at the beginning, have far away overseas territories and will be getting drawn to North Africa to deal with sub Saharan African migration unlike the North which would be more continent oriented so the South will be inclined to investing in the naval sector more than the North. From how I see it they will be closely matched with the South having between 30 to 70 percent demographic advantage and an initial across the board military superiority that will even out at least in land and air as the Northern military or militaries expand, superior northern industrial capacity against superior southern demographics will have an interesting to see effect on which army is superior after the initial northern military expansion. In economic terms the North will lead but won't be overwhelmingly ahead.

The split between the two sides will obviously see them drift apart and become rivals. It will deepen if disputes erupt over the fate of Brussels and South Tyrol. Overtime as sub saharan African climate migration becomes the top issue it will become so in a far more immediate way for the South. Unlike the Northern Bloc with no Mediterranean coast the southern ones are all Mediterranean countries and they will inevitably be drawn to the Maghreb to hold back migration. Here I think the North will simply just offer some token help and have the South and the Maghreb do the work of stopping migration. They will be existentially necessitated to do so and will be able to by themselves but will be getting economically drained because of the extensive amount of resources that will have to be deployed leading to losing economic ground to the North.

Now given all this the questions are:

- How likely do you think a North-South split of the EU is and why or why not?

- How do you expect the split to grow in the future?

- Who do you think is going to be the leading one between the two and how will the rivalry play out including in their relations with Eastern Europe and the rest of the world?

Lastly on the matter of demographics it seems to me likely that Latin American migrants especially from economically lagging and soon to be hit by climate change countries will become a thing in Europe. The lagging birthrate pressures for it and Latin America remains the only source from where massive numbers can be allowed in without the destabilization that middle Eastern or African migrants bring. In this case the Latin Bloc is culturally better prepared to use this source than the North. Thoughts on this?",geopolitics,climate change
97,A question on immigration,28.0,ccx8gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ccx8gi/a_question_on_immigration/,38.0,1563067684.0,"Kishore Mahubhani warned as far back as the 1990s that the income disparities between Europe and Africa would drive migration from Africa to Europe. Already this is happening. Europeans are now so fed up with migration from Africa that they are now criminalizing those who attempt to rescue migrants. They've gotten to a point where they no longer care if migrants drown or are bombed in Libya.

Similar sentiments now apply to Americans, with respect to people from Central America. We can see the immigration issue is now front and center and many Americans have lost their traditional tolerance.

Immigration, not terrorism is now the front burner issue in Western politics.

Some Western politicians like Rory Stewart are of the opinion that there is nothing that can be done except preventing the immigrants from coming. His thesis is quite simple; climate change will wreak havoc on Africa, and Africans will want to move - the only thing that can be done, is to stop them. ""Africa's true borders begin in the Sahara"".

Similar sentiments in the USA - simply ""build the wall"" and forget about migrants from Central America.

Now I am not in any way suggesting that Americans or Europeans have any responsibility to admit or take care of Africans or Central Americans - that is the responsibility of their respective governments, but what in your opinion, would the best way forward be - simply tightening border security and restricting access and what long-term impact would this have on Europe - Africa and US - Central America relations?",geopolitics,climate change
98,Trump’s Latest Trade Tantrum: What Do Tariffs Threats Mean for US-Mexico Relations,25.0,bvce5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bvce5q/trumps_latest_trade_tantrum_what_do_tariffs/,11.0,1559333966.0," On May 30th 2019, President Donald Trump announced a [new](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/30/18646618/tariff-mexico-asylum-trump-usmca) series of tariffs on products coming from Mexico as a response to the Central American Migration crisis. Unless Mexico substantially reduces flows of migrants, Mexico will face a 5% tariff on June 10th, a 10% tariff on July 1st, a 15% tariff on August 1st, and 20% tariff on September 1st, finally rising to 25% tariffs on October 1st. Over the last year, the United States has seen a major surge in Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States. In April of 2019, the US border patrol apprehended 109,144 migrants attempting to cross the southwest border, a number [double](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration) that for April of 2018. Unlike previous [waves](https://qz.com/1563550/border-crisis-why-people-from-honduras-and-guatemala-are-fleeing/)of border migration, which primarily consisted of single men from Mexico, the current wave is primarily unaccompanied children and families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

The massive wave of migration is driven by extreme violence and hunger in these Central American countries. Honduras and El Salvador have the two highest homicide [rates](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/vc.ihr.psrc.p5?most_recent_value_desc=true) in the world, with homicide rates of 83 and 57 per 100,000 respectively. Rates of violence are comparable to [war zones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/04/world/americas/honduras-gang-violence.html) such as Afghanistan and Syria, and large swathes of the country are outside the effective control of the state. Guatemala is suffering from crippling drought, and rains have failed in the last three years in [part](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/drought-climate-change-force-guatemalans-migrate-to-us/) due to global climate change. Many families are reduced to eating one meal a day, and [1.4 ](https://reliefweb.int/report/guatemala/erratic-weather-patterns-central-american-dry-corridor-leave-14-m-people-urgent)million people are in desperate of food aid. The migrant crisis is something I want to discuss in much greater detail in a future podcast episode. However, I want to emphasize that by US law and treaty obligations the United States [must](https://www.rescue.org/article/it-legal-cross-us-border-seek-asylum) allow those with credible fears of violence and persecution to seek asylum and live in the United States while courts adjudicate their claims.

It is unclear what Mexico can do to stem the flow of migrants. The United States has [long](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/30/18646618/tariff-mexico-asylum-trump-usmca) called Mexico to invest more in border security, and take stronger action against organizations helping migrants cross through Mexico. The biggest demand is Mexico sign a “Safe Third Country” agreement with the United States whereby the United States will be able to quickly deport people as Central American countries have [already](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/02/us-push-designate-mexico-safe-third-country-refugees-is-farce/) passed through a safe country. However, it is far from clear that Mexico is a safe country. Mexico has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, with a rate of 28 per 100,000, and rates of murder have [soared](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687579971/mexico-reports-highest-ever-homicide-rate-in-2018-tops-33-000-investigations) by 9% in the first quarter of 2019. Given that socially vulnerable groups such as migrants are especially at risk from violent crime, it is clear that Mexico isn’t a safe country. What is less clear is how Mexico’s fiercely nationalistic president AMLO will respond to the [escalation](https://www.axios.com/trump-mexico-tariffs-amlo-response-letter-df6bff84-4b7e-4df5-bf4f-6c292b678ee2.html) and it does not seem that he will immediately accede to all US demands/

The dramatic rise in tariffs has the potential to severely disrupt the Mexican economy. Mexico exported $345 billion of good to the United States in 2018. While [avocados](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/how-much-trumps-mexico-tariffs-could-cost-you.html) and tequila are the most obvious Mexican imports, Mexico plays a vital role in the global automotive value chain. 16% of all parts used in US car factories are made in Mexico, and the full implementation of 25% tariffs would raise the price of cars by $1,300. Many labor intensive parts such as wire harnesses are made in Mexico, and the ability to cheaply source labor intensive components from Mexico actually make American factories [more](https://www.abc15.com/news/national/every-american-auto-factory-depends-on-mexican-parts-to-build-its-cars-or-trucks) competitive. Unsurprisingly, global financial markets have reacted to new threats of tariffs. The Dow Jones is down by [over](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/) 300 points and Mexican stock indexes by close to [600](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EMXX/) points. The Mexican economy was already in the doldrums, with the economy [contracting](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-economy-gdp/mexican-economy-shrinks-in-first-quarter-economists-downgrade-outlook-idUSKCN1SU1KX)by .2% in the first quarter of 2019. Rising tariffs could easily tip Mexico into a deep recession. Ironically, president Trump’s actions to reduce migration from Central America might end up driving impoverished Mexicans to migrate to the United States.

99,[Series] Geopolitics and Climate Change: Scheduling changes,25.0,98cin8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/98cin8/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_scheduling/,4.0,1534606457.0,"I decided to make this announcement a separate post because I don't want tomorrow's post to become overwhelmingly long. This post is obviously not strictly about geopolitics, so I hope the mods will allow this.

&nbsp;

This week's post was meant to cover Southeast Asia, but due to changes in how countries and regions are covered; due to the embarassing fact that South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan --globally-significant actors-- have been left out of the schedule entirely; and since we have recently discussed China; I have decided to delay Southeast Asia to instead focus on East Asia. This will allow readers to get a more holistic picture of the region and is in line with the rules used to formulate the schedule that will be discussed. Apologies to those who were looking forward to discussing Southeast Asia this week--especially to /u/OleToothless.

&nbsp;

The old schedule was a hastily-cobbled-together list of regions plus Russia and China. There were three reasons for this: it is simply impractical to write weekly posts for every single country, doing so would take away from the larger picture of how climate change will affect the global chessboard, and due to my [original impetus for creating this series](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91p63g/eu_migration_crisis_general_discussion/e323rst/). However, regions containing geopolitical giants like the United States and India would have their introductions and discussions utterly dominated by those countries, with regional neighbors being relegated to being mere afterthoughts (Canadians: ""we're used to it"") even though they might be geopolitically significant and worth discussing, and it would be unfair since China and Russia were given individual posts. Other problems arising from an oversimplistic regional discussion should have been dealt with by the changes listed below.

&nbsp;

There are four types of changes to the schedule: 

* Geopolitical giants have been carved out of their regional posts and given their own posts to give the rest some breathing space. In the case of North America, Mexico has been lumped with Central America, while Canada has been given its own post.

* Where a region is dominated by a single country in such a way that discussion of the region without the country would be unproductive (e.g. Oceania sans Australia), the regional posts have not been split, but will mainly focus on that country.

* Regions that do not have geopolitical giants but contain too many countries have been split. I foolishly tried to cover Africa in a single post, which has now been split into its five constituent regions.

* Posts have been sorted so that regions will be covered in a way that moves westward from the International Date Line and from south to north, giving priority to completing coverage of a region.

&nbsp;

With the changes, the number of scheduled posts have doubled from 11 to 22, with the final post --a global overview of everything we've discussed-- set for December 30th. Discussing the global ramifications of climate change will likely be the exact opposite of being cheerful and festive, so I'm considering pushing it back a week or two so that the cynical, jaded, machiavellian, realist discussions won't be affected by pesky holiday joy. In its stead, we might discuss how Greenland & Antarctica will be affected, and how Santa might replace his elves with much more disposable climate refugees.

&nbsp;

I'm not sure how to divvy up Europe, so I'll use a simplistic 'east-west' division for now--suggestions are always welcome.

&nbsp;

*P.S. Things have been settling down for me, so I'll be able to put more time into future posts and respond to more comments, unlike last week.*

Some people may [think:] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdBcsdk8pEY)

Others are slightly more excited.

Here I'm going to try and positionate myself as a neutral observer. I might fail though xD

*The Catalan Question:*

PART 1:

Origins: Keep in mind that Spain can be divided into three main blocks: West: Portugal, Center: Castille. East: Aragon. That and the world-class anomaly that is the Basquenland. The differences between those three blocks are ethnical, linguistic and cultural.

But were they inevitable, historically speaking? No. Spain could be now like France, which is *une et indivisible*. If we take the Castillian perspective, things were 'done right' in France. A policy of centralization was done since the earlier times of when the HRE was the 'Frankish' Empire. The right to subjucate culturally. Centralization that only became apparent with the Bourbons and Louis XIV, went official with the 1st Republic, and felt its final blow to regionalisms in the trenches of WW1. Especially Occitania.

Had the world gone different, the southern half of France would be a nation so different from Paris as Italy or any other neighboring country.

And if the central government of Spain had done things right, there would be too a *Madrid et la Champagne*. Had the world gone different, and it wouldn't have been very difficult to be so, maybe Portugal would be part of Spain, and Catalonia, or Aragon, independent. Maybe Spain would encompass all three parts, and only Spanish would be spoken integrally.

What happened? The origins of the Eastern block of Spain were in the Frankish Empire, the Castillians and Portuguese, were the remnants of the Visigothic kingdom before Al-Andalus. The two parts evolved into kingdoms until Castille and Aragon merged *as equals*, and later Felipe II gained Portugal. Had Felipe established the capital in Lisboa the world would be very different, but he was a timid and somewhat reclusive man, intelligent and efficient as he could be. He remained in Castille.

The actions of a few, in this sense, shape the world for centuries, and history is the opposite of inevitable. To claim historical reasons to gain an objective is to legitimize a dice roll.

What did the elite in Madrid for centuries wrong and what differentiated it from Paris? In this sense, the objective of cultural agglutination of both states have been very similar. We could delve in the cultural way of acting of each culture, specially the elites, but imho we're getting too anthropological here.

The thing is the Castille considered lost Portugal to soon, maybe because it had not sufficient influence to seize it, maybe because the roughness of both spanish climate and geography has always resulted in more local or regional singularities, added up to the supposed proud spanish character, which doesn't help things. It did keep Galicia quieted down, at least, but to cost of extreme poverty and marginalization whereas in an alternate universe it could be much more stronger. It did succeed completely in eradicating any remnant of moorish culture.

With Aragon, Castille began its centralization process but did not finish it. And with this cultural evolution, this 'end of history' of the last century, time is up. You did not your homework. Catalonia rebounced. How?

The Asturiano, the Leones, the Aragones, the Navarro, all of them were (are) (nearly) extinct languages that were victims of this centralization process.

But Aragon is so big. And when Aragon I mean Aragon itself+Valencia+Catalonia+Baleares. The line of castillian colonization stopped near the Catalan border, and the half of the Valencian region.

[Relevant Map] (http://www.prolingua.gal/uploads/thumbnail/d4838ccd91c8df989b17eba35d48f75e2e4ac531.PNG)

Why? It began late, very late. Officially. What was the objective of Fernando and Isabel in their marriage in 1478. Castille was more powerful than Aragon, yes, but Aragon itself was on the brink of converting itself into the next superpower of the Christendom. it had lost Naples time ago, but recently it had reseized with extreme facility. Aragon had had a great time in the 13th Century. The following two slowed down it's inevitable expansion with plagues, bad harvests, crisis, and a long unfortunate etc. Plus, France had won the fight over Occitania. And wow Occitania was far away from Paris that time, both culturally and physically. 

Aragon was very decentralized, yes, but now, at the end of the 15th century, it had grasped (with Venice) all the Mediterranian commerce, and now had so much gold, manpower and armies to take over the world, both Christian (with the approval of the Pope) and Muslim, beginning by Italy. And with Castille, they would be unparalleled. All the united kingdom strategy was going to be the orientation to the Mediterranian. Barcelona would be the capital, or Valencia, two cities which in that time were the same as big.

[Onwards!] (http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070623125156/lotr/images/3/34/Aragorn2.jpg)

The discovery of the Americas changed all that. Aragon entered a deep crisis while the Center and Western blocks of the peninsula, now culturally established, flourished with the spices trades and the metal extractions from UltraMar. The strategy shifted west, Aragon was kept marginalized. The elites started Speaking Castillian and would not stop until the 20th century.

The final blow the only theoretical now equal union of Castille and Aragon was dealt in 1714.

In the Spanish succession war I will not extend much as I rely on your history knowledge. But key was the factor of the death of the older brother, Joseph I, of the Austrian throne claimer, Charles VI in the middle of the war, as the Netherlands and GB stopped supporting him as they didn't want again a Spanish-Austrian megabuck.

Charles VI renounced to the Spanish throne and only Aragon kept with the war. (Only Catalonia, as Zaragoza and Valencia had already failed).

[In this interview in Spanish] (http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/09/12/5412a65e268e3ec6088b456f.html) you can have many details and solve misconceptions about the conflict:

The 'Fueros' of the three main parts of Aragon (Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia), that is, the local laws and privileges, were stripped, and from here, the Castillians got in a risky move, that could have gone bad or good. It went bad.

[Centralization to Aragon:] (http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/7243/3216/1600/345397/mapa_espanya_assimilada.jpg)

To equal Castille to Spain, when its not. To say the Francoist slogan: España 'UNA' (one), grande y libre (great and free). Had they accomplished the Catalan integration into Castillian Spain, the success would have been resounding, but it was difficult, and Madrid was not Paris. And during centuries, and still now on, corruption, nepotism and bad moral practices have been higher in Spain than in the rest of Occidental Europe.",geopolitics,climate change

#General Introduction

&nbsp;

The United States of America is the fourth largest country in the world (ranking includes Antarctica), with a land area of 9.1 million square kilometers, and has a proportionally wide range of climates, terrains, and seasonal variations--the continental US ranges from the tropical Florida to the frigid northwest. 45% of this land is agricultural land, with permanent pasture taking up more than half of this and arable land taking up the vast majority of the remainder. Relevant natural hazards experienced include hurricanes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, forest fires in the west, and flooding.

&nbsp;

With its 330 million inhabitants mostly concentrated on the coasts and the eastern inland portion of the country, the country is relatively sparsely populated. The population is projected to increase steadily throughout the remainder of the century, decelerating very slightly during this period, and reaching 390 million by 2050 and 450 million by 2100, representing an 18% and 36% increase compared to 2018, respectively. As the U.S. currently has a fertility rate of 1.8, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, immigration will continue be the biggest driver of this growth. The population pyramid is relatively flat, with very slight bulges around the 15-24 and 45-49 age brackets, and this is projected to continue flattening and lengthening throughout the remainder of the century. Because of this flatness, which reflects its relative youthfulness among developed countries, problems related to population aging seem unlikely. The country is predominantly white (72.4%), with a sizeable black (12.6%) and Asian (4.8%) population. It should be noted that a separate listing for Hispanic has not been included as they have been counted as part of other ethnicities. 

&nbsp;

With a GDP (PPP) of $19.5 trillion, the U.S. has the world's second largest economy, second only to China. It has a high GDP (PPP) per capita of $60,000, ranking 19th, and is the largest country by population among the top hundred countries of this metric. The vast majority of the country's GDP originates from services (80%) and a tiny sliver from agriculture (0.9%), which indicates a very high degree of development.

&nbsp;

Under a high emissions scenario, temperatures are projected to rise signficantly by the late 21st Century, with Alaska and inland regions projected to experience increases of up to 5 degrees Celsius and beyond, while regions closer to the coast are projected to see progressively smaller rises. Precipitation changes are projected to vary significantly according to season and latitude, with the largest changes occuring during spring and winter. During these seasons, the north central region is projected to see up to 20% increases and the Southwest is projected to see a 20% decrease. During other seasons, small changes have been projected, with many areas seeing changes that are indistinguishable from natural variability. The sea level is projected to rise between 1.2 and 1.8 m by 2100 under an intermediate-emissions scenario, with the Gulf of Mexico coast seeing the greatest increase. The resulting increase in tidal flooding and storm surges will have a profound impact on the trillion-dollar coastal property market and public infrastructure, with one economic analysis finding a 66% probability that ""between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of real estate will be below sea level by 2050; and $238 billion to $507 billion, by 2100."" 

&nbsp;

Agricultural production is expected to decline over time due to the increase in temperature and shifting precipitation patterns, as well as increased incidence of pests and diseases, despite the increase brought on by an increased carbon dioxide concentration and a northward shift of land that is optimal. Intensified wildfires and accelerated depletion of water supplies for irrigation are also negative factors. Despite this, the country's dominance in biotechnology and in science and technology in general, when combined with its wealth, means that it is likely to have little trouble adapting. The country as a whole is at very low risk for food security issues as it produces 12,000 - 25,000 Calories per capita per day, though a significant proportion of its population [has been reported](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2011/02/19/opinion/19blowcht.html) to experience food insecurity due to financial issues, which highlights the wealthy country's severe inequality, which is likely to grow due to climate change.

&nbsp;

The per capita renewable internal freshwater resources of the US is 8,844 cubic meters per year, which is significantly higher than the global average of 5,900 cubic meters per year. Despite this, water quality and quantity are expected to be at risk due to ""significant depletion of aquifers in many regions"", but, more alarmingly, because ""much of the critical water and wastewater infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life"" and there has been no comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of this infrastructure to climate change, or of the cost of its reconstruction and recovery. The National Climate Assessment reported that ""Water security in the United States is increasingly in jeopardy"".

While carbon emissions disproportionately originate in wealthy nations, it is the developing world that will bear the most [severe ](https://eos.org/scientific-press/study-global-warming-hits-poorest-nations-hardest)consequences. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing how some countries in the developing world are adapting to climate change.  I will discuss the Cape Town water crisis, the impact of climate change on agriculture in Russia, and Bangladesh's management of cyclones and floods.  


While most climate change models predict increased levels of precipitation, [most ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-climate-models-tell-us-about-future-rainfall)climate change models that by 2050, levels of rainfall in South Africa will decrease by around 25%. Capetown suffered from severe drought between 2015 and 2017, and by mid-2018 people became afraid that Cape Town would reach day zero, the point at which the municipal government would be forced to close the taps and force people to [queue ](https://physicsworld.com/a/cape-town-day-zero-water-crisis-due-to-migrating-moisture-corridor/)for water at public water stations.  The city government was forced to resort to drastic measures, including banning the watering of lawns, creating a water use goal of only 13 [gallons ](http://time.com/cape-town-south-africa-water-crisis/)(one 90 second shower, and four toilet flushes) of water per day  and automatically shut off water to households that used more than 93 gallons and a public relations campaign to not flush toilets after urination. The government was able to reduce water consumption by [50%](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/cape-town-running-out-of-water-drought-taps-shutoff-other-cities/), and solid rainfalls in 2018 ended the crisis. A wide swathe of the world is expected to see substantial drying over the next 50 years, including the Mediterranean region, Central America and the American West, and western Australia, and cities in these regions will have to adapt ""300 year"" droughts happening more and more often.  


While climate change will make South Africa more inhospitable to humanity, the opposite is true in Russia. Climate change is expected to [increase ](https://www.climatechangepost.com/russia/climate-change/)temperatures by around 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next 50 years and levels of precipitation are expected to increase by more than 25%. While higher temperatures and precipitation will allow the extension of agriculture northwards and [allow ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrei_Kirilenko2/publication/226981684_Climate_change_food_stress_and_security_in_Russia/links/09e41511126ddc89b9000000/Climate-change-food-stress-and-security-in-Russia.pdf)for a longer growing season, it is unclear what the impact of climate change will be in the log run. Agriculture in Russia is concentrated  in southern Russia, where highly fertile Chernozerm black soils allow for some of the most productive soils in the world and most climate change models project reduced rainfall and increased [drought ](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00360.1)in this region. Russia in 2017 produced 86 million tons of wheat, making it the [3rd largest](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#rankings/countries_by_commodity) wheat-producer in the world. Russian wheat production increased by 76% over the last ten years, and in 2018 Russia became the largest wheat exporter in the world. Global warming will dramatically [reduce ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/1/014010/pdf)agricultural yields in much of the world. The only way to avoid catastrophic hunger is for countries such as Russia where climate change will improve agricultural potential to increase agricultural production.   


While climate change has created opportunities in some countries, it poses an existential risk to others. Bangladesh has always suffered severe weather events. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people, and Bangladesh has [suffered ](https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/deadlyworld.asp)from seven of the ten deadliest cyclones in world history. Bangladesh suffers from deadly floods every year with one fifth of the country inundated every year. Flooding is [exacerbated ](https://qz.com/india/1432375/climate-change-may-force-200000-people-in-bangladesh-to-migrate/)by increased levels of rainfall and rising sea levels from global warming. Bangladesh has been able to dramatically reduce cyclone mortality thanks to the Cyclone Preparedness Program. The CPP is a volunteer force of [55,000 ](https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/asia-pacific/bangladesh/ifrc-launches-emergency-appeal-to-aid-coastal-communities-in-bangladesh-affected-by-cyclone-roanu/)people that organizes educational campaigns and maintains shelters before cyclones, coordinates evacuation programs during cyclones, and provides first aid and rescue services after cyclones. Between 1991 and 2009 the government doubled the number of public cyclone shelters to 3,976. Bangladesh has suffered three Category 5 cyclones since 1970. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people and Cyclone Gorky in 1991 killed 140,000 people, while Cyclone Sidr in 2007 killed only 3,000 [people](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/cyclone-sidr-bangladesh-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment-disaster-recovery-and). Bangladesh has been similarly proactive in dealing with floods. The government distributes millions of Water Purification Tablets, and Oral Rehydration Solution before floods. The government has subsidized the construction of [tubewells ](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods)to ensure access to clean water during floods,  so as to minimize levels of cholera and other water-borne [illnesses](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods). Thanks to these pro-active actions, Bangladesh did not have a [single ](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/2017/08/30/bangladesh-eliminates-post-flood-disease-deaths/)flood induced diarrhea death despite massive flooding in 2017.   


In today's podcast episode, I have discussed how Capetown, Russia and South Africa have adapted to climate change. I often hear climate change described as an apocalypse that will destroy our ability to survive. The experience of the three countries in this podcast suggests it is possible to adapt to climate change. However, not all places have institutions as adaptive as those of South Africa and Bangladesh, and there are limits to human ingenuity. Unless political leaders in high carbon emitting countries figure out how to curb emissions, we may discover these limits with catastrophic consequences.

#General Introductions

As the region is composed of seven countries (Egypt has been excluded and will appear in the North Africa discussion), essay-like introductions are impractical. Information relevant to the discussion have been compiled and included in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries are listed in order of population size.

#Questions

* Palestine is facing severe water problems that have been exacerbated by Israel's control over water sources to the area. How likely is it that Palestine will be brought to its knees by water stress? What might the end of the conflict look like?

* Turkey is a major land route for Middle Easterners (and some North Africans) looking to migrate into Europe, and is itself a prospective member of the EU. The EU has reached a deal with Turkey to tackle the migrant crisis by securing its borders and hosting migrants. However, there have already been criticisms that migrants are not being handled in a manner that lives up to the ideals of the EU. With climate change very likely to drastically increase refugee flows, it is likely that Turkey will not live up to these ideals. On top of that, there are criticisms about Turkey's political system from the EU. In light of the above, how likely is it that Turkey will successfully become a member of the EU?

* Water is a precious resource in this arid region of the world, and its value is about to increase due to climate change. The region is already volatile and host to a range of conflicts--with climate change likely to widen power gaps, as wealthy countries are better equipped to adapt while poorer countries are less equipped, how likely is it that we will eventually see consolidation of power in the region?

#Questions

* As noted in one thread on Africa, the political grip of governments on their populations are not as strong as one would expect from a country, such that 'country' might be a misnomer. With climate change reducing available resources, how do you see the struggle between governments and local leaders (warlords, chieftains, etc.) playing out? Would the governments gain more leverage over the local leaders, or vice versa?

* One main commonality among almost all countries in the region is their population pyramids and their population growth projections--the pyramids are exceedingly bottom-heavy, indicating very low levels of development, while population growth is projected to be linear. This translates to large amounts of young adults without opportunities when the effects of climate change truly set in, and this seems especially devastating because the countries concerned seem unlikely to be able to adapt effectively. Migration seems to be an answer, but where to?

#General Introductions

As the region is composed of seven countries (excluding India, which was covered in [the previous post](https://reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9h2xqu/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_india/)), essay-like introductions are impractical. Information relevant to the discussion have been compiled and included in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries are listed in order of population size.

#Questions

* A common theme within South Asia is water insecurity, with some countries, like India, already experiencing severe water stress. With the Himalayas being a vital source of water for the region, including for neighboring China, there have been conflicts over the matter, as detailed in [an article by the Encyclopedia Geopolitica](https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/2018/09/11/water-security-the-himalayan-hydro-political-tug-of-war/). Nepal, which is water-rich (and potentially energy-rich), situated between two water-starved nations. What does the future of Nepal look like? Will it be caught in the crossfire? Will it wisely leverage its advantages and turn wealthy? Will the non-nuclear nation be invaded by one or the other? etc.

* Maldives is the poster-child for climate change because the country is extremely vulnerable to sea level rises due to the low elevations of the islands that make up the country. There is a very real possibility that the entirety of Maldives will be submerged, turning it into a real-life Atlantis that will, ironically, live on as a world-class tourist attraction for divers. If that happens, what will become of this country and the people inhabiting it?

* Of all the regions covered so far, things look the most grim in this region. South Asia should generate a lot of refugees, but where would they head towards, if anywhere at all? The Middle East and Central Asia don't look promising, and China doesn't look welcoming. Don't forget the possibility that they can become internal refugees, though that should severely strain existing cities and might be worse for the country concerned.

* There was a recent post on this subreddit linking to a [World Economic Forum article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/we-need-to-do-more-to-understand-how-climate-change-and-conflict-are-linked-heres-why) about how there's worryingly little research on the potential for climate conflict in South Asia and Southeast Asia--this article was published in an extremely timely fashion for this series, as we've just covered Southeast Asia and have just wrapped up South Asia. Aside from the conflict between China and India over the water resources of the Himalayans, what other potential flashpoints are there? Don't forget that Afghanistan is included in this region.

The populace is unhappy and unsatisfied. Economically it's not doing good outside the petrostates and neither it seems socially. Algeria is seeing f protests rom February, Egypt is under a quasi military rule, the gulf monarchies are living off on oil, Iraq is ones again in turmoil, so is Lebanon while Syria and Libya have been torn up. Israel and turkey are the two exceptions to all this. How long can a situation like this last? Should we expect the mena to descend into widespread chaos again after another crisis like a recession followed by a drought and food shortages? I just fail to see how the status quo can be continued for long without a miracle as it seems to only be trying to suppress the populace while failing to solve the problems that plague the region. In such a case we should expect various forms of ideologues to come up and seize the momentum like happened in Syria, who will these be? Liberalism lacks the popular support in the region and especially in the ones I mentioned so should we expect a replay of Sunni islamists trying to takeover alongside various shias and non Arab minorities like the kurds trying to go their own way?

This Thursday from 9 am to 1 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) /r/Geopolitics will be hosting the Atlantic Council's [Peter Engelke](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/peter-engelke) and Stimson's [David Michel](http://www.stimson.org/users/3309) on water grand strategy and water scarcity.

A bit about the scholars that'll be with us:

* Dr. Engelke is a resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Strategic Foresight Initiative, which aims to enhance analysis and policy making through understanding future challenges and opportunities at global scale. From urbanization to intra-State relations to the Atlantic basin, questions about water cuts through all his work. His ability to bring a 10,00 ft view with examples and details means we'll walk away from this AUA with insight we can't get anywhere else.

* Dr. Michel has written widely on transboundary water resources management, maritime policy, the international impacts and implications of global warming, and on the possibilities for collective institutions to address environmental problems. He has advised the National Intelligence Council and the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy and State on environmental security and climate policy issues. The tl;dr is he understands water and the issues surrounding the resource.

Given how crucial water is for survival, the world as we've known it being altered by climate change, and our planet's continuous global population growth, this event will allow us to tackle questions we as a species will be searching to answer for decades to come.

Barnett (I know it's a little outdated), but I found his theories for truely making globalization global (shrinking the non-integrated gap) a really interesting IR read, especially given the seemingly perfected balance between pragmatism and idealism presented in the book.

This really explained to me now how you have Salafi Jihadists and groups like ISIS wanting to establish a caliphate to resist globalization's effects of abolishing cultural identities like that of Islam and communal Africa, and the problems presented with it. While he also presents processes that could likely bring stability through external security/nation-building that would drive FDI/economic growth.

I just wanted opinions on the book, and a general discussion on globalization, so I'll present a few questions to get the ball rolling if anyone wants to participate:

* How fast (or slow) do you think globalization should come to this region, given that there are factors that want to stop the spread and serious cultural ramifications to consider?

* Is a Core-wide coalition (probably G-20 countries ideally, but starting with G-8 nations at first) really possible to deal with issues like transnational terrorism, climate change issues, and humanitarian crises that generally plague the gap and even other parts of the core?

* Can the UNSC, or the general assembly be modified in some ways to allow for greater cooperation in these issues rather than creating a new organizational structure? 

* Should the Leviathan (US led military force that predominates the world's security landscape) allow for more outside cooperation when considering pre-emptive strikes or military incursions into the gap, or just remain the sole force to take out non-state actors and topple dictators? 

* Would a re-balance be needed, or does the SysAdmin (nation-builders/occupiers) ratio (80% external foreign involvement) remain good enough to satisfy those militaries by doing domestic police training, insurgency crackdowns, and military buildup? ",geopolitics,climate change

Basically, it claims that drought during the decade of the 2000s in rural regions of Syria (and perhaps neighboring countries as well) led to large-scale migration of people from increasingly unproductive agricultural hinterlands into Syrian cities like Aleppo and Damascus. The boom in population led to overcrowding and widespread unemployment, especially for the rural farming class who lack appropriate skills for participation in urban economies. Overcrowded slums, poverty, police/military crackdowns, and reductions in civil rights led to urban Syrians participating in Arab Spring-style protest, which obviously escalated into insurgency and finally full-blown civil war. 

So, a few questions: 

1. How accurate are the statements made in the article I linked? I am a firm believer that climate change (drought, water scarcity, inundation of densely-populated coastal regions and ensuing mass emigration) is the number one threat to global security in the next century, just to lay my biases on the table - CMV? 
2. First off I apologize if I am wrong on some of what I say; I am not an expert on the SCW. The rebel combatants (excluding foreign fighters/ISIL), are they mostly native Syrian? I understand most of them hail from rural and impoverished backgrounds, which is a large part of the drought-war argument. Is the FSA mainly composed of these? Are the individuals who participated in the protests in early 2011 mostly from the same group which emigrated from impoverished rural Syria and are now in rebel groups? 
3. Is the Kurdish region of Rojava a fertile lanscape? Were they afflicted by drought in the same way other parts of rural Syria were? Do/did Kurds from Rojava ever emigrate to Aleppo or other parts of Syria in a non-combat context?
4. (most important question) Does anyone have any hard data on the topic? GIS data, particularly regarding movement of people within Syria in the years up to 2011, would be extremely helpful to me.

So far this year there have been [over ](http://latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-28/brazil-planes-chile-fight-amazon-fires)83,000 fires in Brazil, a 77% increase from the same time last year with a majority of the fires in the Amazon region. The upsurge in fire and deforestation could have a dramatic impact on global warming, as the Amazon rain forest acts as one of the most important carbon sinks in the planet. By some estimates, deforestation has resulted in [one billion](http://carbonbrief.org/amazon-rainforest-is-taking-up-a-third-less-carbon-than-a-decade-ago) tons less carbon being sequestrated than a decade earlier, and the current fires will only accelerate this trend. The nightmare scenario for the Amazon is fears that since the Amazon [generates ](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/trees-amazon-make-their-own-rain)much of its own rainfall, massive deforestation may create an almost impossible cycle of reduced rainfall, mass tree die offs, and uncontrollable fires that could [destroy ](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/08/01/the-amazon-is-approaching-an-irreversible-tipping-point)the viability of the Amazon as an ecosystem. The fires are caused primarily by human activity. Deliberate [fires ](https://www.businessinsider.com/fires-in-the-amazon-rainforest-were-started-by-humans-2019-8)are a common strategy for farmers and ranchers to transform rain forest into terrain suitable for pasture or crops, and the regions [drought ](https://www.futurity.org/amazon-rainforest-drought-1976322/)conditions make it easy for a controlled burn to turn into an uncontrollable conflagration.

The recent upsurge is environmental damage to the Amazon is especially disheartening given that Brazil made major progress between 2004 and 2012 to dramatically [reduce ](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-07-03/how-brazil-has-dramatically-reduced-tropical-deforestation/)levels of deforestation and fires. A combination of intensified [enforcement ](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/world/americas/19brazil.html)of environmental laws, pressure from civil society groups, and [voluntary ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837717312413)efforts by soy and beef producers, resulted in deforestation rates falling by more than 70%. At the same time, the global recession and the resulting collapse in [commodity prices](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/soybean.aspx) seriously dented demand for Brazilian soy and beef. Although the relationship [between ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/27/how-beef-demand-is-accelerating-amazons-deforestation-climate-peril/?noredirect=on)beef and deforestation is universally accepted, the relationship between soy and deforestation is [more ](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/4/1341.full.pdf)contested. The overwhelming majority of soy is grown is grown in the [cerrado](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/brazil-deforestation/), a region of grasslands south of the Amazon. However, many argue that increased acreage for soy in the cerrado has [displaced ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024010/pdf)ranchers to the Amazon. Unfortunately we have seen reverses in both commodity prices and government regulations. Brazilian soy and beef exports have [increased ](https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx)by nearly $10 billion since the beginning of Donald Trump's [trade war](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3010480/us-china-trade-war-has-been-boon-brazils-soybean-farmers-can), as Chinese consumers are [turning ](https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx)to Brazilian sources.

Worse, in 2018, Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil. His administration has aggressively promoted the development of the Amazon. [Bolsonaro ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/brazil-logging/)has placed the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of determining protected indigenous lands, and fired [large ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/brazil-logging/)numbers of civil servants in Brazil's environmental agencies. Moreover, Bolsonaro's incendiary language makes it clear that environmental law breakers should expect little more than slaps on the wrist for their actions. International pressure has finally forced Bolsonaro to take steps [against](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/world/americas/brazil-military-amazon-fire.html) the fires, but it is clear his government has only limited interest in doing so. In principle, the entire planet would be made better off if wealthy nations were able to spend the tens of billions necessary to properly incentivize developing countries to protect their environments, but the political will to do so seems lacking. The current explosion of fires is only one environmental crisis related the changing land use patterns. The are currently massive fires in the [Bolivian Amazon](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/americas/bolivia-amazon-fires-intl/index.html), [Siberia](https://www.rferl.org/a/seventy-wildfires-still-active-in-russia-s-siberia/30129017.html) and [Angola](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/fires-burning-angola-congo-amazon-maps-190827012619287.html). Some of the worst environmental damage is currently occurring in Indonesia, where the burning of peat bogs releases [more ](https://mashable.com/2015/10/16/indonesia-peat-fires-carbon-bomb/)carbon than all of Germany. Agriculture and land use change accounts for a [quarter ](https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/08/08/land-is-a-critical-resource_srccl/)of all global carbon emissions according to a recent IPCC report, and tackling this problem is vital to avoiding catastrophic climate change.

###Questions and Comments

>""Since it's an Ask Us *Anything* are all questions fair game? 

We want to clarify how this AUA will be moderated and establish expectations beforehand. All questions relating to the future of climate change governance are on the table. Questions that are not will be removed. 

Furthermore should anyone wish to use this event to grind an axe or troll our community, this is your first and last warning. 

>*A message to new users*

Welcome! :-)

Speaking personally, I hope you're enjoying what this (relatively) little community has to offer. To make explicit the values we as a community espouse; a commitment to civil, dispassionate discussion and thoughtful, insightful analysis on all things Geopolitics. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then we're glad to have you on-board! Whether you've been apart of the community for years now or simply for a couple hours, we're glad to have the chance to build a community of like-mannered individuals.

As moderators we will do our darnedest to keep what makes this place special intact. But as a community we each have to make a similar effort, because the character of a community is but the sum of its (active) members. So lets continue to work together and fight the good fight upholding the standards of our sub. Your efforts have helped make this place what it is!

1) A country with a history of an aggressive foreign policy and numerous wars elects an internationally popular moderate president or PM.

2) Shortly after the government's election, a grassroots wave of opposition officials begin altering voting laws (redrawing district borders in an FPTP system and local thresholds in a proportional system, for instance, along with changing voting locations and registration requirements, adding identification/registration fees that hadn't existed previously, and even [deleting registrations for thousands upon thousands of voters.](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/08/22/20079/america-scrubs-millions-voter-rolls-it-fair)). These gradually and significantly weaken the government parties. There's evidence submitted and verified by courts that at least some of these officials targeted ethnic groups that supported government parties.

3) After one or two national election cycles, the opposition is led by a controversial populist with a history of legally questionable activities. He or she is surrounded by shadowy characters with ties to foreign governments and [frequently makes statements implying that ethnic minorities are trying to steal the election.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/11/donald-trump-warns-that-other-communities-are-poised-to-steal-the-election/) This candidate frequently dabbles in conspiracy theories and his or her son [at least once appears on a racially supremacist radio show.](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/03/listen-donald-trump-jr-and-pro-confederate-whit/208993) Externally, this opposition candidate calls for a harsh line on foreign policy, including bombing foreign citizens in their own countries because of the crimes of their relatives, calls for stiff tariffs, implications that international climate action is a ""hoax"" to ""keep us poor"", calls for banning an entire religious group from visiting or setting foot on their soil, and regularly making politically incorrect if not racist remarks about other countries ([for instance implying that Japanese would rather 'watch Sony TV' than engage in foreign policy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/donald-trump-savages-japan-saying-all-they-will-do-is-watch-sony/)).

4) The leading opposition candidate calls on live television for the president/PM to be hacked by a foreign power. In the weeks leading up to the election, there is increasing evidence that individuals close to that candidate have had ties to officials within that foreign power. 

5) The head of the country's national law enforcement agency, who is reported to be an opposition sympathizer, releases a cryptic letter implying that new damning evidence has been found tying the government candidate to criminal activity. He later clarifies the matter.

6) After the opposition leader calls for their opponent to be hacked, a series of emails are leaked from the governing parties showing them engaging in lawful but unethical conduct.

7) The election reveals that, in spite of a significant majority of voters voting against the opposition, that the erstwhile opposition has complete control of the national government and of the vast majority of state and local governments. 

8) The weeks following the inauguration of the new government see dozens of bombing raids on other countries as well as the passage of policies shredding the country's involvement in the Paris climate treaty, among others. The new government begins sending ""invoices"" demanding money from trading partners and military allies.

This seems as though it will become increasingly prevalent as urbanization occurs in the Global South and East Asia.

The congregating of people into dense population centers as the result of rapid urbanization in places such as Africa, and the subsequent amount of growing international trade between countries on the continent, and the rest of the world, means that diseases that had initially been restricted to the interior of impoverished, tropical areas, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, are now able to spread out at an alarming rate.

It appears that development and urbanization in Africa, South America, and South-Southeast Asia is inevitable (and it's unlikely to find anyone who would argue that lifting the lives of billions of people in these areas out of poverty is a bad thing). While this is, from my opinion, undoubtedly a good thing, the consequences of this urbanization on the spread of pathogens and contagions, and the potential for a global health crises unrestricted by political borders, means that the unwillingness for countries to cooperate on containment strategies could lead to serious consequences.

I guess the question I would like to pose it this: Should the increasing trade and development that occurs in high-risks result in an ever-increasing amount of pathological threats to the entire world, would the necessity of cooperation result in a significant alteration of the current geopolitical paradigm for many nations? There are obviously already interactions between health agencies, including the WHO, the CDC, etc., but if the threat became a greater possibility, would we greater cooperation among nations, a half-assed attempt to balance national interests over international concerns (such as what is being seeing with initiatives for climate change), or would we see an increasing level of isolation, suspicion, and an ""every-nation-for-himself"" mentality among leadership?

Secondly, while previously, geographical isolation in the form of being an island state, or surrounded by mountains, would have helped shape certain nations policies towards contagion, would the speed and rate at which an infection could spread alter the decisions of nation-states beyond what geopolitical theories would suggest?

Of course people would be wondering why a person like Scaramucci would have anything to say about Syria, but I think his piece is interesting because of the following reasons 1) Unlike most defenders of Trump's policies he attack the foreign policy establishment / elites 2) Mentions the delicate balance faced by both Trump and Obama ,  disengaging from the Middle East while ensuring the stability of the region 3) Provides a global perspective.  its not best article out there, but it covers the key factors. After summarizing the article I will answer some questions 4 questions based on the articles I read about the Syrian withdrawal

1. WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?
2. WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?
3. WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?
4. WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

The problem with people when they look at Trump's foreign policy, they don't develop a framework or angle of attack, people get obsessed with his antics. In this post I am not so concerned about accuracy, but the framework. However, before beginning with the summary, I will provide two articles, one from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/trump-syria-withdrawal-us-troops) and the other [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/blog/trump-right-withdraw-syria), arguing about dubious legality of US intervention in Syria from an international law standpoint, but also that it wasn't authorized by Congress.  The problem with these article is they don't really provide a balanced geopolitical assessment why Trump made the decision he made.

# SUMMARY

Scaramucci starts off by referring to  Fred Greenstein book Th*e Hidden-Hand Presidency* that things are not exactly as they appear. The book was about the Presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, The Greenstein argues that beneath Eisenhower's placid exterior there was great political activity.

**OPINION:** I would argue that with Trump that despite the chaos. Trump has a worldview and Trump's foreign policy objective aren't too different from Obama's, only the tactics and methods used may vary, For the commentators about the withdrawal from Syria they might consider this in the realm of strategy in the Middle East, but to the US President in global scheme of US foreign policy it is just a tactic.

Scaramucci makes four points about US policy in the Middle East

1. Problems in the Middle East are intractable. The US has spent US $6 Trillion and 7000 Americans had died in Iraq and Afghanistan over a course of 17 years. Drain on American resources that could be better spent at home on infrastructure and education
2. Completer disengagement is not an option for the US, but the US can't be everywhere.  This is a dilemma faced by both Trump and Obama, and both have tried to find the balance.  While Scaramucci says that a number of troops are need to maintain stability he says  **However, largescale occupation without a clear exit strategy is a fool’s  errand. Since World War II we have shouldered the great burden of  securing peace and prosperity for the free world, but more than seventy  years later, if we do not receive more proportional help from our allies  this magnanimous approach will become unsustainable.**
3. He wonders if the the policies and interventions in the Middle East would be different if there was conscription or a draft.  Scaramucci mentions Eisenhower's speech about the Industrial Military complex.
4. As the US is bogged down in the Middle East, China is ramping up its foreign intervention, building artificial islands in the SCS and expanding its influence through the BRI.   **Hopefully China and the United States avoid falling into Thucydides  Trap, but if military confrontation does materialize, will we be  economically and strategically prepared for it? Trump is the first  American leader to confront China on trade. In the same vein, his policy  of engagement with Russia and North Korea is part of a strategy to  develop additional security in the region.**

Last, Scaramucci pleads   **As our democratically elected leader, he  deserves room to execute his alternative approach to foreign policy.**   

**OPINION:**  As Scaramucci has said about the Obama and Trump dilemma in the Middle East can be applied to their foreign policy.  There is more similarities between Obama and Trump's foreign policy than that of Obama and Clinton for example.[Both Obama and Trump felt that US traditional Western and East Asian allies weren't pulling their weight when it came to security](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-security-commentary-idUSKCN0Z72OW).  The difference was the tone, with Trump being much more vocal.  Outside engagements in the Middle East, since the Cold War., the amount the US spends on defense isn't a lot as a % of GDP, but that is only part of the argument. Even the Baltic states spend about 1% of their GDP and they are the most vulnerable.  Granted the US gains benefits from this arrangement, but its reasonable to ask the US allies to spend more. [Germany is so obsessed about budget surpluses, that its under funding its rail system, I can't imagine what the Bundeswehr looks like](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/why-german-trains-dont-run-on-time-any-more).

Both Trump and Obama wanted to pull out troops from the Middle East, and they were lambasted by the establishment for doing so. This is what Trump had to say about the Middle East

>[It’s very  important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we’re going to stay in  that part of the world. Now, are we going to stay in that part of the  world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a  reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/trump-israel-one-reason-for-u-s-troops-to-remain-in-middle-east-1.6697591)

. And for both Obama and Trump it was a key campaign promise. Obama has faced criticism for his pull out of prematurely pullout of Iraq in 2011, but Obama didn't anticipate the instability caused by the Arab Spring in late 2011. Moreover, much of the instability in the Middle East was caused by the Iraq invasion of 2003.  Right now, Trump is facing the similar criticism  regarding the pullout from Syria.

Both Trump and Obama have been accused of abandoning and alienating allies The right accused Obama of alienating [Saudi Arabia](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/barack-obama-has-nobody-to-blame-but-himself-for-alienating-saud/), Turkey, [Europe](https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/opinions/obama-europe-tisdall/index.html) and [Israel](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/12/obama-israel-kerry-allies/511796/), and appeasing Iran. Trump has been accused of alienating close allies like Canada, Japan and the Europeans.  One must understand, the system of alliance is a tool for the US, it isn't end in itself for maintaining US security and interest.  The US can afford to push around its core circle of allies, because frankly they aren't going anywhere.  It will take a lot for the likes of Canada to switch over to China/Russia, and so far outside of snubs and insults by both Obama and Trump, the US hasn't done a lot to disturb these relationship.  Trump has signed new trade agreement with [Canada and Mexico, as well as South Korea, which aren't much different from the previous agreements](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-nafta-gets-a-new-name-but-little-else-has-changed/).  This also applies to dependencies like Saudi Arabia and Israel. People were complaining how Obama ""mistreated"" Saudi Arabia and Israel, but the reality is who else are they going to turn too?  Trump's approach to authoritarian allies is different from Obama's, but I think in the grand scheme of things its more tactical.  US allies are like dogs, some are thoroughly domesticated, some semi-domesticated, some feral.  The ones you have to be careful are the semi-domesticated ones, a good example would be non-Western democracies and hybrid regimes like Philippines, Thailand and Turkey, Trump's decision to pull out of Syria benefited Turkey the most. And for a geopolitical viewpoint, which I will talk about in more depth later on, Turkey position in the Middle East in the long run is the strongest.    Disagreement with the West largely was centered around support of Syrian Kurds. The Kurds already have Iraqi Kurdistan, so its not a question of building a homeland for the Kurds. Furthermore, a Iraqi Kurdistan is faced with political divisions and flagging economy, despite the control of oil fields. How would a Syria Kurdistan look like ?  [Rex Tillerson tried to smooth things over with Turkey](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rex-tillerson-offers-olive-branch-after-turkey-warns-alliance-could-break-completely). The decision to abandon the Syrian Kurds and shift backing to Turkey was almost a year in the making.  Since the capture of Raqaa in October 2017, Trump has been asking about a withdrawal.

Both Obama and Trump objective is pivot to Asia to counter China, or go back to US strategic objectives prior to 9/11. Obama's Asia pivot which was announced in 2011 was weak because it was distracted by [Arab Spring in late 2011, and than Russian annexation of Crimea.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/asia-pivot-obamas-ticket-out-of-middle-east/)  The difference between Obama and Trump, is Trump is more single minded about China.  Most of the post here talked about the Syrian/Afghanistan troops withdrawals in isolation, without referring to [Xi Jinping's speech about commemorating 40 years of reform](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/181218022820736.html), charges against [two Chinese hackers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/20/tech/chinese-hacker-charges/index.html) and the rebuke of  state sponsored [Chinese commercial espionage by the US and her Western allies.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-21/australia-joins-condemnation-of-chinese-espionage/10645414) [In 2015, Xi and Obama had reached an agreement that there would be no state sponsored commercial spying, while the Chinese has reduced their activity in 2015 and 2016, once Trump came to office it wet back to normal.](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/us-china-reach-historic-agreement-economic-espionage/)  From a regional Middle Eastern lens, Trump's withdrawal in Syria and Afghanistan seems hasty and on the fly. This is where I differ from Scaramucci. If one looks at it from a global perspective, its not. Trump's is basically telling China ""You are our number one strategic concern""

# QUESTIONS

**WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?**

* ISIS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, AND AS TRUMP SAID THE SYRIANS, TURKEY, IRAN AND RUSSIA CAN FINISH THEM OFF. THERE WILL BE NO VACUUM
* THE NARROW AIM OF DEFEATING ISIS HAD BEEN EXPANDING TO A PROXY WAR AGAINST IRAN AND RUSSIA, AIM OF SECURING PEACE WITH ASSAD, PROTECTING ISRAEL AND THE KURDS (MISSION CREEP)
* THE 2200 US TROOPS IN SYRIA MOSTLY USED FOR TRAINING. NOT ENOUGH TO FULLFIL FURTHER OBJECTIVES.
* IN 2011, THE US KNEW LITTLE ABOUT NE SYRIA. HAD NOT NATIONAL INTEREST

**WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?**

* ISIS MIGHT REGROUP AGAIN. *UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT RUSSIA, TURKEY, IRAN AND SYRIA WON'T ALLOW THEM*
* HANDS A VICTORY TO ASSAD AND PUTIN. *THE OBJECTIVE WASN'T OVERTHROWING ASSAD BUT DEFEATING ISIS.  ASSAD AND PUTIN HAVE SUPPOSEDLY WON. BUT ALL PUTIN AND ASSAD HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE A WEAKER POSITION THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE WAR.  IRAN IS MORE ENTRENCHED IN SYRIA, AND TURKEY WILL EVENT UALLY CONTROL MUCH OF NORTHERN SYRIA.*
* ABANDONING ALLIES -- *THE KURDS IN SYRIA. THE KURDS IN SYRIA WERE ALWAYS IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION.

**WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?**

Peter Zeihan, who wrote the book Accidental Superpower, is a controversial figure in geopolitics, talks about the end game in Syria / Middle East as being a US withdrawal from the Middle East. The question is what should the end state in Middle East look like? Should it be a local hegemon ensuring it remains stable and static, or should it be a balance of power, where all sides balance each other out.. Peter Zeihan isn't an expert on the Middle East, but he does raises interesting question. Obama opted for balance of power as Zeihan elaborates

>That left option two: establish a regional balance of power so the  region would self-regulate. This balance, ultimately, is what the  nuclear deal sought to achieve: partially rehabilitate Iran, partially  reintroduce it into the international system so that Iran could  counter — and be countered by — the other regional players. In doing  so — or so the theory goes — the region’s wars will be many, but  limited.The key selling point of the balance-of-power option  was that the Middle East has so many competing centers of power that no  single country would ever be able to gain a significant, long-term  advantage. That would keep any of the (many) expected battles bottled up  within the region. It sounds a bit cruel, but the ongoing civil wars in  Syria and Yemen are good examples of the balance-of-power strategy *working* because those conflicts keep the region’s powers at one another’s throats.

At the time of the writing, Trump had scarped the nuclear deal with Iran, and had no replacement.

>Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal does two things. First, it  wrecks the balance-of-power strategy by gutting the possibilities of the  region’s most active player: Iran. The resurrection of global financial  sanctions on Iran will — at a minimum — halve the country’s export  earnings by year’s end. This means the Americans will need a new  strategy for the region. At present, the Trump administration hasn’t  offered anything as to what that might be. But that is an issue for  another day.

At least with regards to Syria, I think a static equilibrium is emerging. The Russians have pulled outo f Northern Syria, and the Syrian government have told the Kurds

>[According to political sources in  Damascus, the Syrian Army will not come to the aid of the Kurdish  warriors but also will not join the Turks in their extermination. Rather,  they will stand by and watch, waiting to see who collapses first, the  Kurds or Erdogan. The policy resembles that of the Reagan  Administration, which stood by and watched the Iran-Iraq War of  1980-1988, hoping that it would either rid them of Khomeini or Saddam  Hussein.](http://www.atimes.com/article/damascus-to-stand-by-as-kurds-face-turkish-onslaught/)

Is Turkey going to be the local hegemon that he is referring too. Zeihan himself dismisses Turkey, while he argues Turkey does have the capability and unlike Iran or Russia, can pour troops into Syria to become the hegemon.  [Zeihan correctly raises the question whether the Turks want the ""crown"", given Trukey's continued interest in joining the EU](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-eu-full-membership-european-union-commitment-president-a8274166.html).  For Turkey the occupation of North Syrian is more to drive out the Kurdish militant groups and establish a buffer.  He also questions whether or not any local hegemon will have US interest at heart. [It appears that Trump has bought into Erdogan promise to wipe out ISIS](https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/turkey-biggest-winner-of-us-syria-withdrawal-1.61074777).

WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

MAN OF HIS WORD

First, **Trump is a man of his word** . While his actions are erratic, but what is consistent is his desire to keep his [big campaign promises.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/09/trump-iran-deal-lowry-218355) This is important with regards to foreign policy, because a US President faces far less constraints on foreign policy as he does on domestic policy.  It is like he has mental to do list seared into his brain.  Trump is relentless until the item is completed and done.

>[The list is long and growing. He pulled the United States out of the  Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate pact and the Iran nuclear  deal. He will move permanently the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He  has slashed the US company tax rates and stacked the judiciary with  qualified conservatives. He has put a “travel ban” that restricted entry  to America from several Muslim nations, which the Supreme Court upheld  this week. On July 16, Trump will broker detente with Vladimir Putin in  Helsinki.](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/like-it-or-not-trump-is-a-man-of-his-word-20180629-p4zoib.html)

Trump said he was going to draw down troops from the Middle East and Central Asia, and this is him keeping those promises.     I am going to provide you a list of [Trump's foreign policy promises](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) drawn [various sources.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) To be honest a lot of Trump's campaign promises aren't really original, previous mainstream candidates have made such promises before, but it was expected that people won't go through with it.  The difference with Trump, is that he does.

* Cancel global warming payments to the United Nations
* Renegotiate / Cancel the Iran deal
* Build a safe zone for Syrian refugees
* Move Embassy in Israel
* Close parts of the Internet where ISIS is
* Bring back waterboarding
* Develop a plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days
* Establish a commission on radical Islam
* Reverse Barack Obama's Cuba policy
* Cancel the Paris climate agreement
* Call for an international conference to defeat ISIS
* Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization
* Ask countries we protect to pay more for joint defense
* Suspend immigration from terror-prone places
* Stop TPP
* Renegotiate NAFTA
* Raise tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.
* Cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take undocumented immigrants back
* Build A Wall and have Mexico pay for it.
* Improve Relations with Moscow
* Defeating ISIS and Pulling out of Middle East
* Increase Defense Spending

When you break Trump campaign promises into a list, a lot of his promises are very minor and mundane, nothing particularly ambitious or earth shattering.  Secondly, he has fulfilled most of his campaign promises with regards to foreign policy that doesn't require Congressional approval. Thirdly, in a democracy, the major promises made during the campaign is the contract between voters and the candidate. If a candidate promises to build 5 bridges during the campaign, and later on when he is in office promises to build 10 because more money has been free up. If he ends up building 7 bridges, he hasn't broken his promise. Trump isn't a person who will go beyond his contract

# TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY AND THE COLD WAR

[This last section is more speculative, even though I will provide sources. To under Trump's foreign policy, you have to understand the last two decades of the Cold War It was in the 1980s, that Trump moved from being a New York celebrity to a national one.](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/400185-trumps-foreign-policy-rooted-in-nixon-reagan-principles)

What Trump is doing with the withdrawals from the Mideast, his failed attempted to appease the Russians, to gain leverage against China, in the way the Nixon/Carter/Reagan did with the Soviets by normalizing relations with China in the 1970s.  Even as the US was normalizing relations with China, China was still supporting insurgencies in Asia and North Vietnam. The chaos and human tragedy that had befallen on Indochina after fall of South Vietnam is many magnitudes greater than the chaos brought about by the Arab Spring and ISIS. From a strategic perspective by 1979, for both China and the US, it was horrible decisions, Vietnam had switched to the Soviets and had occupied Cambodia.  Obama and Trump are responsible adults compared to Nixon and Kissinger

To some historians the Cold War was just a continuation of the Second World War. The main areas of conflict were still Europe and Pacific, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Western Europe and East Asia are the only regions with the population, industrial capability and proximity to threaten the US. If India's position was reversed with China, India wouldn't be as threatening to the US, because of its location. It could have to fight through China, Southeast Asia, Japan and cross the Pacific  to get to the US. US overall strategy during the Cold War, particularly in Asia, was defensive, because it was the status quo power.

Trump would like to take the world back to the 1980s, before NAFTA (1994), EU (1993) and WTO (1995).  Trump like most conservatives don't have a problem with multilateral organizations, but ultimately believes that disputes should be settled diplomatically rather than through independent judicial bodies. That is the fundamental difference between the NAFTA and the Canadian-US Free Trade Agreement it replaced as well as the WTO and GATT. [Its why the US has been holding up  new appointments to the Appellate Body](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-trade-barbs-at-wto-amid-calls-for-reform/4703772.html)

This notion has been spawned out of changes in technology, environment, polities' recurring interaction with one another because of liberal markets and doing away with mercantile policies, a landscape of 4G warfare (all about covert operations through insurgencies and weakening your enemies' morale) into the non-integrated portions of our global map, etc. 

* Globalization started taking its course as early as humans began moving out of Africa into centers around Mesopotamia, the Indus River Valley, and the Yellow rivers. Are we simply backtracking and trying to get these last few pieces of territory (Mid-East and Africa) into the global fold, or is it more complex than that as we see revisionist policies by countries like Russia?

* What is the role of the state in this future of uncertainty? Can it be corroded as free-flowing information in finances, culture, human communication, capital, and ideas are given relatively easy access to be shared? 

* My answer: I do believe that the state will uphold duties as some societies are very homogeneous by nature and the pressures of globalization won't exceed the state. Now, in more heterogeneous societies like here in the US, that's a tougher question. In the US different cultures and acceptance of an international communities has been part of our soft power attraction for many centuries, and I think our acceptance will actually make it a stronger state given that societal standards aren't plummeted for minorities. I think a possible absorption with Canada is actually a possibility to watch out for within the next 30 years, especially if climate change continues.

* I know the ultimate question that is one everyone's mind when it comes to Globalization eroding **entire** sovereignty is merely fanatical speculation at this point, but any takes on that?

* My answer: I don't think societies will become heterogeneous enough in the near future that world governance can be established, but multilateral institutions certainly help promote cooperation instead of competition. The problems we are going to be facing in the 21st century will be crucial on the development of coherent, comprehensive, and competent institutions if we are going to tackle global issues. Besides, multilateral institutions gives each country not only a chance to cooperate and collaborate, but also to make concerns apparent where there can be some compromise and respect to individual choices. 

* Does a new international institution need to be established as globalization has shifted eastwards towards Eurasia? What scenarios would need to occur in order for that institution to take place?

* Answer: The UN is becoming obsolete as a more multipolar world revolves around countries development in BRICS, Seam-States like Turkey, Indonesia, or Mexico, and multilateral organizations that are economical and political (at this point) like ASEAN. Western societies still hold a lot of pull on rule sets and international affairs, but new powers need to be given some responsibilities in world governance.  States may be reluctant to give up power that have a foothold in the UNSC, but I think if it is gradually recognized (especially with increasingly liberalized markets) sooner than later that growing countries need to be indoctrinated into policy making, a smooth path with some minor rough edges can be laid out in areas of defense, trade laws, global finance, and enforcement of the idealized ""global commons"".",geopolitics,climate change

It's worth noting that there is a clear hierarchy, US > China > Russia, but each power has its own advantages and drawbacks that need to be taken into consideration. 


While prospects for such a rapprochement may seem dim, my attention is drawn to global issues like climate change, resource wars, mass migration, nuclear proliferation, economic tension, and others which do not seem solvable given the current state of antagonistic relations between nation states. 


Obviously, offensive realists seek to maximize the relative power of their state over others, so they would not be into the idea of giving up sovereignty in order to enact better global governance. Defensive realists may be persuaded, since if the priority is preserving the nation, it may only be possible to achieve if there is some sort of grand bargain among the great powers. 


Am I right in thinking that one major obstacle is American exceptionalism? It seems to me that the US is in the position of being the most powerful country and is seeking to prevent the rise of any more powerful country or coalition. It is conceivable that US policy could change in this matter, and what effect would that have on relations with Russia or China? 


Beyond the question of the US changing policy, there's the question of the soundness of the policy. Even if the US is the most powerful country, it isn't an overwhelmingly dominant force on world affairs. The US does not get it's way all the time, or even most of the time. It simply has the most entrenched and powerful economy, political system, and military. Even if the US has 25% of GDP and its alliance makes up the majority of defense spending, we have seen that smaller amounts of resources applied in asymmetric ways can have power destabilizing impacts on the efforts of more traditional militaries. Therefore the US position is not one necessarily of long-term security, since it can't guarantee its safety against all other nations and it has a target on its back because it's attempting to secure the status quo, its preeminence.  


Meanwhile, China and the US are tied together economically and Russia is in desperate need to reconnect with the global community. Is there any chance at all that these powers can settle their differences and meaningfully combat worrying trends like climate change, civil wars, religious and ethnic extremism, etc.? 


Post-question if you think no:


If not, what are the prospects for dealing global crises outside of national leadership or an international alliance? Is there the potential for a global polity to arise as a result of the collective impact of climate change and war on all inhabitants of the earth? Can communications advancements be leveraged in order to challenge the sovereignty of stubborn states? Or is there no structuring principle able to ground such a political endeavor? And if that's the case, what hope is there for the future of the species?

In it I pointed to decades of stagnant living standards for the lower classes/mass migration creating demographic changes/rising inequality as being the primary reasons that after the 2008 economic and 2015 migration crisis finally exploded into the forefront and brought the previously radicals into the mainstream, especially the radical right after 2015. 

I would also say that currently the populist label is being attached very liberally on different people that are very different and at times in close analysis turn out to not be really much ""populist"" if we use the traditional definition of it. From Trump, Salvini,Le Pen to Bolsonaro, Erdogan to Modi and Duterte it has been used without much of any explanation rendering it sort of into a buzzword. In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b6r00j/comment/ejssad6) comment I tried to give a very brief overview into the reasons for the current upsurge of illiberal politicians across the world.

As per the title, in this thread I would like to take another look at and contemplate as to what might happen if the liberal establishment completely collapses in the West after the next recession (feared by many to be near). A few points I would like to make:


- Many of the rising ""nationalists"" in the West can be rather called ""civilizationalists"", in the sense that they are not really interested in upholding only the nation but the entire Western or European civilization. Even many of the actually nationalistic politicians that are rising are also seemingly in favor of such civilizational Union or alliance between European Nations (including those in the new world).

- The above framework provides a plausible scenario for a rapprochement between the West and Russia. In this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/at7x9r/comment/eh0x3ym) I pointed at the prospects of how the future balance of power will likely be and why a rapprochement with Russia is important for the Western alliance due to it's own relative decline. The foremost obstacle to a rapprochement between them is the liberal establishment in the West and it's ideological outlook, but if it indeed collapses fully in the time to come leaving the aforementioned civilizationalists in power that alongside the changing balance of power can certainly see a rapprochement happen.

- The rise of visibly different minorities as a share of the population and the decline of the native majority in many Western countries is also seemingly creating a potential for ethnic conflicts there. If we look at history for empirical purposes then we can see that different groups of people tend to clash unless United against some external force. The fears of the majority, tainting of the minorities (especially Muslims) after large scale sexual crimes (cologne/the grooming gangs in Britain)/terrorist attacks (Berlin/Paris/nice/Brussels/London)/generally higher rate of crimes among them/in many cases being economically a drain and the plummeting of trust in the established liberal ruling class creates a fertile ground for radicals giving solutions to the problems related to minorities. Indeed it seems that many moderates are seemingly realizing the situation and issuing warning, from Hillary Clinton telling the EU to get a handle on migration last year to this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/) by David Frum to Francis Fukuyama arguing against ""identity politics"". The increasing polarization and radicalization of both sides and collapse of the center however will likely not see anyone from the established center providing solutions in the time to come. From what I assess the current situation is one where a large part of the majority is against migration and segments of it are becoming more and more radical, a larger portion is currently undecided and still backs the establishment due to inertia and distrust of the new parties and a small one vehemently in support of migration. I would also like to point to this [article](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/03/06/ignoring-immigration-is-empowering-the-far-right/) for some assessments on this matter.

- I would also like to quote from a previous comment of mine here as to what I think is at the root of the clash between liberalism and tribalism in the West currently:

> The last point I would like to make regarding what you identified as the clash between liberalism and nationalism that led to the 
> (currently increasing) weakening of liberalism in the West itself (it's Homeland) can also be to an extent ascribed to the 
> decoupling of liberalism and nationalism. In the 19th and much of the 20th century Western (American/British/French) liberalism and the established elite were not only liberals but liberal

> evidence of humans being inherently tribal and going from that I would say the currently happening political changes in the West  
> is really tribalism, be it nationalism or civilizationalism 
> rising back towards power and overwhelming a more idealistic 
> system.


Now onto what I think are likely to happen down the line:

- If the predicted recession comes this or the next year, that certainly will fuel polarization and radicalization on both sides of the North Atlantic.

- In North America and especially the United States I do think there is some serious potential for things to get worse quickly in the coming years. Significant portions of the radical right would prefer a second civil war or partition of the country that unlike in the 1960s this time is more ""logical"" and thus likely, the reason for that I would say is the declining portion of the ""white"" majority and especially them being already a minority in the most young generations with the forecast of fully slipping into minority status in the coming time that makes it immensely more easy to convince people the need to split the country or go all in now to keep dominance compared to in the 1960s.

- I think the liberal establishment currently is nearing collapse and another recession and/or migration crisis will likely see it fully collapse followed by the assumption of power by the rising radical right. Another sort of ""Arab spring"" can be seen happening in Algeria currently, and if Algeria takes a turn for the worse and goes the way of Syria or Libya unleashing large migration waves towards Europe while breaking down another dam between sub Saharan Africa and Europe then that will immensely help the radical or otherwise ""populist"" right into coming to power. The next decade I think will very likely see who prevails. The changing of the climate is only going to worsen the migration crisis from Africa and the middle East towards Europe as well as from Latin America towards North America that will help the radical right more than any other part of the political spectrum.

- If the less autocratic or more-or-less Democratic parts of this ""new"" right comes to power and fully becomes the establishment then I think Western societies will develop towards something like current Israel - largely socially liberal but ethnocentric with the conservatives having stronger cultural influence compared to now, the left discredited and marginalized and being seen as a ""suicidal impulse"".

- Relations with China and the Muslim world will likely worsen but can deepen with India. This I think is likely to happen because China and the Islamic world poses the kind of ""direct threat"" to the West that India does not while India itself is adversarial to China alongside Pakistan (a Muslim power) and public being receptive to becoming anti Islamic. Geographically also China and the core of the Muslim would (middle East, especially the Arab countries to Pakistan) stand between India and Europe, neither Europe and the West at Large (including Russia) nor India pose a direct threat to each other geographically while the same cannot be said about the relations with China and the Islamic countries in this regard. This can be compared to the situation between the entente and the central powers before the first world war with Europe and India in place of France and Russia and China and the Islamic world in place of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

This combination of drought and cyclone is likely to become more and more common as climate change intensifies.

Interloper here; I just happened to notice this subreddit while browsing the various subreddits. I noticed the description:

> Specifically, geopolitics is focused on the relationship between politics and territory. Through geopolitics we attempt to analyze and predict the actions and decisions of nations, or other forms of political power, by means of their geographical characteristics and location in the world.
> In a broader sense, geopolitics studies the general relations between countries on a global scale. Here we analyse local events in terms of the bigger, global picture.

It seems to me that geopolitics is about more than politics and territory. For example, isn't migration is a geopolitical issue? Access to resources (fish, oil) which are not part of sovereign territory, including such things as deciding on the extent of exclusive economic zones, and access to resources which are not part of exclusive economic zones? Access to natural resources which Freedom of navigation by air or sea? Transnational pollution--Chernobyl fallout, [Indonesia's forest fires](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X0100122X)? Climate change? Space debris (a form of transnational pollution), such as the immense amount of carnage following [China's 2007 anti-satellite missile test](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-anti-satellite-test) ('Any one of the three hundred satellites—representing some $100 billion—that lie in the Chinese debris cloud “could become road kill”')?

In other words, it seems to me that geopolitics is about much more than politics and territory. Even in a theoretical world of static borders, where no state seeks to acquire additional territory or affect the politics of other states, there are geopolitical concerns.

(2016.05.02, summarized)

Trump said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including
Saudi Arabia.

Trump has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries
that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us
at home.

He believes we can default on our debts to the rest of the world,
which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we
experienced in 2008.

He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.

He praises dictators like Putin and picks fights with our friends.

Including the British PM, the mayor of London, the German chancellor,
the president of Mexico and the Pope.

No other country comes close to matching our military, our capabilities.

I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen,
brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the
reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia and twisted arms to bring the
world together in global sanctions against Iran. And I have, I have
sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the
toughest choices he faced.

If America doesn’t lead, we leave a vacuum. That will either cause
chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they’ll
be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety. The choices they make will not be to our benefit.

Our armed forces fight terrorists together with our allies. Allies
provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to
events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence
that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.

North Korea is perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run
by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that
could carry a nuclear weapon to America.

When I was
Secretary-of-State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South
Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile
defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead,
should it launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it
are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it.
And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to
test it.

Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the
world, because they have nothing to match them.

Trump talks about leaving NATO. He says he’ll stay neutral on Israel’s security.

Trump suggests that America should withdraw our military support for
Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons. He said this about a war
between Japan and North Korea. “If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy
yourself, folks.” I wonder if he even realizes he’s talking about
nuclear war.

Our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point
long before Trump came onto the scene. A number of them have increased
their defense spending.

We need to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten
us at home.

When Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. 

Some
called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war
that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.
President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the
effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the
table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that
should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Now we must
enforce that deal vigorously. 

The world must understand that America
will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to
stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

In particular, Israel’s security is non-negotiable. They’re our
closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend
them.

We are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we
accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb
or putting a single American soldier in harm’s way. Trump says we
shouldn’t have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that
would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their
nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling
the world, good luck, you deal with Iran? Of course Trump doesn’t have
answers to those questions.

Countries like Russia and China often work against us.
Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers.

Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on
NATO’s doorstep.

I worked with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce
nuclear stockpiles,
I worked with China to increase pressure on North Korea.
Our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change,
which Trump now wants to rip up.

Trump wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of
Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a
trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the
1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine
that with his comments about defaulting on our debt.

He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength.

He said, “You’ve got to give KimJongUn credit” for taking over North
Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat,
including his own uncle.

We need to take out ISIS-strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying
the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish
forces on the ground.

We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria’s civil war and close
Iraq’s sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS
alive.)
We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence
services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that
supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists.
Trumps’s actually said “maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.”
Sure, let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the
Middle East.
Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground
troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.
He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which
would mean mass civilian casualties.
Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground
war. These are all distinct possibilities with Trump in charge.
His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from entering our country is a
huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries
we need to actually help us in this fight.
I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating
the potential Osama operation. The President’s advisors were divided.
The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of
failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle
against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the
lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.",geopolitics,climate change

I’m merely an ordinary redditor with an interest in the developing geopolitical situation. I wrote this because I wanted to start a discussion here, gauge what others think about the situation, and see if some of the observations and assumptions I made are wildly off base or shared by some of you.
 
---
 
I firmly believe we are in the midst of a new and completely different Cold War of the 21st century. Where the 20th century was defined by ideological differences (democracy/capitalism vs communism/fascism), the 21st century will be defined by a rapidly evolving, crowded, and shrinking world. Further globalization, the Internet, space technology, cyber warfare, and many other new factors have all brought us to into a geopolitical climate that is very different from what it was even 25 years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed. The new century has brought on new circumstances. While we often look to the past to gauge the future, it is hard to do so now with the rapid development of technology. Many experts and even Russian and US officials themselves do not believe a Cold War is happening, I think the current geopolitical climate has evolved into something were not familiar with; akin to a new and different Cold War where the US and Russia once again see each other as geopolitical adversaries.
 
It’s a major consensus that US-Russia relations are at the lowest they’ve been in decades. The US, as it has always had before, is interested in power projection across the globe. While the current political climate in the US is turbulent, US foreign policy and military doctrine remain the same as they have since the end of WWII, nothing is changing (see the constant development of new technologies and upkeep of global military installations, Iraq, Lybia). Russia, finally confident in its military strength and posture again, has decided it wants to spread its sphere of influence where it can (see Georgia, Ukraine, Syria). 
 
What we have here is a dangerous geopolitical climate. While dangerous, I personally believe we are past the point of MAD and past the point of having nuclear annihilation looming over our heads like it was during the Cold War, **at least for the moment**. In the opinion of senior military officials, a limited nuclear exchange is not out of the realm of possibility for Russia. [^1]( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-risk-of-nuclear-attack-rises/). If there were to be a direct conflict between NATO and Russia, it wouldn’t necessarily result in a full scale nuclear war. All parties recognize that MAD exists, and will do what is required to avoid total destruction. Nevertheless, the threat of direct conflict between Russia and the US is ever present and feared. This leads me to believe that the Cold War we are facing today is vastly different from the one of the 20th century.
 
Where do things go from here? Honestly, in the next few years, I have no clue, no one does. My hope is that [diplomacy will prevail]( http://www.rferl.org/a/syria-russia-us-talks-to-resume/28049477.html) and we can find solutions to the complex situation in Syria and abroad. The coming presidential election in the US will definitely determine how the geopolitical landscape will evolve for the next four years (and further). What I can tell you that in the next few *decades*, as Arctic ice melts and new and important shipping lanes open in the north, Russia and the US/NATO will take it upon themselves to project their spheres of influence northward. [^2]( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-arctic-frontier-lesley-stahl/) Additionally, as China solidifies its economic and military prowess, it desires to evolve into a third geopolitical superpower, further complicating the landscape. Things will only get more complicated as we stumble blindly forward into the future.
 
What do you think? Are we facing a repeat of the destruction and death we experienced in the 20th century? Worse? Will diplomacy and peace prevail? Feel free to comment and discuss below.

I would suppose everyone here is familiar with reports like the [Stern Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review) on the economics of Climate Change? The TL:DR of which is that it's vastly cheaper to not cause Climate Change in the first place than it is to deal with it.
          
Nonetheless we as a global community still pollute on a ""business as usual"" trajectory, heading full steam towards the worst impacts. Collective action to avoid disaster appears very difficult to orchestrate. Too many people are apparently thinking that even if it is cheaper overall to avoid it than to meet it, they can't be sure that others won't pollute if they refrain from doing so themselves
          
Given that we have made collective international action on some forms of pollution (e.g Ozone depleting gases, dumping waste at sea), there's surely some price the World is willing to pay to deal with it.

A concerned citizen may be under the impression that their government is all but extending an invitation to ISIS members, or that there is literally no threat whatsoever from immigration, depending on which news channel they watch.

The right is falling back on it's favorite tactic... xenophobia. Meanwhile the left attempts to use humor and ""dis"" analogy to give the impression our fears are unfounded and even ""nonsense"", to use the words of the op-editor for the NYT.

Yet if one even takes a minute to step inside the mindset of ISIS it seems imprudent to pretend the threat is ZERO. After all, whatever the complex historical and social causes behind their ideology, it seems clear that they would like nothing more than to cause as much death, mayhem, and fear in the west as possible. If they CAN exploit the refugee crisis to infiltrate the west with jihadi fanatics, they surely will. I can guarantee you they have been and are thinking about it. Also, given the nature of ISIS own propaganda campaign of horrific brutality and cruelty, their ranks must be swollen with particularly die hard fundamentalists, who are angry and disaffected. Precisely the kind of person to send on a suicide mission.

So, it seems what we have is a trade off. On the one hand the West wants to be a moral leader and offer humanitarian aid, which will also hopefully have the added benefit of helping to build bridges between cultures, and help dispel the myth that the West is anti-Islam. On the other hand, despite what the left is saying, it seems like any reasonable human being would be justified in thinking that their is at least some threat. The liberal stance on this issue (at least those trying to give the impression there is no risk) reminds me of the far rights utter denial of anthropogenic climate change.

So, my question... how would one go about trying to analyze the threat posed by Syrian immigrants? My guess is that there is a complicated patch-work of ethnic and religious groups inside Syria. I imagine all of these groups don't pose an identical risk, given ISIS ideology, and the fact that it's probably more appealing to some than others. I imagine it would also be advantageous to know how many Syrian nationals have joined ISIS (this may be impossible to know). Presumably all of this information could be used to try and device a screening process which minimizes the risk. I don't think it's enough for the left to just dismiss the risk, I think they need to explain and defend this position. Otherwise, no doubt, they are going to get killed at the polls.

This I'm aware is a touchy subject and I don't want to see an inferno break out like happened on my last post.

I'm seeing a few worrisome signs that international politics is becoming more racialized:

-Venezuela publicly characterizing Trump's speech at the UN as ""white supremacist"", and Trump embracing the whole ""clash of civilizations"" rhetoric on a global scale (up to including calling for the destruction of North Korea - the nation, not the regime - if they attack or threaten American allies)

-in 2016, the (since deposed) leader of the Gambia calling the ICC an ""International Caucasian Court"" that discriminates against Africans

-increasing right-wing populist movements, especially in the US but also to some extent in Europe, that include a substantial proportion of alleged or overt racists

For now at least, the racial angle is only prominent in the US and to some extent Canada (most tensions in Europe either involve Muslims, Roma, or immigrants from one European country to another - Africans, Asians, Latin Americans all seem to be generally tolerated if they aren't Muslim or Roma), but I'm definitely seeing long-term concerns (on and offline, including on /r/Europe) about population growth in Africa and Asia and fear of Sub-Saharan African migrants, including Christians, which could reflect a more ""racial"" way of thinking.

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

___________

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.


_________

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.
