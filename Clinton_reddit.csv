Edit: to all those who think I am still a Trump supporter, just so you all know, I WAS a Trump supporter, but have become extremely disillusioned with him and his administration. I plead to other Trump supporters to open your eyes and mind about him, being a little more skeptical about who he is, and his actions. I have learned he is a CONMAN, and he is no different from previous presidents before him, including Obama, Bush, and Clinton, PROBABLY worse.


We must stand up to him. We must not blindly obey him just because he said he was going to drain the swamp and you think he's playing 420D backgammon Chinese checkers. It's all bullshit, he's full of bullshit, and you all need to OPEN your eyes.

This is r/conspiracy for fuck's sake, NOT r/the_scumbag, or any other biased subreddit.

Be skeptical of ALL authority.


Edit2: I never voted for Trump. I stopped supporting him before election day. I bought into his bullshit during the beginning of his campaign when he was promising to drain the swamp, but I eventually realized how much we've been played and DUPED by this fuckwad.

6,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15928.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

Page 38

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

P., which provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in violation of Rule 33

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 

(Missing pages)

Page 225

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later? 

-	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.

Page 228

-	Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 

-	A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

Page 195

\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\[ed\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\[Ms. Maxwell’s\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”

Page 234

\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.

\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time

Page 243

\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.

\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.

Page 244

\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.

\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.

\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.

Page 245

\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.

\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was ""the boss"" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.

\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.

\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.

\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**

\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.

Page 246

\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.

\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.

Page 264

\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.

\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.

\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.

Page 265

\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.

\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.

Page 266

\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.

\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.

\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.

Page 268

\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.

\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.

Page 269

\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:

Page 270

\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.

Page 271

\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.

\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.

\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13

\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.

\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.

Page 273

\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.

Page 274

\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.

\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.

\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.

\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.

\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**

Page 275

\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.

\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.

\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.

\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.

Page 276

\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.

\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.

Page 277

\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.

\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page23 of 74 16 Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while she was a minor. The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.

Page 278

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.

\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.

Page 279

\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.

\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.

\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.

Page 280

\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.

Page 282

\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”

\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe

\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”

\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.

\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”

\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.

\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”

Page 283

\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.

\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”

\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.

\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;

\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.

\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”

\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”

\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.

\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”

\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.

\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”

Page 284

\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.

\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”

\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”

\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.

\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”

\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads

Page 285

**The Black Book**

\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.

\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.

\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.

\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.

**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**

\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.

\- The books he ordered are titled:

(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24

\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.

Page 287

**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**

\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.

\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.

\- On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.

\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",conspiracy,Clinton

Dark to Light!***

In September 2015 Virginia Roberts Giuffre (VRG) sued Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation in New York federal court.  The documents unsealed today by Judge Preska are those that were filed under seal in that case in 2015.

There is overlap with older released documents, so some of this may not be new.  More will be released Monday.

(Edit: Two Clinton judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals [delayed release of the 2016 deposition] (https://www.newsweek.com/ghislaine-maxwell-deposition-release-delayed-appeals-court-1522099) until September 22.)

[**The source documents are here.**](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/giuffre-v-maxwell/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)  The link may be down at times.

I am finding that all of the so called compilation PDFs, ZIPs, and dumps are incomplete or parts of the old Epstein docs of 2019.  [Exhibit 15 always seems to be missing, which implicates Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7010927/Virginia-Giuffre-Interview-2011.pdf) Only go to the source for the complete unsealed documents.  

[**These are the older Epstein files released in 2019, a 2,024 page PDF**](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html).

There is some confusion about what documents are old and what is newly unsealed, which may be deliberate attempts to muddy the waters.

42,2 years of compiled research available as PDF download or video format proves Pizzagate is 100% real. I have enough evidence for law enforcement in America to open up a real investigation.,6236.0,hn7crw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hn7crw/2_years_of_compiled_research_available_as_pdf/,1113.0,1594170479.0,"**EDIT: I don't have time to reply to everyone right now, but I will be leaving a detailed reply very soon. I will link in the comments. All you shills have zero effect on me. Keep drinking your cognitive dissonance cocktails.**

**Website:** [**www.seanspeaks.co.uk**](https://www.seanspeaks.co.uk) 

Hello people of the world. My names Sean. I am in investigative journalist who has covered Pizzagate extensively for the past 4 years. For anyone new to this subject, **pizzagate is about the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children in Satanic Rituals.** Its crazy how John Podestas leaked emails lead to this dark, satanic, pedo underworld where they do all this horrible stuff to kids. This scandal broke in November 2016 right before the presidential election. Since that day a massive disinformation campaign has been initiated to shut down all discussions of Pizzagate online. The Government and controlled Zionist mainstream media have done a fantastic job at completely discrediting the story without acknowledging any of the facts.

I have created this content in a easy, informative manner, to take the viewer on the same journey I did. **Caution: If you go down this rabbit hole it will completely change your perspective on life and the world around you.** Once you fully come to terms with what Pizzagate is actually about, it turns your stomach sick and compels you to do something about it.

Pizzagate is a giant jigsaw puzzle. When looking into this subject you need to treat it as if you were a detective investigating a crime. You would look at all the evidence to determine if the people implicated are involved in criminal activity or not. Pizzagate is an accumulation of circumstantial evidence which leads to one logical conclusion. **Serious corruption at the highest echelons of Government involving the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children.** The state will do anything, and everything in their power to stop this story from being fully understood by the public.

The evidence I have put together for you proves, without a shadow of a doubt, Pizzagate is real. It proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that law enforcement in the US must open up an investigation into Pizzgate immediately. **To be clear, that is what we need. A real investigation for trained professionals within the law.** This is not something people like me or you should be doing online. I have created my work this way so no one can argue and call it ***""fake news""***, or a ***""conspiracy theory"".*** My content is truthful, factual, and legitimate. End of story.

Once you fully understand the severity of this scandal. What you do about it is down to you. If you want to take a stand and fight back, for the sake of all the innocent children, then share this document far and wide. Share my videos on as any social media platforms as possible. Send my documents into law enforcement in you really want to. Call politicians, do something. We cannot sit back and allow this to go on any longer. If theres one thing we can all agree on, regardless our political or religious beliefs, of even the colours of our skin, **ITS THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN.**

Please help me wake as many people up as possible to the dark, sinister truth, which is Pizzagate. My presentation is part or the larger compendium which is called **#FREEDOMGATE.**  Freedomgate is my creation. Its a movement that all people of the world can get involved with for free. Freedomgate is about liberation, revolution, and freedom, for the entire human race. Full details can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate\_the\_revolution\_of\_the\_human\_race\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate_the_revolution_of_the_human_race_is/)

Please view my work in your own time. I just want to say that I love every single one of you who are out there fighting the good fight. We all just need to stick together, ride the wave, and see where it takes us. Thank you for reading. I appreciate you being here.

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""

Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated.

Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Clinton

It's truly incredible to see content like this on the ""mainstream"" subs, even if it's only fleeting.

Remember when reddit started out with a 9/11 conspiracy thread?

They spent a decade+ trying to reverse that and cultivate a more ""palatable"" website for TPTB, but a generation is now being raised on memes, and they no longer have the patience (or attention span) for the legacy fake news media.

I immediately had a vision of the impending memeification of Epstein's ""death"" the moment I saw the news that fateful day.

In a post-epstein world, *everyone* has become a conspiracy theorist, so the term in effect has lost all of its meaning.

I have always found for myself and others that reading, has a bigger impact on conveying a message rather than watching someone speak to you from a television screen.

*Why is this on r/conspiracy?*

Well first of all he uses the word conspiracy twice. Second of all, I believe this is the first time in a critical moment of history we've had a Presidential Candidate calling the establishment a criminal cartel along with the media conspiring against the people of America. Regardless of what you believe to be the truth I thought it important that as truth seekers you all had an opportunity to read this and apply to the puzzle we all try to piece together on a daily basis.

**Recent Conspiracies:**

Political:

- The Secret Correspondence Between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/545738/

- The indictment of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, suggested that the president’s top lieutenant for part of last year was a highly paid agent for pro-Russian foreign interests. And the guilty plea extracted from George Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser, confirmed the second known attempt by Mr. Trump’s team to tap Moscow for damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, coming months before his son Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for the same purpose. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-manafort-indictment-analysis.html

- Inside Hillary Clinton’s Secret Takeover of the DNC, by Donna Brazile. Per an agreement between the Clinton Campaign and the DNC: In exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings. https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

- In its self-described ""pied piper"" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new ""mainstream of the Republican Party"" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning, telling the press to take Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruz seriously, rather than marginalizing them. http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/

Science Whistleblowers and information about little known problems in science: 

- ""Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government.

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

- Of the 84,000 chemicals in commercial use in the United States -- from flame retardants in furniture to household cleaners -- nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision. The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html

The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate.

The former senator then explained to a befuddled moderator, ""I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is"".

The response from across the tech world was instant and consisted of mockery-laden comments from the likes of Edward Snowden and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen. With Snowden pointing to the instant alienation of nearly all tech-savvy voters;

>[Aaaaaaaaand Hillary just terrified everyone with an internet connection.](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/678396357145686016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Displaying a professed wanton ignorance surrounding the importance of privacy rights within the Democratic party, Hilary seemed to double down on her lack of understanding surrounding her voting base with the following perplexing statement;

>I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project — something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.

Ms. Clinton's stance is quite confusing in light of the fervent tone of the discussion surrounding attempts by government agencies to use ""back door"" technologies to undermine personal security on technological devices. 

Perhaps a glaring testament to her age and unwillingness to understand the issues facing contemporary voters, Ms. Clinton was brazen enough to actually acknowledge her own ignorance with regards to the very policy proposal she had just put forth.

This is, perhaps, a fitting tribute to an American political sphere dominated by bought-and-paid-for news coverage; which presents vacuous controversy as the epitome of informed opinion while neglecting the core tenets of a legitimate political order as reflected in the opinions of the polity.

What can be said of a Republic wherein public officials not only do not consider themselves beholden to public opinion, but mock the very nature of democratic participation by encouraging policies directly contrary to the will of the constituency?

What can be said of a country that can do nothing in the face of monopolized television/newspaper interests, which shove candidates down the throat of an unwilling polity ad nasuem?

I am left to wonder how Americans can look themselves in the face in light of current developments without feeling a hopeless, fleeting, sense of uselessness in the face of large scale corporate-political machines. It's one thing to rue the loss of a vibrant democracy, it's another matter entirely when the reverberations of that decay come in the form of brazen public calls for ""A Manhattan project for the internet"" from the mouth of a self-professed ignorant charlatan. 

If these words, proclaimed by Ms. Clinton from on high, do not spell the end of her legitimacy as a candidate in the modern world, then our Republic is dead; and we have killed it. ",conspiracy,Clinton

I have followed the Hunter Biden saga for years. Allow me to sum up and address some of the disinformation that is part of the modified limited hangout being run.

First, there are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Is Hunter Biden a pedo? Yes. He searches for underage porn. He is constantly accused of being a child molester. He sleeps with Natalie Biden. He sleeps with young cousin Lilly. He engages in grooming behavior and is likely providing drugs to underage family members.

There do appear to be nudes of Natalie in the data.

But, his criminality doesn't stop there. I get that people want the salacious stuff, first, but keep in mind, Hunter Biden participates in policy decisions with the President of the United States.

Hunter Biden engages in a lot of illegal behavior, which makes him blackmailable. This is a National Security concern.

His payments to Ukrainian based escort service, UBERGFE, triggered a bank red flag, as over $200k was paid to them. The SAR was leaked.

https://i.redd.it/cik0p525pza91.png

In early 2019, Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca email password, along with all Rosemont Seneca passwords were leaked.  Even prior to that, the corruption surrounding Hunter Biden and Rosemont Seneca was already widely reported on.

This corruption is merely an extension of what Hillary Clinton began with the Uranium One scandal, where the mining/energy complex is consolidating power monopolistically.

rareddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mzj07/the_smoking_radioactive_gun_uranium_one/

In fact, we see an extension of these globalist type plans for American resources plain as day in Hunter's data.

https://i.redd.it/ha341tgur5b91.png

I don't really have an opinion on the originating laptop dropped off for repair, but I suspect that the leak was inevitable because Hunter Biden's accounts were already compromised by run-of-the-mill Internet investigators. The flood gate was already opened. From where I sat, I was concerned the laptop repair story was exceedingly convenient. But, whatever.

In October 2020, the first drip occurred publicly. I was sent a mega link that is now expired, that contained some of the laptop material.

This was (approximately) the first sample I received. It is SFW and the most damning thing is evidence of a wire transfer from Chinese Intelligence asset to Hudson West III LLC. The rest was a bit random.

https://pic8.co/a/02bddee7-bdef-44ec-8cc4-0197cfad55e9/

Less than a week later, I was sent a much larger collection of images, this time with EXIF data and other corroborating information that showed the majority of what I was looking at was authentic.

We already know the emails and banking records are real per the FOIA request. A number of emails can also be verified with DKIM authentication and also by being able to see both sides of the conversation (like with Devon Archer's emails from his own account to and from Hunter Biden.)

>DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. This is done by giving the email a digital signature. This DKIM signature is a header that is added to the message and is secured with encryption.

https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/dkim/

This second, larger set of files included a massive amount of salacious content. The shills surrounding this controversy love to focus on Hunter Biden's genitals in order to distract from the corruption. Indeed, a file named Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 8.57.14 AM.png shows Hunter Biden with his wiener on a piece of pizza.

Many escorts were featured in this data dump and, unlike what was minimally reported on, their faces were visible and uncensored. I ran them all through facial recognition, right away, with mixed results. Indeed, they are mostly escorts but Hallie Biden and other friends, like Ashakai Grant, are also featured with Hunter Biden's wang.

In one of the pictures, Hunter Biden is with his computer where he is logged into PornHub account, RHEast, where he was uploading videos of him and Hallie and others engaged in sexual behavior.

Beau Biden, btw, seemed to be fully aware of this relationship between Hunter and Hallie, where Hunter sent him pictures of acts together. this is why many believe Natalie and or Hunter may be Hunter Biden's biological children.

At this stage, in 2020, the Q movement all but shut down. They had seemed to be waiting for something like this for years, they finally had it all... and the entire Q astroturfing movement completely shut down and Voat deleted itself from the Internet. This was very suspicious. The ""conservative"" news outlets refused to cover what was in the first set of leaks... which was only a portion of the ""hard drive.""

ZeroHedge, Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics... all these outlets I would have expected to jump all over this content... did absolutely nothing. In fact, they even participated in some light disinformation, in some cases.

I posit that the Q movement was a Carlysle Group psyop aided by numerous astroturfing firms like upvotes.club, but also by government contractors like CACI and... QinetiQ.

One concerning aspect of the Hunter Biden data that was available in 2020 was that it heavily featured Natalie Biden. Hunter Biden was in possession of hundreds of her personal pictures. It appeared obsessive.

Beyond the pictures, it became clear that many people were concerned about Hunter Biden's ""sexually inappropriate"" interactions where he is naked and smoking crack in front of Natalie Biden.

What is also concerning, is that, despite being banned from seeing her alone, Hunter Biden is still meeting in secret with Natalie in places like a Whole Foods bathroom. Natalie is on a family outing, then sneaks to the bathroom to meet Hunter Biden... to ""fold clothes.""

By mid 2021, it was clear many people had Hunter Biden data and the ""hard drive"" was repackaged in a variety of ways. With each repacking, data was taken and inserted. I gave up relying on these anonymous dumps and focused on how to verify what was important with the usual OSINT techniques.

Shills will always cry about source, verification and context, so it is important to pre-emptively give it to them to take away their crybaby ammunition.

Now that the issue has gained more steam, you can actually peruse a lot of the emails, yourself.

TMB files has started to gather data... albeit a bit haphazardly:

https://www.tmbfiles.com/search-files/

And the most reliable way to see the new leak is just by downloading the torrent, yourself, and opening in iPhone Backup Extractor.

So, now, here we are again, when every conservative news outlet should be screaming this stuff from the rooftops, but it seems nearly all Hunter Biden posts are getting deleted on all sites, even 4chan, especially Reddit, Twitter is banning people constantly over it... The Q tards are eerily silent.

In short, there is 100% proof of criminality of a variety of types, showing that the Bidens are above the law and will destroy your country for pennies on the dollar.

Hunter Biden will sell out billions of American resources for crack and hookers. He must be stopped. This behavior is ongoing.

>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.

>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.

>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.

>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.

>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”

>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.

>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”

>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.

>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”

>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.

>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.

>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”

>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.

>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.

>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”

>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.

>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.

>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.

>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”

>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).

>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”

>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?

>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.

>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.

>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.

>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”

>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.

>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”

>Correction: February 18, 2018
>An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.

When you go so far into the darkness, it only makes it that much easier to snap back into the light. We have been held in a dark quagmire for so long, have felt the emptiness of what dark truly is, and have made our collective choice to wake the fuck up and move the fuck on from this barbaric system we have constructed. Total chaos it may look like to all of us looking at reality right now. The truth is, change is always happening, and for a new reality that we all collectively want to happen, all old negative belief systems of control and patterns must break down. I have posted many times about the Mayan Calendar and how the 2012 end times scare was truly a new birth of consciousness for man kind. A golden age of consciousness if you will. This has been heavily documented and researched and has been a pretty interesting topic of discussion. 

You may ask where I am going with all of this. What I am leading up to. When you make the personal choice to start finding the truth of our reality, things happen. Synchronicity, Mandela Effect, Law of Attraction, Numerology. You begin to notice patterns and realize things are a lot more connected than you realize and there is a hidden world all around us that we cannot see.

I love quoting Nikola Tesla to make a comparison for this. 

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.""

We all exist on a certain frequency or wave length. Our bodies are dialed into this third dimensional time frame of existence. We all resonate to this frequency, thus we are all in tune with each other and the third dimension itself. If you have heard of Mass Consciousness, it ties into this. This is why group meditations can be so powerful. 

Now, think about if you truly knew the truth of our reality, and could manipulate that global consciousness to your own will. Like a few Border Collies slowly leading a group of sheep in a direction. I hate using the sheep analogy but I hope I am providing a picture for you here. 

Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let's others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others. The Law of One is what this understanding is. Because we are behind a veil of amnesia, and do not truly know or remember everything we have experienced, it makes this illusionary reality seem ""real"" it makes it seem like you are your body and nothing more. It makes it so easy to think and believe that. I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.

This is where this all takes a dark, dark, turn. Some people think God is a fairy tale. That is all fine and dandy. But there is a legitimate group of people. These 8,000 - 8,5000 people believe that Lucifer is God and that he is the true light. They Rebel against creation itself and attack, control, destroy it. 

A lot of them are luciferians. Some are Satanists. The thing is, this all boils down to Zionism. A long, long, deep rooted system of beliefs that has permeated mankinds existence even since the biblical times and has been documented in the Bible. The Israelites being casted away to Babylon. 

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

This brings me to my next horrid truth of reality. ""Satanic"" Sex Rings. The inspiration for this post comes from the repeated comments I see of people saying ""Satanic Sex Rings are Fake"" and ""Satanic Panic all over again""

There is a reason these tales exist in the first place. And I am going to provide proof to you that this world is run, and controlled, by these 8,000 - 8,500, and how they use Satanic Sex Rings, MKUltra Monarch Mind Control, to Split victims personalities. And how blackmail is collected on people wishing to get into power structures or into ""the top of the pyramid"" where access is only given to those that allow themselves to be taped having sex with kids. Or worse...  This is dark stuff, but it needs to be discussed. This is how these 8,000 - 8,500 psychopaths run the world, and also gives them protection from Good people trying to go after them because they ultimately control key positions of power and prevent investigations from going forth. This is why they hate awareness. This is why they hate Unity.

Divide and conquer is their favorite tool. Get your enemy distracted fighting themselves, and they are less of a threat to your own agenda.

Get mankind so hateful towards itself, towards the ""other"" persons skin color and sexual orientation of preference. They stand no chance to take you down when we are busy dividing ourselves.

This is their bread and butter. This is why we have share blue. Why we attract trolls and shills. This is why astroturfing exists. This is why you can follow the money and find out the truth. If you control the world, you control the money. If you control the money, you control the people. If you control the people, you control the world. You control media, you control Big Pharma, you control access to technology. You set up this big ploy of Russia vs United states then while the citizens of both countries are scared and fighting each other, the powers that were sit in the stands laughing and cheering as fellow man destroy themselves, completely oblivious to the spectators looking on and instigating us.

This game is rigged folks. This reality is controlled. The chains have moved from the physical to the spiritual.

This is the big conspiracy. This is where it all leads to.

Please. Watch these videos. Educate yourself. Bring awareness and light to this subject. Drop seeds of truth here and there with friends and family. Look for the truth and you will find it because the truth is within us. The moment you look outside yourself for the truth that is the moment you confirm you do not have the truth. Always truth your own intuition. Your own awareness and gut feelings. 

Let's come together as one, as we truly are. And free this world from the shackles that it has been placed in for thousands of years. I implore you, a fellow human, to please ponder these things and find a way to help in your own manner. We can stop this TODAY if we collectively chose to do so.

Anytime someone says pedophile rings do not exist, link them to this thread. Share these videos and links with them. Let them come to their conclusion and realize that this is indeed happening. Some will refuse. The more mankind awakens, the further some will create lies to continue their safe reality they have created for themselves. This is fine. We cannot push judgments or opinions as we all have our own way of viewing reality and if people wish to remain ignorant to the truth, that is their choice to do so.

We do not need to waste energy attacking each other anymore. Pushing opniions and trying to create a i am right you are wrong scenario only further divides us and builds ego and fills our heads. I have been guilty of it countless times and will be the first to admit that we all make mistakes and I have given in to emotions more times than I can count. It is time we take responsibility for our actions and realize the consequences of the choices we sometimes choose to make. Mistakes are bound to happen and we need to use them as a learning tool instead of a thing we need to avoid at all costs.

Here are some hard hitting links regarding these rings, as well as various personal testimony from woman that have survived sexual abuse torture and trafficking and other horrid cruel things. This needs awareness. These links do not all pertain to International Pedophile rings but shine light and give context where need be. Feel free to copy this whole post if you wish and share it. No need to give credit.

Peter Newsham, Chief of Police for Washington D.C., who also publicly supports Comet Ping Pong owner, James Alefantis, allowed an 11-year-old girl to be charged with 'false report of rape' despite medical accounts of her sexual injuries and findings of multiple samples of semen on her underwear. 

https://archive.md/Sh6gh

Genesis P. Orridge used a familiar excuse (the same as James Alefantis) when they were chased out of UK in the 1980's. Said the charges are ridiculous because ""we have no basement"" in the Psychik TV house.

But, in fact, had a studio they called.... ""The Death Factory""

Your President sexually assaults young girls on camera. Numerous occasions, Joe Biden shows that he has no problem invading boundaries of children who he is a stranger to. He pinched a little girl's nipple on camera. It is bold. But not as bold as rubbing a little girl's hand on his crotch.

Solving the problem of organized pedophilia rings solves the problem of widespread government corruption. These people need trials and the harshest possible sentencing.

Imagine the scumbag astroturfers that think it's okay to help cover this stuff up. It is called obstruction of justice and they should be tried for their participation in RICO, as well.

I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

- On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. One tactic used to undermine Mosaddegh was to carry out false flag attacks ""on mosques and key public figures"", to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Project_TP-Ajax

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

Donald Trump is a scumbag hypocrite that doesn’t care about you and only wants power. He also has multiple sexual allegations against them. He has known Epstein and were great friends for decades. If you love Trump but hate The Clintons you are a fool.



This is how they divide and conquer. They both have a pile of evidence, testimonies against them, an open history of knowing what Epstein did, yet still hung out with him.
Both of them wanted Epstein dead and was scared of information getting out.

Trump and the Clintons are actual friends. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton are literally best friends. Trump has donated to the Clintons and invited the Clintons to his own wedding. He was also very upset that he couldn’t go to Chelsea’s wedding and called many people to talk about how “he should be there.” The Clintons have been bought off by Trumps money (and many many many others) and instead of fighting for the working class they used their powers to help make Trump and other billionaires richer and more powerful. They are literally two sides of the same coin.

Clinton has flown on the Lolita express. Trump has flown on the Lolita express. Trump hired Alexander Acosta who was the Florida prosecutor that gave the most sweetheart deal to Epstein and was the reason Epstein walked free. Clinton was seen on Epstein’s island. There was a picture of Clinton in a dress in Epstein’s house. Trump made comments about knowing that Epstein liked underaged girls back in the 80s yet still partied with him. 


They are both guilty and should not be defended by anyone. They would throw you to the wolves in a second. Do not believe the lifetime of propaganda.",conspiracy,Clinton

The guy is on a first name basis with Saudi oil sheikhs. He's had the Clintons over for his wedding. His cabinet is filled with ex Goldman Sachs executives, he's beloved by Israeli hardliners, and he used to pal around with Epstein. How can anyone say that President Billionaire isn't deep in the fold?

I don’t know how I can put it more clearly: Donald Trump is a second-generation real estate mogul turned President with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. All of his most successful business ventures cater to the ultra wealthy. Who do you think finances his campaign? For crying out loud, the President shits on a gold toilet seat in a Manhattan tower bearing his name and was photographed holding a mysterious glowing orb with the Saudi royal family. Does he have to draw you people a f’n diagram? 

I’ve seen people on this sub claim that since Trump has received so much backlash, it’s clear that the elite have it out for him. I suspect they have more effective means to keep people they don’t like from power than a kabuki-theater impeachment, go nowhere investigations and criticism in the MSM. Maybe I missed something, and the ‘powers that be’ have really softened their touch since the days of JFK, RFK, and MLK. 

I never thought I’d see the day when conspiracy theorists would extend the benefit of a doubt to any P.O.T.U.S., much less one so obviously suspicious. I figured the ‘two wings of the same bird’ mantra applied to politicians of both parties.

I’m only doing this because I care about humanity, my future, my children’s future, oppressed people around the globe, and really the survival of our species in a time when more money and resources is dedicated to weaponry and AI/Tech than ever before.

The first rule you need to know is conspiracy theorist was a weaponized term by the CIA to make people fall in line, and ridicule anyone who opposed the status quo narrative. Politicians LOVE this term, because it enables their goals while simultaneously encouraging you to mock anyone who speaks out.

The second rule is everything you have heard regarding conspiracies, while it contains falsehoods, is relatively true in one way or another. This is just a Reddit post intended to point you in the right direction so I won’t make a super in depth post but I encourage all to do their due diligence and research these subjects, as I’ve learned it’s the only way the majority will reach *the truth* anyways. 

Freemasonry, CIA, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, United Nations, Vatican, FBI, NSA, Mossad, M16, Federal Reserve, CCP, etc.

Learn right now that there are people in this world so powerful they influence everything you see and hear on a daily basis. The hardest part to accepting this all, is like The Matrix Movie on a tiny scale. Everything is fake, manufactured, planned, and coordinated. 


“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812).

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions) 

Bush = evil. Clinton = evil. Obama = evil. Older Bush = evil.   HERES the difference.. Trump = somewhat disrespectful idiot who is not a career politician or ties to public office (senate/house/president/VP) but actually likes America and opposes the Globalist agenda. 

Twitter is compromised. Reddit is compromised. Facebook is compromised. Even this sub = compromised. Operation Mockingbird is in full effect every day in here to sway public opinion. ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people. 

“I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.” - Harry S Truman, President of the United States.

Love yourself. Love your neighbor. Love and peace is the only thing that can conquer all. Educate yourself. Educate others. Understand atheism is a carefully crafted lie to make you believe this is all there is to life. Understand we have a purpose. There is more than meets the eye in this materialistic and corporatist society we currently inhabit, and all truths will eventually rise to the surface. Don’t lose faith.

Edit: to understand how this sub is compromised, look at almost every top comment. It’s not discussing the material, or the main parts of what’s being implied here, but rather every comment is nitpicking anything I said about Trump, and only Trump. In my original post, I claim Trump is a bad person. An imbecile. Can’t say a speech to save his life. Disrespectful. Just a non intelligent human being. Nor does he do honorable things like release tax returns or present real forward thinking ideas or policies. I end it with acknowledging *no matter what candidate takes office the next 4 years will be hell.* However, the shill crowd immediately comes in and glosses over the MAIN parts of what I’m saying here, which is conspiracy theories related to government and politics are for the most part true, to research agencies and institutions that contribute to the stripping of your rights in modern day propaganda in broad daylight, especially the CIA.",conspiracy,Clinton

207,What I learned from my 2-week hiatus from Reddit,1601.0,6m77wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6m77wg/what_i_learned_from_my_2week_hiatus_from_reddit/,273.0,1499603797.0,"I recently visited a country that, much to my surprise, banned Reddit. Yes, I could've used a VPN but there was too much going on to really sit down and browse much anyway.

And in the two weeks of being detached from conspiracies (and the news in general), I learned this: a lot of it is a distraction that justifies our procrastination towards personal and unified greatness. It is, quite honestly, pointing a finger towards something else and ignoring the three pointing back at ourselves. We can read about war mongering overseas and don't contemplate the way we stereotype others. We can discuss the use of herbicide but then buy conventional produce instead of going organic. Or condemn Clinton and Podesta while doing nothing to strengthen our own moral compass.  

Upon reflection, I realize that focusing on conspiracies is sort of like Sodom and Gomorrah, and getting turned into a pillar of salt for looking back and watching the place burn. The only way out is forward: unmitigated, consistent focus on solutions and relentless self-improvement.  That's it. Because 97% of us can do absolutely nothing to ""take down TPTB"" in the way that we generally think (ie, combat, antagonism, etc). Exposure is valuable, yes, but only if it leads to meaningful change. 

It's getting to the point that I'm thinking if I comment on a conspiracy, I absolutely have to have some type of imperative or action-based statement accompanying it. Or, if I cannot spare the precious energy in the form of my attention, I should offer another form of it which is money (ie, donating to alternative news sites and YouTuber's). 

Our power lies in our ability to extricate ourselves from the awful--and often false--constructs manufactured in our society. For example, we can stop waiting for the oil industry to crumble and switch to solar within our homes. Downsize our vehicles or go electric. We can stop waiting for laws to be made that prevent degradation of the planet and go to a plant-based diet. We can stop worrying about the water scarcity problem and start rain harvesting, buy low water use toilets, re-design the backyard with drought tolerant plants, etc. 

For every such conspiracy-related problems (and there are many), we already have solutions. If we become that change, the problem ceases to exist. 

I understand that conversation among each other is extremely valuable... but what we say is important, too. Often our chatter is discussing the great and mighty powers of ""the elite"" and we seldom talk about the great and mighty power within ourselves, how we can enhance it, and how we can channel it to better humanity. 

I say this to everyone because I have been guilty of this procrastination. I look through my post history and if I'm honest, recognize that the majority of my comments are based in knowledge, sure, but not wisdom. Most of this sub are discussing a movie and obsessively complaining about how terrible it is, only to realize we have the power to hit the ""mute"" button and walk away from it. Not knowing the movie's plot doesn't necessarily make one ignorant or a lesser person, and in fact, they're far better off if instead of watching the movie, they're out contributing to a food bank or volunteering at a soup kitchen. 

I know I will always be drawn to the conspiracy community for its valuable insights. But the two weeks away from it reinforced that knowledge must be accompanied with action. And sometimes, one does not even need a great deal of conspiracy knowledge to fight the exact problems we all seek to expose here.

I love this community and its posters. The insights shared here equip all of us to be powerful agents of change. I hope we all learn to leverage our knowledge into action--I know I have a long way to go, but my hiatus sharpened my focus on the ""self-improvement"" part. 

I also hope we can become more solutions-oriented around here. I'll do my best to facilitate that as a poster, and I hope this post compels others to at least think about the usefulness in doing the same. ",conspiracy,Clinton

212,Just a note. People who have been here a while are neither Trump or Hillary supporters. We support the idea of equal justice. That the rich and powerful shouldn't be immune to prosecution.,1569.0,76y014,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76y014/just_a_note_people_who_have_been_here_a_while_are/,509.0,1508240871.0,"I see so many Hillary supporters on here (probably paid for by ShareBlue or just radicalized on their own) claiming that we are Trump supporters. And then, on the other end, we get brigades from Donald supporters. It's strange that /r/conspiracy has become the battleground for the political ideas on Reddit since /r/politics has become a place where you just get the DNC establishment narrative and has been abandoned by people who want to find the truth.

But let me try to explain the slight support of Trump that comes naturally here compared to the disdain toward Hillary. Hillary is a proven swamp monster. She is proven to be above the law. With Trump, there was a slight hope that the swamp would be drained. He ran on that, although he may have just been lying. We'll see, but he wasn't a proven swamp monster. He may be one. If so, he is just more of the same to us conspiracy minded people. Nothing different. Nothing to be more outraged about than we were before. But he may not be a swamp monster. With Hillary, we have a proven swamp monster of the greatest sort running free from any justice. 

As if anyone can speak for the conspiracy community as a whole, but we are generally a group for justice. And we wouldn't be upset if Trump would be prosecuted for wrongs that he does. But we would really like to see the swamp monsters prosecuted and not just use the justice system used by the powerful to go after their political opponents while they get off for equal or worse crimes. 

So if Trump is prosecuted for Russian interactions, then Hillary should be too. And whoever else was involved in the bribes for uranium through the Clinton Foundation. We don't want to see justice unfairly given toward one side or the other. 

So the post trying to connect Trump more to Epstein than Bill Clinton who was actually a frequent flyer comes across as very disingenuous. Although, it has received a lot of traction here for some reason. But it's hypocritical to be outraged at Trump's connections to him and not totally outraged at the Clintons, who are, unfortunately, still relevant to our political environment.

But the mainstream media only pushes for justice to be given to Trump, and that keeps our conspiracy antennas on high alert. If they were also going after crimes committed during the Obama administration the same way, you wouldn't feel that we were taking a side. We just want equal justice. We desire a society free or corruption. At the core, I think that is what most of us conspiracy people are about. 

TLDR: We just want justice. Equally served.",conspiracy,Clinton

>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.

*  Do these attempted assassinations require a new mode of thinking in terms of preventing terrorism? How does this situation compare to previous instances of terrorism-by-mail? Have these events instead been an indication that the system is working?
* What, if any, will be the fallout as far as the midterms are concerned? Will politicians seize on this issue as a campaign wedge, or instead use it as a unifying factor?
* Is there responsibility on the part of political actors for these events, or should the actions be viewed as exclusively the isolated actions of terrorists?

> WASHINGTON — A new trove of emails that appear pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was discovered after the F.B.I. seized at least one electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.

> The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands — potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.

In the weeks leading up to an incredibly contentious election, how should federal and state agencies such as the FBI, handle the release of new information that may impact the election?

Should these agencies adhere to their standard operating procedures regardless of their political climate? Should they add nuance to their releases to thwart potential distortion by media reporting? Should these agencies ever delay the release of important information?

This story also raises questions about the politicization of Congressional Committees. Can and should federal agencies push back against what they view to be unduly partisan requests from committees? Or does the importance of Congressional Oversight mean that agencies ought to always fulfill requests for information from Congress promptly?

The FBI is the latest example of government agencies acting and releasing information in the context of the election, but it is not the first. At the [beginning of the month](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html), the Democratic State Attorney General in New York issued a cease and desist to the Trump Foundation and required that all financial documents be turned over within 15 days.

This story now is getting very thorough coverage on [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-leaders-in-congress-remain-mum-on-biden-sexual-assault-allegations-despite-moutning-uproar-from-progressives) and more prominent Right Wing and even more liberal websites. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign and most prominent Democrats have not responded further.  
  
How serious are these claims now, how will they play into the general election? There seemed to be a hope that these claims would just disappear after not getting much media play initially, but the new video may give them more life. And knowing the Trump campaign and how he treated Bill Clinton's assault allegations in 2016, I am sure he will bring this up, as his surrogates are already doing. And how should the Biden campaign and Democrats respond? They are caught in a tough place as previously Democrats were very aligned with the #MeToo movement over the last few years. Should Biden respond to these allegations himself or let his surrogates dismiss them?  
  
Edit: As an update, today [new information came out](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4) supporting Reade's statements earlier on. Both a former neighbor of Reade's and a colleague confirmed that Reade had told them various details that match her claims in the 90's. Most notably her neighbor, who states she is a Democrat and is even going to vote for Biden, states that Reade described the assault in great detail. Now CNN's Chris Cillizza [is saying](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/biden-tara-reade-senate/index.html) Biden should address these allegations directly.",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

Clinton argues that Trump has strayed from *bipartisan* foreign policy, and this seems like an appeal to moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats.  To me it seems like a general election speech, ignoring Sanders and his supporters entirely.

Do you think Clinton will be able to eat into Trump's support by emphasizing foreign policy?  How will she deal with Benghazi if Trump brings it up?  Is this a better line of argument for her than the economy at home (although she does suggest a strong economy and infrastructure is part of a strong foreign policy)?

What political or cultural shifts has caused this?",923.0,muj7w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/muj7w4/starting_in_the_mid_2000s_the_frequency_of/,576.0,1618895314.0,"It's well known that America has a unique mass shooting problem.

According to this [graph,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/811487/number-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us/) America has seen the amount of mass shootings steadily climb since the year 2004. I don't know exactly how Statista defines a ""mass shooting,"" but this is the only graph I could find that goes back until the 80's. I believe that the curve itself is well represented, as it is roughly corroborated by [this](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) data from Mother Jones.

Note that, from 1982 to \~2004, America saw relatively few mass shootings, compared to recent years. But, starting in 2004, the frequency of mass shootings has been steadily rising. The question I'm trying to ask is:

**What political/cultural events has started this sudden shift in 2004? And why does it get worse every year?**

Because it's relevant, I will outline some facts about American firearm ownership, but here's a disclaimer- I am NOT debating/debunking the effectiveness of gun control measures, nor am I seeking to push any agendas. That is not the purpose of this post. I'm trying to understand the *root psychological and/or cultural cause* of America's violence epidemic.

Because, while guns are a major component in mass shootings (as in, shootings cannot occur without a gun), *the American availability of firearms doesn't seem to be the only factor.*

* From 1982, up until the assault weapons ban, gun control was relatively lax. During that time period, America saw relatively few mass shootings (compared to recent years), which may show that the availability of firearms didn't really effect mass shootings.
* Consider that in Switzerland, a country with [only light gun control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland) (it's comparable to the US, though not *quite* as lax), mass shootings are [exceedingly rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_shootings_in_Switzerland). *Why might this be?*

It's worth noting that the [Federal Assault Weapons Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Definition_of_assault_weapon) expired in 2004, which does correlate with our sudden spike, though [the actual effectiveness of the AWB (in the stopping of mass shootings) is debated.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/07/bill-clinton/did-mass-shooting-deaths-fall-under-1994-assault-w/)

So, with that background information, what could've caused this sudden spike?

EDIT: Some legitimate concerns have been raised about the data, I have this in response: 

On the definition of ""mass shooting:"" Notoriously difficult to actually define. My second source, the Mother Jones page that tracks mass shootings, uses this definition:

https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2012/08/what-is-a-mass-shooting/

I am unsure if my first source (the Statista graph) uses the same definition (Likely not). However, it is important to note that the trend is mirrored in both sources, and so I've decided that the purpose of this post still stands.

Double edit: For those still commenting, I must reiterate the purpose of this post, as I've seen a lot of comments that miss the point. We are seeking to understand *what happened in/ around 2004 to spark this rise in mass shootings.* Many comments are instead a variation on the following:

""America has guns, of course there will be mass shootings.""

Yes, you are right. A mass shooting cannot occur without a gun. But that doesn't answer the question of this post, it only leads to people getting in fights and citing FBI statistics.",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

He argues that a lot of eras end with a failed one-term president.  John Adams leading to Jefferson.  John Q. Adams leading to Jackson.  Hoover to FDR.  Carter to Reagan.  He believes Trump's failure is the death of Reaganism and the emergence of a new second progressive era.  

Reaganism was defined by the insistence of small government and the nine most dangerous words.  He believes even Clinton fit in the era when he said that the ""era of big government is over.""  But, we have played out the era and many republicans did not actually shrink the size of government, just run the federal government poorly.  It led to Trump as a last-ditch effort to hang on to the era but became a failed one-term presidency.  Further, the failure to properly respond to Covid has led the American people to realize that sometimes big government is *exactly* what we need to face the challenges of the day.

* How can Hillary, in light of the allegations levied against her own husband, capitalize on this news?

* What voting bloc is this news likely to play worst with? Why? What group is least likely to be moved by this story?

But the story also raises questions about the state of American politics and Presidential campaigning.

* Are Presidential candidates under greater scrutiny from the media, their opponents, and the public than they were in the past? If so, do you view this as a favorable or unfavorable development?

* Should a candidate's sexual history, in general, be fair play for the media and opponents, or should candidates be granted some amount of privacy? Does the added element of alleged non-consensuality change the media's responsibility to either report on it or not?

* How might such allegations have played 100 years ago? 50 years ago? 20 years ago? If there's a difference between how influential such allegations might have been over the years, what has given rise to that change? Is it cultural changes, demographic changes, a new journalistic paradigm, or something else entirely?

* Do you believe that such allegations *ought* to play into voting behavior? Do these allegations change, in your view, how effective Trump would be as a President and leader? 

* Should Trump have some presumption of innocence in the public view? Why or why not?

Even after his loss in California, while he stopped the attacks against Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders said he would take his agenda to the convention.

However, his remarks on C-SPAN are the most conciliatory remarks he has made thus far.  Not only did he openly acknowledge he probably won't be the nominee, but he implied he won't be ""determining the scope of the convention"" either.

Last week, Wikileaks released a secret internal memo by Democrat campaign strategists to the DNC that was dated April 2015. The memo is [here](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/785615427913199616) but I've also copy and pasted below:

>This	memo	is	intended	to	outline	the	strategy	and	goals	a	potential	Hillary	Clinton	presidential	campaign 	would	have	 regarding	the	2016	Republican	presidential	field.	 Clearly	most	of	what	 is	contained	in	this	memo	is	work	 the	DNC	is	already	doing.	This	exercise	is	intended	to	put	those	ideas	to	paper.	

>Our	Goals &	Strategy

>Our	hope	is	that	the	goal	of	a	potential	HRC	campaign	and	the	DNC	would	be	one-in-the-same:	to	make	whomever	the	Republicans	nominate	unpalatable	to	a	majority	of	the	electorate.		

> We	have	outlined	three strategies	to	obtain	our	goal:	

> 1) Force	all Republican	candidates	to	lock	themselves	into	extreme	conservative	positions	that	will	hurt	them	in	a	general	election;

> 2) Undermine	any	credibility/trust Republican	presidential	candidates	have	to make	inroads	to	our	coalition	or	
independents;

> 3) Muddy	the	waters	on	any	potential	attack	lodged	against	HRC.

>Operationalizing the	Strategy

>Pied	Piper	Candidates

>There	are	two	ways	to	approach	the	strategies	mentioned	above.	The	first	is	to	use	the	field	as	a	whole	to	inflict	damage	on	itself 	similar	to	what	happened	to	Mitt	Romney	in	2012.	The	variety	of	candidates	is	a	positive	here,	and	many	of	the	lesser	known	can	serve	as	a	cudgel	to	move	the	more	established	candidates	further	to	the	right. In	this	scenario,	we	
don’t	want	to	marginalize	the	more	extreme	candidates,	but	make	them	more	“Pied	Piper”	candidates	who	actually	represent	the	mainstream	of	the	Republican	Party.	Pied	Piper	candidates	include,	but	aren’t	limited	to:

>Ben	Carson

>We	need	to	be	elevating	the	Pied	Piper	candidates	so	that	they	are	leaders	of	the	pack	 and	tell	the	press	to them seriously

* 57% chance of winning Arizona.

And 538's polling averages of each state are currently as follows:

* Texas: Trump +0.9
* Georgia: Trump +0.3
* Arizona: Biden +4.8

Taking a longer term view, even if Biden were to lose all three states, it appears likely that he'll perform better in all three than any democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996. This would be a logical progression of what some political analysts believe is a re-shuffling of the electoral map, with the ""rust belt"" becoming more friendly to the GOP and the ""sun belt"" becoming more friendly to the democratic party, helped along by COVID-19.

As we saw in 2016, one of the major factors that Trump contributed his success to on the campaign trail was the additional time spent hosting rallies in battleground states.

After 2016, the common narrative was that the experts had missed the TrumpTrain, and there was much gnashing of teeth about how blindsided folks were. Discussion by Nate Silver and the team at fivethirtyeight.com has shown that this was mostly unnecessary, as the [results](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-are-all-right/) were within [one normal polling error of 2-3%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/). This suggested that people misunderstood the probability of events happening (Trump winning certain states, for example) and were caught off-guard. This of course begs the question ""what about 2018?"" 

I've heard a few stories around Reddit of eager young liberals angry that they were blindsided again, and that the results have been a disaster, far off from expectations. I doubt that perspective very much, and set out to examine that claim. It should be noted that I'm notoriously bad at predictions, and overfit my data due to slow returns; for about two hours, I believed that the Democrats were not on track to win the election and (due to my bias) was apoplectic. If you got a text from me saying, ""God help us all,"" I apologize for having wasted your time.

I have analyzed the 538 predictions and the actual results at the polls, and I present my results here. I focused on the 98 House races that 538 said had less than a 90% certainty. There were 37 Democrats predicted to be winners, and 61 Republicans. I had to manually transcribe results, so this was an attempt to limit the time I needed to copy data over. Additionally, this is the upper-limit of the 80% confidence interval (""80%CI"" from 10% to 90%) that 538 published with their data, so it is a convenient line of demarcation. As of ~5 pm on Wednesday, GA7 and TX23 are too close to call, while OK5 went for the Democrats - these are important, because they were the only potential upsets which were so unlikely as to be excluded from this confidence interval, with predicted probabilities of 91.06%, 95.96%, and 92.38% (respectively). I additionally excluded ME-02 from ""win/loss"" analyses, because the Single Transferable Vote system makes such a determination difficult at this time. The final votes and results may change by certification, but the vote shares are given as of 5 pm as well, from the NYTimes website. The predictions used from 538 are the ""lite"" predictions which are derived from the polls alone.

The 1-sentence summary is that the 538 predictions were very good at both qualitative predictions (who will win) and quantitative predictions (what vote percent will the favored candidate get). 

The 98 races I looked at had an overall average win probability of 72.0%. The projected winner of these races won 84.5% of the time, indicating a better-than-anticipated projection capability. I binned the data into 5% boxes from 50% to 90% and determined how often the predicted winner actually won in each example. For the events with probability less than 60%, 538 was slightly less successful at prediction than their probability, but at higher probabilities, they over performed. (See the Table and Figure below.)

For the vote share, there was an average predicted 80%CI of +/-5.2%. All but two races (WI-01 and FL-25) results were within this confidence interval, a 98% success rate. This indicates that 538 was too conservative in their 80%CI assignment. Using the Excel Solver Add-In, I optimized a function to ensure that only 80% of the results were within the new CI; the observed 80%CI is +/-2.8%, indicating a much tighter correlation between predicted vote share and observed vote share. This also qualitatively fits with the understanding from 2016, that a normal polling error was 2-3%. This ""normal polling error"" helps explain why there were so many upsets in the <60% probability range, as the average predicted vote share for these races was 49.7%, indicating that a 2.8% voter error in the wrong direction could sink a candidate.

Incumbents won 67.6% of the races they were in. Their predicted average win probability was 74.7%, indicating a slight anti-incumbency (7.1%) advantage that the polls did not capture. Democratic incumbents slightly outpaced predictions, averaging 2.5% better voter share than their predicted shares. Republican incumbents hit their voter share predictions almost perfectly, only performing 0.4% better than projected. No Democratic incumbents that were predicted to win lost, but 8 Republican incumbents who were predicted to win lost.

All-in-all, in the most competitive 98 House races, 538's ""lite"" poll prediction method was incredibly accurate. They were within their statistical limits remarkably well, and were overly conservative in their assumption of errors. Their confidence interval was nearly twice as large as the observed confidence interval in this region. There should be high confidence in their predictions using this method moving forward.

I subscribe to a weather blog by a meteorologist called Jeff Masters, who primarily talks about tropical cyclones and seasonal weather extremes. I wouldn't call him a climate change activist or anything, but he does mention it in the context of formerly ""extreme"" weather events seemingly becoming ""the norm"" (for instance, before 2005 there had never been more than one category five Atlantic hurricane in one year, but since 2005 we've had I think four or five years when this has been the case, including 2017). So he'd mention climate change in that context when relevant.

Lately, the comments section of this blog has been tweeted by Drudge Report a few times, and when it does, it tends to get very suddenly bombarded with political comments. On a normal day, this comments section is full of weather enthusiasts and contains almost no political discussion at all, but when it's linked by this conservative outlet, it suddenly fills up with arguments about climate change not being a real thing, and seemingly many followers of Drudge go to the blog specifically to engage in very random climate change arguments.

Watching this over the last few months has got me thinking - what is it that an ordinary, average citizen conservative has to gain from climate change being ignored policy-wise? I fully understand why big business and corporate interests have a stake in the issue - environmentalist policy costs them money in various ways, from having to change long standing practises to having to replace older, less environmentally friendly equipment and raw materials to newer, more expensive ones. Ideology aside, that at least makes practical sense - these interests and those who control them stand to lose money through increased costs, and others who run non-environmentally friendly industries such as the oil industry stand to lose *massive* amounts of money from a transition to environmentally friendly practises. So there's an easily understandable logic to their opposition.

But what about average Joe, low level employee of some company, living an ordinary everyday family life and ot involved in the realms of share prices and corporate profits? What does he or she have to gain from opposing environmentalist policies? As a musician, for instance, if I was a conservative how would it personal inconvenience me as an individual if corporations and governments were forced to adopt environmentalist policies?

Is it a fear of inflation? Is it a fear of job losses in environmentally unfriendly industries (Hillary Clinton's ""put a lot of coal miners out of business"" gaffe in Michigan last year coming to mind)? Or is it something less tangible - is it a psychological effect of political tribalism, IE ""I'm one of *these* people, and *these* people oppose climate policy so obviously *I* must also oppose it""?

Campaign managers for Rubio and Kasich have stated they have plans ""to wrest the Republican nomination from him in a deadlocked convention."" 

But the most interesting thing to me is what McConnell plans if Trump  wins the nomination outright: they will ""run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election.""  They will essentially try to convince voters that Trump will lose and will ""describe a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton.""

A departure from Republican orthodoxy, the proposal expands on a campaign pledge to provide paid maternity leave, which Trump adopted at the urging of his daughter Ivanka.

>Under the plan, states would be required to provide leave payments through existing unemployment insurance programs and would have to identify cuts or tax hikes, as needed, to cover the costs. The administration said this approach would give states flexibility and stressed that the administration would provide support to state governments to help them determine how to fund the program. States could opt out if they created a different paid leave system.

>Still, the approach would put the burden of funding the program on the states. It also could mean that the benefits could vary greatly by location. Democrats have proposed more expansive programs with different funding streams. During the campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton pitched 12 weeks of family leave, paid for by taxes on the wealthy.

>Trump's proposal is unlikely to win much Republican support. But the president has been an advocate of paid leave, mentioning it in his first speech to Congress.

While this is not the longest that a single party has held the Presidency, further fracturing of the Republican party due to the Tea Party movement and the Trump election, as well as primary voters making it nearly impossible to elect moderate candidates, make it seem more and more difficult for the GOP to gain the traction to attract more moderate and undecided voters.

But if Johnson does act as a spoiler for the election, from whom will he take more votes?

Some voting statistics on New Mexico:

In the 2012 Presidential election, Obama beat Romney by about 10%.  Gary Johnson pulled in about 3.5% in the state, a stronger percent than his national average of 1%, but still quite low for someone who was governor of the state twice. (53-43-3.5%) 

In 2012, Martin Heinrich, the now incumbent Democrat Senator from New Mexico, [won with a roughly 6% lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich) over his Republican opponent (51-45%).

In 2016, in the general election for President, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by about 8% (48%-40%).  Yet [Gary Johnson pulled in over 9% support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_New_Mexico,_2016), despite a national average of about 3% support.

Now he's running for a few months for Senate, in a contentious election where many people expect Democrats to make sweeping victories across the country.

Those battleground states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconson, Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina.  

The podcast touched many issues with polling methodologies and how so many of the polls were so wrong in 2016.  The main reason that almost all of the predicted Clinton in a landside was because they claimed that lesser educated people were less likely to participate in political surveys but they still voted and this led to Trump voters being underrepresented in polls.  It was a good podcast that I recommend if you have 30 minutes. 

These polls pitted Trump against each of the top 3 democrats in the race.  The results show that both Sanders and Warren are close when looking at registered voters, but they both get crushed by Trump when looking at likely voters in these 6 states.  Whereas Biden crushed Trump on both categories.  

>Of voters who support Mr. Biden but not Ms. Warren, 52 percent agree with the statement that Ms. Warren is too far to the left for them to feel comfortable supporting her for president, while 26 percent disagree.

The podcast postulated that the other 48 percent of voters who support Biden but not Warren do it because of her gender.

Another interesting thing is there are tons of non-typical democratic voters who support Biden but won't support the others.

>The Biden voters who say Ms. Warren is too far to the left are relatively well educated and disproportionately reside in precincts that flipped from Mitt Romney in 2012 to Mrs. Clinton four years later. They oppose single-payer health care or free college, and they support the Republicans’ 2017 tax law. They are not natural Democratic voters: 41 percent consider themselves conservative; 20 percent say they’re Republican; 33 percent supported Mr. Trump or Mr. Johnson in 2016.

I've parsed through a few of them so far, but I've yet to find anything that seems particularly noteworthy.  There is some rather clear antipathy between the DNC and the Sanders campaign (particularly Jeff Weaver) in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding the Nevada convention - but that hardly seems surprising.

Is there any content in these leaked emails that has the potential to impact the Democratic Convention next week?  Will they have an impact on recent efforts by Sanders and Clinton to promote party unity heading into the general election?

Given Donald Trump's rather overt appeal to Sanders supporters last night (via his claim of the process being rigged), is there a likelihood that his campaign will be able to use the contents of this leak to their advantage?

At current, I have seen limited analysis on both The Hill and Politico if anyone would like to seek them out for further context.

EDIT 2: It was suggested that we also discuss the nature of the relationship between the DNC (and by extension, other political organizations) with the media.  Several of the emails are correspondences either between or regarding media organizations.  At one point, Schultz responds to critical coverage which she felt crossed a line by requesting that the network in question be contacted in order for a complaint to be filed.

>This is the LAST straw. Please call Phil a Griffin. This is outrageous. She needs to apologize. DWS

It seems that there must be a fairly open line of communication between the party apparatus and the media.  Is it common for political operations to lodge direct complaints about coverage or otherwise attempt to directly influence it?  Or is this a part of the typical dialogue that most political operations would maintain with the media?  What are the implications of this kind of relationship?

EDIT 3: Some emails seem to show that DNC officials were specifically planning on how to undermine Sanders' campaign in critical states:

>“It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.

Others demonstrate that Schultz was not particularly a fan of the Sanders campaign's tactics:

I think some of his criticism's are valid. While I do appreciate Bernie's candor and freedom from many of the usual suspect big political donors I certainly think I'd be willing to trade some ethical purity for more pragmatic and workable solutions than Sanders offers.

Krugman hits Bernie on these main points:
*Bernie supporters do not scrutinize Sander's close enough and get very defensive when people try and this sentiment is carrying over to Sanders himself. 
*Sander's rhetoric often doesn't have much in the way of substance behind is, speaking specifically of his ""break up the big banks"" slogan.
*The Sanders Campaign's failure to make any real connections between the money Clinton accepts and any actual influence they have on her.

I'd say this is the money quote:

>Holding people accountable for their past is O.K., but imposing a standard of purity, in which any compromise or misstep makes you the moral equivalent of the bad guys, isn’t. Abraham Lincoln didn’t meet that standard; neither did F.D.R. Nor, for that matter, has Bernie Sanders (think guns).

Every day [new articles](http://www.businessinsider.com/liberals-can-win-if-they-stop-being-so-annoying-2017-7) are published to offer ideas about why Democrats lost so unexpectedly in 2016.

Here are some of those theories (as I interpret them):

* **Policy Direction.** I would say this is the theory [endorsed by](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/opinion/bernie-sanders-where-the-democrats-go-from-here.html) Bernie Sanders (among others). The premise is that Democrats lost because they didn't offer the right policy subscriptions to help bolster the middle class.

* **Identity Politics.** After the election, some [argued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-identity-politics-couldnt-clinch-a-clinton-win/2016/11/11/ed3bf966-a773-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html?utm_term=.db254ba823f9) that Democrats went wrong by leaning too heavily on ""indentity politics,"" loosely defined as making appeals to specific identity groups.

* **Candidate.** I hear this theory less, but the basic idea is that the Democratic Party is in a fine place in terms of policy and direction but that they just ran the wrong candidate. According to the argument, an Obama-like candidate could have run on the same platform and won the election handily against Trump.

* **Culture.** I would say Josh Barro's [article today](http://www.businessinsider.com/liberals-can-win-if-they-stop-being-so-annoying-2017-7) encapsulates this article. A main idea of this theory is that large swaths of the country are rebelling against ""coastal elites"" and the associated liberal culture. 

I'm sure there are other arguments out there, including a mix of those offered above and completely different ideas.

>Dwayne Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!

The comparison is already being made to Trump's ""appreciate the congrats"" tweet after the Orlando shooting, which seemed to hurt him among many voters for the way he seemed callous in response to tragedy. 

This joins Trump's week and change of reaching out to the black community in ways that have caused as much trouble for him as they've helped. Media outlets noted that his outreach to blacks happened in white neighborhoods and to white crowds. His ""What do you have to lose?"" comment seemed to many to be essentially negging the black community, and some raised objections at the dismal view of black America he claimed. 

The whole attempt of Trump to look better on the issue of race has also opened up a Clinton attack on him—Clinton made her speech linking him to the alt-right, and released ads showing KKK members and other white nationalists endorsing his candidacy. 

Trump has a real problem with African American voters. To [quote Larry Sabato] (https://twitter.com/LarrySabato/status/767474591979671552): 

>Trump polls 1-2% among blacks. In '64 Goldwater got 6% after voting no on the Civil Rights Act. In '68 segregationist George Wallace won 3%.

1) Is there still an upside to Trump trying to fix his campaign's image on race? Have his attempts made things worse? 

2) How could Trump more effectively make outreach towards the black community?

EDIT: Yes, I get it. Trump is not trying to get AA to vote for him as much as get white moderates to not think he's racist. I tried to express that in the original post but I guess I wasn't clear enough.

When the public approves of the job the president is doing, the results are either only slight losses for his party or even net gains.

In Clinton's first and GW Bush's second, their parties were hit hard, losing both chambers on Congress. Both Obama and Trump similarly were unpopular and were ""shellacked"" in their first midterms.

Since Biden is also significantly underwater in job approval it is expected that the Democrats will at least lose the House, regardless of any impact the Supreme Court ruling on abortion in Dobbs.

From the Associated Press article:


Quick Summary: 

>Democrats approved a draft of the party platform early Saturday that includes steps to break up large Wall Street banks, advocates for a $15 an hour wage and urges the abolition of the death penalty

Defeated Sanders measures:

>Supporters of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated measures pushed by Sanders' allies that would have promoted a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system, a carbon tax to address climate change and impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracking.

Two quoted Sanders supporters' reactions:

>""We lost some but we won some,"" said James Zogby, a Sanders supporter on the panel. ""We got some great stuff in the platform that has never been in there before."" Added Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Sanders ally: ""We've made some substantial moves forward.""

**A very important thing to consider while analyzing this release:**

>The platform is a statement of the party's values and positions on a wide range of issues. While it does not bind the Democratic nominee to specific policies, it serves as a guidepost for the party moving forward.

Israeli-Palestinian Conflict:

>The committee defeated an amendment led by Zogby that would have called for providing Palestinians with ""an end to occupation and illegal settlements"" and urged an international effort to rebuild Gaza.

>The draft reflects Clinton's views and advocates working toward a ""two-state solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict"" that guarantees Israel's security with recognized borders ""and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity.""

Vague reference to Social Security:

>The document calls for the expansion of Social Security

The $15 minimum wage:

>referring to the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a ""starvation wage""

>Sanders' allies wanted the draft to specify that a $15 per hour minimum wage should be indexed with inflation. Clinton's side struck down that idea, noting the document included a call to ""raise and index the minimum wage.""

Breaking up big banks:

>supports ways to prevent banks from gambling with taxpayers' bank deposits, ""including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall."" Sanders wants to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Clinton does not, but says her proposed financial changes would cast a wider net by regulating the banking system.

The death penalty:

>a call for the abolition of the death penalty

The TPP:

>the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP

Sanders' reaction:

>Sanders, in a statement, said he was ""disappointed and dismayed"" that the group voted down the measure opposing the TPP. But he was pleased with the proposals on Glass-Steagall and the death penalty - and vowed to fight on. ""Our job is to pass the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,"" he said.

That's everything laid out in the Associated Press article, so some very big questions arise:

1) How much did Sanders' platform and movement affect this draft? It seems there are some very clear compromises.

2) How will these compromises affect the centrists and far left that she's trying to court? Will the demographic (all and any of them) of her support change?

3) Do you think this is the kind of thing the party needed to do to get Sanders' endorsement as he outlined it yesterday?

4) What does this mean going forward going for the Democratic party? As in, there are some truly progressive measures and not so progressive measures in this draft, do you think this trend will continue and how?

5) How will this affect voters when contrasted with Trump's extremism? Is this the kind of balance and pragmatism that Clinton has been vigorously advocating for herself?

* The official livestream will be [here](https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/). It will also be available on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/demconvention), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/demconvention), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/demconvention) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/demconvention).

* ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will air the convention from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. each night. C-SPAN, CNN, MSNBC and PBS will cover the full two hours each night.

**Speakers:**


* Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee and former secretary of state. Four years ago, she appeared onscreen to the sound of breaking glass before being nominated herself. This time, she will be speaking on behalf of the man she hopes can beat Mr. Trump where she could not.

* Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, the nominal home of the convention. He narrowly defeated Scott Walker, the Republican incumbent, for the governorship in 2018, two years after Mr. Trump won the state.

* Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Almost killed in a mass shooting in 2011, she has since become one of the United States’ most vocal advocates for stricter gun laws, and her husband, Mark Kelly, is the Democratic candidate for Senate in Arizona.

* Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate. She is the first woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket and will be looking to energize Black voters, the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituency.

* Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. She is the first Latina Democrat to lead any state and was a vice-presidential contender, and like several other governors, she received some national attention for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.

* Former President Barack Obama. More than anyone else in the Democratic Party, he is seen as a potential uniter of the party’s moderate and progressive factions. He did not weigh in publicly while the primary was competitive, but he has become more active on the campaign trail (or what remains of it) since endorsing Mr. Biden in April.

* Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She has been on the front lines of the ongoing legislative fights with the Trump administration over coronavirus relief and funding for the United States Postal Service.

* Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She and Senator Bernie Sanders, who spoke on Monday, were the two most prominent progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, and she was on Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential shortlist.

Already one candidate in 2020 has adopted it as his main message (Andrew Yang), but several other Democrats have seemed skeptical. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez replied on Twitter that UBI  ""is still being hashed out on a macroeconomic level, I believe."" 

Hillary Clinton flirted with the idea which she talked about in page 239 of What Happened: ""I was fascinated by this idea, as was my husband, and we spent weeks working with our policy team to see if it could be viable enough to include in my campaign. We would call it “Alaska for America.” Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work. To provide a meaningful dividend each year to every citizen, you’d have to raise enormous sums of money, and that would either mean a lot of new taxes or cannibalizing other important programs. We decided it was exciting but not realistic, and left it on the shelf.""

&#x200B;

Should UBI be added on to the already left-ward shift in policies that Dems will be pushing in 2020? Will UBI be an out-of-the-blue issue like Medicare-for-All was in 2016? UBI seems to have worked in Alaska which has a smaller economy than the nation as a whole, but then again if it sounded too utopian for the centrist Hillary campaign it might not have a broad national appeal.

In 2013, [he made similar comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4lFrk4PbVg), saying that Hillary's record as Secretary of State was ""above and beyond everybody else and EVERYTHING else."" 

In 2008, Trump [gave an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbm3ZmoF-6k), gushing about how intelligent his ""great friends"" Hillary and Bill Clinton were, and lamenting that Hillary's reputation as a tough politician leads people to overlook what a genuinely good person she is.

He [wrote a blog post in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20100217214811/http://www.trumpuniversity.com/blog/post/2008/03/the-race-for-vicepresident.cfm) encouraging Obama to pick Hillary as VP.

He specifically calls out Trump (and Pence) and the Republicans not just in the title, but all throughout the piece, making a forceful case against them. 

What he does *not* do, even once, is make a case against or even mention the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. He mentions the Democratic party only three times, once in discussing the country's political history, and twice in mentioning that he and running mate Bill Weld were Republican governors of strongly Democratic states. 

There are two questions here that I'd like to open for discussion.

1) What is Johnson's reason for doing this? He is - very forcefully - making the case against *one* of the two major candidates for President. Is he simply hoping to play spoiler? Johnson, being a pragmatic man, surely knows that it's nearly impossible for him to win the presidency, and that he has the potential to play an odd sort of kingmaker if he so chooses. 

(Corollary: Which candidate actually might benefit more? One would think that it would hurt Trump, but it might also take anti-Trump votes away from Hillary Clinton)

2) Is this a smart strategy for the Libertarian party to try asserting itself on a national stage? That is to say, targeting the base of one of the parties and trying to specifically pull support from it.  ",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

However, is that strategy working, and more importantly, is it going to work going forward, now that Trump's new campaign managers seems to have adopted a more moderate approach for the Republican candidate? (Moderate for him, at least.)

RCP shows that Clinton's aggregate polling lead [has shrunk from 7.9 points to 5.3 points](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) (-2.6) over the past week and a half.  

As for the rolling average polls which are more attuned to daily events,  LA Times has Clinton down 6 points over the course of the last week from a 4 point lead to a 2 point deficit today.  Reuters/Ipsos most recent poll, however,  does buck this trend by showing a 2 point bump for Clinton.

Some of this tightening up in the polls is undoubtedly the post-convention bounce finally starting to come to earth a bit.  However, I would posit that some of the movement in the LA Times polls could be an indication that his more scripted, less impulsive Twitter-driven approach is working to at least draw a few undecideds - particularly among Republican women who have previously refused to back him.  

Therefore, can Clinton quietly sit back and continue to rely on her strategy of letting Trump ""step in it"" repeatedly?  Or, alternatively, should she start to raise her profile this week, and get out in front of any momentum Trump's ""new campaign"" might start to generate?  If so, how can she do this?

The nationalized race has therefore been described as a proxy battle between the ""progressive"" and the ""moderate"" wings of the Democratic Party. 

As polls closed, it became apparent that Shontel Brown had come from a one-time 35 points deficit to defeat Nina Turner to become, in all likelihood, the next Congresswoman for OH-11. Given the nationalized nature of the race, how does this result bode for the future direction of the party?

People randomly yelling out agreements and trying to start chants and pumping their arms over political ideas. Strangers walking up to me asking what values matter to me and trying to create this super personal and intimate conversation. I honestly couldn’t understand the behavior I was watching- why were they being so intense? Were the behaviors so fake that they appeared real or so real that they appeared fake? The effect of all this was to make me feel the most intense and prolonged feeling of social anxiety that has ever occurred to me. I apologize if this submission isn't following a really organized progression but I seriously feel all jacked up right now coming back from this thing.

Having always been a student (currently in grad school), the behavior that is most natural for me while watching a speaker is to watch quietly and attentively and seeing everyone going nuts made me SUPER confused and unsure of which behaviors I should, or even wanted, to display.

Completely aside from anything related to the content of her speech whatsoever (it could have been the rally for any candidate) I cannot believe that these coordinated hysterical mobs are how political action attempts to appear to occur and cannot imagine how people could come to be convinced to change some belief hanging around in their head in such an environment.

>Because I have not heard her say the things that I think needs to be said.

When asked what it would take for him to throw his support behind her, he laid out three positions she'd have to consider/adopt in order for that to happen:

>I want her to say among other things, we have a crisis in higher education -- public universities and colleges should be tuition free. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I believe that healthcare should be a right of all people. I would love her to say that and I would love her to move aggressively to make that happen.

So naturally he was then asked about the meetings they've been having recently, and affirmed they're still going well, but still leaves it open:

>We're talking. I would hope that that would happen or it may not happen. It's not just me. Charlie, what this campaign has been about is people wanting to transform America.

This makes it sound like he's still holding onto the ""take it to the convention to shift the platform"" narrative, do you think this is a signal he's still not done yet? How will BoBs react to the fact he's still trying to push their agenda, despite the fact he'll vote for her? Here's Sanders take:

>It's not a question for me. We got 13 million votes, we got in virtually every primary and caucus the vast majority of young people - people 45 years of age or younger, and what those voters are saying to the establishment, to Secretary Clinton -- 'Hey are you gonna stand up for us?

Big questions arise from the specifics needed for Clinton to get his support: Will she be able to adopt them and still appeal to centrists essential to winning an election? Do you think she needs to adopt them in order to win the rest of Bernie's supporters? Most importantly, IMO, were she to adopt these policies and he ends up endorsing her, would that make it more likely for BoBs to vote Hillary and subsequently give her a bumb? Or would the policies alienate more people than she gains by moving left?

* **Not Dodging Questions**: I thought the question about ""would you apologize to Sandy Hook victims?"" was a super loaded and unfair question. But Bernie took it head on, and answered it clearly and straightforwardly. Again, that took a lot of political courage.

* **Did Not Look Smug**: Bernie had much more vocal crowd support during the debate. When his name was getting chanted he looked appreciative and humble, but not smug. That was pretty damn classy.

* **Supports Party Unity**: During the post debate interview, Bernie said that he didn't know any Democrat who wouldn't support either him or Hillary in the general election, thus implying that he will fully support Hillary if/when the time comes.

He's previously questioned Obama's citizenship, raised questions about vaccines, and accused Ted Cruz's father of being involved in the assassination of JFK. He's repeatedly claimed that the Democratic primaries were rigged in Clinton's favor and that the general election will be too. 

On the other end of the spectrum I've seen some liberals accuse Trump of being a plant by Hillary to make herself look better. It seems like the far left and far right both love to bring up decades worth of Clinton conspiracies.

Even Hillary supporters are not immune. Quite a few of them have been accusing Trump of being a puppet for Putin. As in, the Russian government is directly giving Trump or Paul Manafort marching orders. 

Has American distrust of the government led to a state of suspicion and paranoia where these types of conspiracies flourish? Is the media complicit by giving both sides of every argument equal airtime rather than calling out lies and unproven claims?

> Bernie Sanders predicted Monday that the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia could be ""messy"" as he pushed the party to adopt his progressive agenda, but added, ""Democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle.""

This seems quite ominous to me. It sounds more and more like Bernie will go to the Convention fighting. But what could that possibly accomplish? What does he really think he can get at the Convention?

1) If he is sincere about stopping Trump from the nomination, he has got to know that disrupting the Convention with a divisive floor fight isn't the way to go. Perhaps he feels justified because he does not believe Clinton can defeat Trump, and believes that he will have to be the nominee in order for the Left to win. But it seems virtually impossible that he could win a majority of pledged delegates. 

The nomination is no longer a realistic possibility for him, unless the superdelegates overturn the popular vote for him. If he won the nomination in this way somehow, could he possibly still be viable for November?

2) Alternatively, he may be seeking to influence the party platform. But why? The platform is, by all accounts, rather irrelevant. And regardless, he has a minority of pledged delegates. Simple mathematics would indicate that he cannot win a floor fight on any truly controversial issues. Which seems to be few and far in between anyway. Sanders platform, as far as I can tell, don't really disagree with Hillary's except in degrees and methods.

What might he hope to ask for at the Convention, that could be worth the effort to him? Does the platform really have any importance to justify this?

3) The other possibility I can think of is that he wishes to participate in a third party run, either independently or with the Green Party. But a third party run would certainly ensure a Trump presidency, and it doesn't seem credible that Bernie will be willing to go that far.  He could perhaps uses that possibility to threaten the Democrats into conceding to his demands, but such a divisive tactic seem to me like it would help ensure a Trump victory in November.

Is this a realistic strategy for him to pursue?

1.) Launch national campaign to get states to expand Medicaid.  
  
2.) Allow eligible families to buy on the exchanges, regardless of immigration status.  
  
3.) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to block or modify unreasonable health insurance premium rate increases.  
  
4.) She has already laid out plans to address drug costs and increasing out-of-pocket expenses. 
  
5.) Public Option  
  
6.) Expand Medicare by allowing people 55 years to buy in.  
  
7.) Expand funding to Federally Qualified Health Centers to $40 Billion over 10 years.  
  
8.) Supports President Obama’s call for a near tripling of the size of the National Health Service Corps . 
  
  
I like a lot of these idea. She incorporated a few Sanders proposals. Some things that stand out:   
  
1.) If she managed to bring back the public option would be huge. 
  
2.) Expand Medicare to 55, I like this idea. Medicare beneficiaries that opt in would pay the premium. However, at 55 you're still a fairly healthy adult with few chronic conditions/illness. 
  
3.) Not sure how much industry will like government controlled rate regulation. I can't imagine that would pass.  
  
4.) $$$ for FQHC's, this is an amazing and much needed investment all things considering. I think this would have strong bipartisan support. The federal government would be directing a major influx of funding to community clinics for prevention. I want this to happen ASAP. 
  
5.) I think illegal immigrants should be able to purchase on the exchanges, however, they shouldn't be eligible for subsidies. I don't think this will pass though, unless the Democrats get a favorable immigration bill.

Or was Sanders not as strong as we previously thought in one of the most liberal parts of California? Or is this poll not accurately reflecting reality? Or is there something else we're missing in the analysis?

Why? The data and exit polls are showing that the progressive wing of the party was largely unreliable with the strongest example being that Clinton outperformed Feingold (a progressive) in Wisconsin. Progressives have proven to be a small portion of a party that will need to rebuild their ""big tent"" since black, latino, and college educated whites (the coalition that would be needed to beat Trump) largely slant towards the centre.

Furthermore, due to the dynamics of the positions the majority in Congress hold it seems far more likely that the prevailing position against Trump's populism won't come from the populist left but from the centre as the Chamber of Commerce and foreign policy consensus Republicans attempt to reign in Trump with some expected aid in that coming from moderate Dems.

From what I can gather the Dems need a Blair-like figure (charismatic but centrist) rather than Sanders or Warren.

In 2008, for the first time in a very long time, it voted for Barack Obama by a 6 point margin, and he carried it again in 2012 by 4 points. Clinton's RCP average over Trump in Virginia as of right now is over 11 points, and it was one of the few states where Rubio nearly beat Trump.

What is the reason for this? My take is that Virginia republicans are very different than republicans from more conservative states. In Virginia, many tend to live in the Fairfax/DC metro area and are fiscally conservative for tax and spending reasons, but are socially liberal. They tend to be high income and high education, and I think the increasing ""low brow"" base of the GOP turns them off - especially Trump.

I feel like Virginia represents the inability for the GOP to win the presidency. Until they can win this state again, I don't think they can win nationally for two reasons. 1 - Electorally, they NEED Virginia in order to win. Without it, the path narrows significantly and even with OH and FL they would need to win 2/3 western swing states (NV, NM, and CO), which is difficult as hispanics grow in number and are turned off by the GOP. 2 - It represents the inability to win those moderate, suburban Republicans. If they can't win Virginia, they aren't winning them elsewhere either and its hard to see how they can lose this area and make it up elsewhere.

*One poll from August 2015, definitely not reliable.

I am not going to make this a conversation about whether or not the polls are accurate/reliable after the Michigan polling debacle because we really don't have a conclusively way of knowing. However I do find it unlikely that Michigan will repeat itself considering it was an unprecedented and historic polling error.

I have heard from many supporters of Sanders that after March 15th states start to look favorable to Bernie since the south is over. So to see how important March 15th is, we need to look ahead on the calendar: 



Date | State | Delegates | Type | Current Polls

 | Idaho | 23 | Open Caucus | [Sanders +2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/id/idaho_democratic_presidential_caucus-5801.html)

 | **Total** | **620** |  | 

Please note that polling for these states is pretty weak considering some of the polls are old and only a few have been done.

So now if you compare the two tables you will see that March 15th has more delegates at stake than the following 9 states combined. I know the polling is weak but I am not seeing where the Bernie friendly states are coming from based on the polls coming out of New York and Arizona. 

Let's do a little more math now. From a Sanders perspective, I am going to be optimistic in this scenario:

* Bernie over-performs March 15th and manages to walk away with 45% of the delegates
* Over the course of the next month Bernie gains momentum and is able to make up for all of the delegates Hillary gained on March 15th. In the 14 states listed above Clinton takes 655 delegates, Sanders 656
* Going into April 26 the delegate totals stand at Clinton: 1,427; Sanders: 1,205 (the same spread as of now not counting Super Delegates)
* The target delegate amount to secure nomination is 2,026. Clinton would need 599 delegates to secure the nomination and Sanders would need 821 out of 1,413 total remaining delegates.
* This would mean that Sanders would need 58% of all of the available delegates post April 19th.

**Conclusion:** In this super friendly scenario to Sanders, he still loses the nomination pretty easily unless he can swing massive (20+ point) wins in California, NJ, and basically every state post April 19th. 

To even have a chance at the nomination, it looks like Sanders can't just over-perform on March 15th. He needs to win about 381 of the 691 delegates or 55%. If that happens then I will be a believer in his chances to win.

**I'm hoping this doesn't come off as an anti-Sanders, pro-Hillary shitpost. I just wanted to look at the numbers as objectively as I could and do a bit of low level analysis. Also if any of my math or delegate totals are wrong please let me know!*

**EDIT:**

Questions/Points of Discussion:

* What result will Bernie need to achieve on Tuesday for your opinion to swing in his favor (in terms of being the favorite)?
* Do you think NY and California being so late in the nomination calendar have helped or hurt Bernie?
* What current pro-Hillary states are most likely to swing to Bernie's favor?

Many articles have come out recently discussing how African Americans are more supportive for moderate/conservative/establishment democrats over progressives like Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Daniel Bliss, and Cynthia Nixon. In Polls between Cynthia Nixon and Incumbent New York Governor Cuomo, Nixon polls very poorly with African Americans. Similarly, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won an upset primary election against Rep Joe Crowley, she had a poor showing in African American communities. Illinois Gubernatorial candidate Daniel Bliss also struggled in part because of low African American support.

""In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, could never quite overcome Hillary Clinton's connection with black voters."" Clinton swept the south in the 2016 primaries and Sanders constantly  struggled African American support during the primary. 

Rep. Cedric Richmond aka the head of the Congressional Black Caucus said: ""Bernie is fighting for his principles on what direction the party should go but we don't really have anybody doing it on behalf of moderates and other Democrats. It has become a one-sided conversation.""

More right wing candidates will win the primary. In the 2022 midterms, we saw that the more right wing candidates lost in battleground states. If this is reflected in a presidential race, that it is very difficult for a right wing  GOP nominee to win in key states. The candidate must be able to win over conservatives and moderates.

From history, we can see that this matters. From 1968 to 1992, the Democrats controlled the president for 4 out of 24 years. The 1976 win was extremely lucky due to the Watergate scandal and Ford pardoning Nixon. Carter barely managed to beat Ford. 1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988 were Republican landslides. The candidates such as George McGovern was too far to the left for the American public. Mondale and Dukakis were fairly liberal as well. Carter lost due to his mismanagement of the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis. It was only until the Democrats embraced centrism then they had a chance of winning. Bill Clinton was a moderate.

It seems that unless the GOP nominate a moderate then swing voters will vote for the Democratic candidate. The only way a right wing candidate can win is if the Democrats nominate a far left candidate or if the Democrats mismanage the economy.

Trump’s win in 2016 was an aberration. He was unknown at the time and rode on a populist wave. Moderates in swing states disliked Clinton and were willing to give Trump a chance. The moderates turned against him in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections as they were disdained at his behaviour.

But she is very similar and therefore unlikely to attract a large new crowd. Also she is pretty old too. It would be a “Mama Warren and Papa Sanders” White House to phrase it in an SNL way.
* **Tulsi Gabbard** \- She is younger, considered to be almost as much, if not more to the left than Bernie Sanders. According to [a YouTuber called The New Left](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdF8d_2vXsMh9IsMBSblQYg), who I find a bit too ""conspiracy theory-like"" and extreme, although sometimes he makes valid point; he says that Tulsi Gabbart is only doing what she is doing because she knows she won't be declared a real democrat by the DNC and she is pushing the extreme ideas of Bernie and then will end up as his VP candidate. Although her right-wing background might fire back at her. She is also the one that he seems to describe.
* **Richard Ojeda** \- He is not from ""another gender"" as I quote from Sanders and that might make him invalid according to his standards. Important things that Richard Ojeda brings is that he can speak to republicans. He brought up the biggest point difference the 2018 election. Trump had to go down twice to prevent Ojeda from winning his seat. He is also a veteran and can turn over some old fashioned red states.
* **Pete Buttigieg** \- Again, he is not a woman. I never heard of him before, but [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe8dh-fctfg) stunned me. He is definitely younger than Bernie, a bit over half his age. He is relatively progressive and has an interesting agenda. He is a popular democratic mayor in *fricking* Mike Pence's home state, Indiana. His name recognition is low though, but he can be useful in foreign policy in my opinion.

These are my top picks, but I might be totally off. Here are some candidates I think he would definitely not pick:

* ***Kamala Harris*** \- She is in my opinion and according to many others a reboot of Hillary Clinton. She has a controversial background and she is too close to the DNC and has a lot of Wall Street money as far as I know. I think if Bernie were the candidate, ""traditional"" democrats would still turn out and vote Bernie, but they would only be active supporters if Kamala Harris turns out to be the running mate.
* ***Joe Biden*** \- Some say that his name recognition would bring a lot to Bernie, and that is true. To be honest, I find it unlikely that Bernie would ask him, and it would more be a humiliation to him to be picked as VP if he loses the nomination (if he even runs). So even if Bernie were to pick him, he would probably turn it down himself.",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

# What is the ""Great Wall Of Bernie"" and what does it predict?

In [July 2015](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/), Nate Silver predicted that Bernie could win Iowa and New Hampshire yet still lose everywhere else. To demonstrate why, he looked at 2008 exit polls showing which states had the most Democrats self-identifying as Liberal and/or White. The top three states were Iowa, New Hampshire and Vermont. 

###[**The ""Great Wall of Bernie"" Chart**](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/silver-datalab-bernieland.png)

Nate predicted that if Sanders did not win Iowa and New Hampshire in landslides, that could foreshadow crushing losses for him in the more ""diverse"" and politically moderate areas of the country, unless he could win more of the minority vote.

Now that Iowa and New Hampshire have voted, we can begin testing Nate's thesis.

# How can we transfer the IA/NH results to the nationwide White electorate to estimate Sanders' final White vote?

Let's imagine a gymnasium filled with **1000 typical 2008 Democratic Primary voters.** 

Now, [about **650 of them are White**](http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf) (and 358 of those White voters support Clinton '08). We don't have any solid info about non-Whites yet, but we can start to tell what those 650 White voters would think of Bernie.

I'm going to use multiple methods to estimate Sanders' current White support ***nationwide*** based on the *characteristics* of his White supporters as seen in the 2 states that have voted so far. [Let's break it down!](http://media2.giphy.com/media/kgKrO1A3JbWTK/giphy.gif)

- **AGE** How old are our 650 White voters from 2008? We know that seventy are under 30. Sanders won 84% of White under-30s in the early states, so we'll give him fifty-nine of these voters. Similarly, 130 of the Whites in our gym are over 65 - Sanders is averaging just 35% with these voters, so we'll give him 45 supporters here. And the remaining 450 Whites in our gym are middle aged. Sanders so far has averaged just about half of these voters - we'll give him 225 supporters. So according to the age breakdown, Sanders should have **329 White supporters**.

- **EDUCATION** I'll spare you the math, but based on a similar breakdown of White college grads vs. non-grads, we can estimate Sanders has **354 White supporters** in the gym (he does best among non-grads).

- **INCOME** And a similar breakdown of income estimates his support at **348 White fans** (he does best among those with lower family incomes).

- **POPULAR VOTE** Sanders has won 59% of the popular vote so far. Imagining that *""roughly"" all* these IA and NH voters have been White, we can translate that ratio to **385 White supporters** in our gym. This highball figure represents the fact that many more people voted in NH than IA, and Sanders of course did better in NH. If you believe Sanders benefited from being a native of next-door VT, discount this estimate.

The long story short is that we can see Bernie has something like **345** White supporters in the ""2008 gym"" which leaves 305 White supporters for Clinton. So Bernie is doing much better than Obama (or Clinton '16 is doing worse than Clinton '08) with White voters. Of course, 345 is not 500. Bernie needs 155 non-White supporters to form a majority coalition. With some quick math, we can get a % figure:

##*Bernie needs to win about* ***44.3%*** *of Democratic non-White voters!*

**It is difficult to overstate how terrible this projected goal is for Sanders.** In most polls his support among Democratic non-Whites is nowhere near this figure. For example, [in a recent post-Iowa poll](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/109083/20160115/presidential-election-poll-2016-hillary-clinton-has-strong-lead-among-black-latino-voters-sanders-winning-white-vote.htm) his nationwide support registered at 20% among Blacks and 33% among Latinos - higher than the summer and fall of 2015, but nowhere near that 44% figure. By contrast, Obama ended up winning 82% of Blacks and 35% of Latinos.

So we might say, case closed, Bernie Sanders has an insurmountable Black People Problem.

#But what if there is unexpected good news for Sanders? Does the 2016 Democratic gym look different than 2008?

To understand how the Democratic electorate is possibly changing, let's compare [the exit polls for the first two states in 2008](http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf) to the [Iowa](http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/iowa/exit/) and [New Hampshire](http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/new-hampshire/exit/) exits in 2016.

- **SLIGHTLY LESS WHITE** Whites went from 93% of the vote in IA '08 to  91% in 2016. Similarly, NH dropped from 95% to 93% White. Projected across the nation, that's bad news for Sanders - he'd need to do even better among non-Whites to make up the difference.

- **NO TIDAL WAVE OF (WHITE) WOMEN** The New Hampshire primary went from 55% to 57% women, while Iowa held steady at 57% in both years. The lack of a ""women wave"" is pretty good news for Sanders considering he does about 10 points better among (White) men than women.

- **THE (WHITE) YOUTH AREN'T YUUUGE** Under-30s declined from 22% to 18% of the Iowa electorate and in New Hampshire they increased from 18% to 19%. Meanwhile, seniors increased from 22% to 28% in Iowa and 13% to 17% in New Hampshire. This is terrible news for the Revolution. Simply put, age might be the best predictor of affiliation among White voters. Seniors were the only cohort Clinton actually won in NH.

- **WHITES ARE MORE EDUCATED AND LEFTIST THAN EIGHT YEARS AGO.** Last time, 56% of NH voters identified themselves as Liberals. This time, IA and NH both identified as almost 70% Liberal. Income distributions & partisan ID stayed about the same, but college graduation rates also soared (grads went from 46% to 60% of the NH electorate).

Mostly, we're seeing small demographic changes compared to eight years ago. The big movers are Liberalness and educational attainment.

#The 2016 White Democrats are MUCH more educated and MUCH more Liberal than the White Democrats of 2008. Could that be bad news for Clinton?

An interesting pattern arises when we look at how Liberals and Moderates voted in 2008. When the state was diverse (e.g. Alabama, Texas, New Jersey) Obama and Clinton each had broad ideological coalitions: they each did about equally well among Liberals *and* among Moderates, with Hillary's vote perhaps being a little Moderate-heavy. But **the Whiter the state, the more Obama leaned on Liberals and Hillary's coalition tilted Moderate.** In Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin and several other ""very White"" states, Obama outperformed Hillary among Liberals significantly whether he won or lost the state.

Simply put, White Liberals just didn't like Hillary in 2008. And that hasn't changed. The more Liberal the White part of the electorate has become, the worse that is for Hillary Clinton.

What about education? Clinton beat Obama 62-31 among White non-graduates, while only tying 48-47 among White graduates. That might make it seem like a flood of college grads is bad news for Clinton. But this year **that pattern has flipped.** Among White people, Bernie performs best with those who haven't graduated college. The more graduates, the better off Clinton will be, it seems.

So the increasing Liberalness of the White Democrats is bad news for Clinton, but their increasing educational attainment is good news for her - at least with Bernie as an opponent.

# What final conclusions can we draw? Iowa and New Hampshire have given us a glimpse of what White voters think about Sanders and Clinton, as well as how White voters have changed from 2008 to 2016.

1. There will be many more White Liberals this year than 2008. That's the best part of the news for Sanders. 

2. The bad news is young White voters aren't turning out as much as they did last time - and White seniors are turning out more. Sanders would much rather have it the other way around.

3. We also know that Sanders does better among Whites who haven't graduated college. But White voters are more educated now than in '08.

4. Finally, it may be too soon to tell but looks as though Whites will be *slightly* less of the Democratic electorate overall. Obviously, that increases the importance of doing well with non-Whites. 

Depending on how you weigh these four factors (**liberalness, age, education, and overall turnout**), Sanders could do worse or better than our ""gym estimates"" based on the characteristics of 2008's White voters.

We'll know more about White voters after the more politically moderate ones in South Carolina cast their ballots. We'll also start to know hard facts about how non White voters are deciding.

However, the basic math seems to remain pretty unchanged:

###Sanders needs to do significantly better with non-White voters than the polls currently estimate for him to have a chance of becoming the nominee.",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

Can Trump really win the presidency by simply doing better than Romney among white male voters without college degrees? Especially with hearing after the last losses that the Republicans need to win more support among minorities to have a better chance in future presidential races, with targeting the Latino vote seemingly the answer, this would be quite an unexpected path to the presidency I think

Should Clinton address this in her campaign, trying to win over some of these voters? Or do you think there isn't really a chance Trump can win the presidency with him not doing better than Romney in any group but the male voters without college degrees? ",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

By that, I mean that if there was a Senate election in a state, whatever party won the Senate race also won that state's presidential electors; all Republican-elected Senator's home-states voted for Donald Trump, while all Democratic-elected Senator's home-states voted for Hillary Clinton. Before this, in every presidential cycle, there was at least one state that split by voting in a Senator from one party and a Presidential Candidate from the other. Many point to this as proof that 2016 voters were largely down-ballot voters, and picked all Democrats or all Republicans.

What can we expect in 2020? Most Senate Republicans are now distancing themselves from the President, but before the pandemic were largely very close to him. Are there any states that will vote in a Republican senator and also for Joe Biden? Will Donald Trump carry any states that Democrats will flip the Senate seat?

The main rationale I see expressed is that a Republican controlled Congress will effectively freeze Biden’s presidency and render him and the Democrats unable to pass meaningful legislation. Which, given how they have been criticised relentlessly over worsening inflation and a sentiment of “do-nothingness” can prove fatal.

However, I often hear that midterms are not a very reliable barometer for how the presidential general election will go. It’s been cited that Reagan, Clinton and Obama suffered massive midterm losses and still managed to win re-election. And that it is still far too early to make any predictions in confidence on whether the Dems lose 2024. 

As such, can the results of the 2022 midterms, particularly if its a big Republican victory, be reliably interpreted as foreshadowing the eventual result of the 2024 presidential race?",PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton

Personally, looking at the results, the reason we lost was not a Trump wave but a failed Clinton campaign. Trump underperformed Romney and McCain in Wisconsin and other states. He did not win, Clinton lost. We do not need major platform changes, just major candidate changes. We need to not give the nom to the heir apparent but to whoever has the will of the people. 

I also think, to some extent, we can rely on an anti-Trump wave in the next two elections, however, we need to capitalize on it.

Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

21,Megathread: U.S. Intelligence Told Lawmakers of Russian Strategy to Boost Trump Re-Election,56708.0,f72zp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f72zp5/megathread_us_intelligence_told_lawmakers_of/,7710.0,1582246088.0,"Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.

The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.

During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.

That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.

23,"Megathread: AG Barr, Gaetz, AOC, others call for investigation into the death of Jeffery Epstein",55491.0,col282,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/col282/megathread_ag_barr_gaetz_aoc_others_call_for/,14890.0,1565458682.0,"Several members of Congress are calling for investigations following the apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who faced federal sex trafficking charges before his death.

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, called Epstein's suicide an 'impossibility' that needed further congressional investigation.

'When an impossibility occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation,' Green wrote. 'Because the public has a right to know, I’m calling for a congressional investigation.'

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voiced concern about Epstein's death.

'We need answers. Lots of them,' she wrote on Twitter. She then retweeted a post from former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, in which Mariotti says that the criminal probe into Epstein would conclude because 'no one else was charged in the indictment.'

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called on the Bureau of Prisons to 'provide answers on what systemic failures of the MCC Manhattan or criminal acts allowed this coward to deny justice to his victims.'

Attorney General William Barr on Saturday decried the death of wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody while he awaited charges on sex trafficking, saying the apparent suicide 'raises serious questions.'

'I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered,' Barr said in a statement.

'In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death,' Barr added.

Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.

Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on ""Bloody Sunday,"" Lewis decisively carved a place for himself in the history books as a courageous young activist during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 

He was elected to Congress in 1986 and served 17 terms representing an Atlanta-area district.

Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault before the committee on Monday for extraordinary public hearings just weeks before the midterm elections.

Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, told reporters Monday afternoon that the chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, told senators there would be an “opportunity” for senators to hear from Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, in a public setting where senators would be able to ask questions. Both have said they are willing to testify. A Senate Republican aide confirmed that it would be on Monday, effectively delaying a planned committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, which had been scheduled for this Thursday.

And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong **without** either isolating ourselves or **trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.**

>I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is **political hot air.** Well, **so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It’s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.** Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin. 


-Barack Obama

>CLINTON: Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, **we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.**

-Hillary Clinton

#Clinton supports the same policies that led to the vacuums of power in the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS and ENDLESS WAR. 

When Hillary Clinton says things like this and wants to focus on taking out Assad and creating a power vacuum in the middle east before taking out ISIS she sounds insane. These aren't liberal or progressive positions. When Clinton says these things she is disagreeing with nearly every democratic president before her. **Is it not clear that she is working for other interests?**

>SANDERS: I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war.

>But I think -- and I say this with due respect -**that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.**

>**Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.**

>**But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS**

**Hillary Clinton also has no comprehensive tax plan and has no way to make her proposals fit into the budget anymore than Sanders does. Clinton's plan is to expand EVERYTHING and make cuts no where.** Sanders at least is realistic about his plans. We can eliminate medicare/medicaid/ss and replace them with universal healthcare and cut Military spending by 50% and still have the strongest military.

https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/charts/2015-charts/total-desk.svg
 
Clintons ""tax plan"" consists of a few tax rates and proposals to ""close tax loop holes"" but she doesn't state which ones. She doesn't state how her tax plan will directly pay for her health plan or expansion of the military or any of her other proposals. **Hillary Clinton has no math that shows how her plan will fit into the budget.** Literally all she has is a few tax percentages. That's not a plan.

Now let's break down her ""college plan"" which is not a real plan either:

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact-costs/

Where does it say how she'll pay for it? It's all non-speak. It's not a real plan because it's lacking details. Am I expected to go through every page on her site and add up every number?

>Clinton's New College Compact plan costs in the range of $350 billion over 10 years and will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate. 

What loopholes? What expenditures? There is no REAL information here, and this is exactly how Sanders wants to pay for his plan.  

>We need to make ambitious investments so that cost is no longer a barrier to college education, and the burden of debt does not hold back everyday Americans.

This is meaningless drivel. Is she seriously talking about betting tax money on more ""investments""?

>More than half of the total will go towards grants to states and colleges. 

Half of what??? Her ""investment"" This is scary! Her college plan is based on betting money.

>These grants will ensure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition and that support will also help reduce the burden of living expenses at 4-year public colleges. 

How? she doesn't know what the number will be.

>They will provide free tuition at community colleges, support private non-profit colleges that keep costs low and provide value, and relieve debt for students who commit to national service. 

Again: how? She's not really explaining where the money came from or how much it will be because she doesn't know.

>These new grants will be paired with holding states and colleges accountable for bringing down costs.

Ah, so she will place some of the burden on the states and colleges themselves, another unpredictable variable in Clintons wild ride.

>Around one-third of the funds will go toward relief on interest from student debt.

A third of what???!! This entirely depends on her ""investments"" paying off. Load of shit.

>This includes allowing every American with outstanding public debt to refinance their student loans at today's low interest rates, cutting interest rates to reflect the government’s cost of debt,

Exactly what Sanders wants to do.

>and making it far easier for students to enroll in income-based repayment that limits crushing debt.

Still don't know how, but okay...

>The remaining funds will support innovative new investments to create a higher education system for the 21st Century. That means new funds to expand new models of life-long learning, rewarding college completion and enrollment, and broadening support for student parents.

#Where is the comprehensive plan Hillary? Put up or shut up.

As of this date, March 3, 2022, Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, in much the same way as I have predicted here and elsewhere.  The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:

**********

After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",geopolitics,Clinton
1,Donald Trump threatens escalation of trade war with China: US President says tariffs will be ‘raised very substantially’ if no truce is reached,338.0,dvgm25,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dvgm25/donald_trump_threatens_escalation_of_trade_war/,99.0,1573593664.0,"https://www.ft.com/content/ef7d04c2-0576-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd

President Donald Trump threatened a new escalation of the trade war with China, saying US tariffs on Chinese goods would be “raised very substantially” if no truce was reached with officials in Beijing. 

Mr Trump’s comments at the Economic Club of New York highlight the trouble the US administration is having in its efforts to strike an interim deal with China that would bring a halt to the commercial conflict afflicting the world’s two largest economies. 

After Mr Trump announced that a tentative agreement had been secured in early October, US and Chinese officials have been haggling over the details, including where a deal would be signed and whether Washington would roll back existing levies as part of such a settlement.


Mr Trump said a “significant phase one deal with China” remained “close” and “could happen soon”, as Beijing was “dying to make a deal”. But he also warned that higher levies would follow if the talks faltered.

I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs

President Donald Trump on US trade talks with China
The US has placed 25 per cent tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and 15 per cent tariffs on a further $112bn of Chinese goods. It has threatened new 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese products in December. 

“I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs, they are going to be raised very substantially,” Mr Trump warned. 

Mr Trump used the speech in New York, his hometown, to defend his administration’s protectionist trade policies and his economic record ahead of next year’s presidential election campaign

He said his administration had “delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations” after nearly three years in office, but blamed the Federal Reserve for restraining growth under his watch. 

The president, who has frequently challenged the Fed’s independence by demanding easier monetary policy, said the US was at a “competitive disadvantage” because it had not followed the eurozone into the land of negative rates. 

“Give some of that money, I want some of that money,” he said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year, after raising them last year, but has since suggested it will pause easing for the time being. 

Mr Trump’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his presidency, on the eve of public impeachment hearings over the Ukraine scandal in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and less than a year from the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump wants to tout his economic prowess as a key selling point in the 2020 campaign, in a bid to hold on to the swing voters who propelled him to the White House in the race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. 

“We have ended the war on American workers, we have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Mr Trump said. 

Despite record highs in US stock markets, persistently low unemployment and strong consumption, there have been some warning signs for the US president about the health of the economy. The pace of growth has slowed throughout the year, with both agricultural producers and manufacturers in the American heartland bearing the brunt of the trade wars and weakening global output. 

This has exposed Mr Trump to criticism from Democrats that his policies have backfired, failing to live up to their promise of boosting the prospects of average middle-class households Despite all the pressure exerted through tariffs, the US administration has failed to secure any major concessions from China on the toughest trade issues like industrial subsidies and the theft of intellectual property. 

US agrees limited trade deal with China
Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank, said: “This laughable cheerleading in front of Wall Street pretty much sums up Trump’s economic agenda: no real results for the country at large, but delivering for the titans of Wall Street and corporate monopolies.”

Mr Trump’s more pugnacious, protectionist approach to trade has been a cornerstone of his economic agenda from the beginning of his presidency — and many businesses have complained that the uncertainty it created has frozen their investment plans.

But Mr Trump appeared to reject those claims. He said: “They were totally down. Now they’re a little bit down because a little bit, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars. But there is no uncertainty.”

As they await word on the US-China talks, investors and officials are also closely watching Mr Trump’s decision, expected this week, on whether to impose tariffs on car imports, after labelling them a threat to national security. Mr Trump did not mention the issue, which is a big risk to EU carmakers in particular, but the administration is expected to grant Brussels a new reprieve from the levies.",geopolitics,Clinton
2,Attended a speech given by Michael McFaul last night. He had a lot of great info and an interesting hypothesis about Putin,223.0,a3r2bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a3r2bg/attended_a_speech_given_by_michael_mcfaul_last/,76.0,1544123065.0,"He felt confident saying the Yeltsin and Clinton had a great relationship, and people felt as if the fall of the Soviet Union could lead to a successor state that is friendly to the US, much like what happened after the fall of the Japanese Empire and the Nazi Reich. He admitted that he wasn’t actually dictating US policy towards Russia at the time, so he admits that this is an unprofessional opinion.

He says that during Medvedev’s administration, the US-Russia relations were the best they had been in 70 years. He pointed to the fact that, when polled, Russians had overall positive opinions of Americans, and Americans had positive opinions of Russia. Russia also helped immensely with getting Iran to negotiate on the Iran deal.

Putin was disgusted by Medvedev fostering warm relations with the US, which is why he took the presidency back and immediately burned all the bridges that Medvedev built with Obama. 

The impression throughout the speech that I got is that Putin has been the main deterrent stopping cooperation between the US and Russian regime. Someone asked him later that, if Putin is to blame for the breakdown in relations, if a post-Putin Russia would try to restore relations. His response was that Putin’s successor will likely follow this “Putinism” ideology that treats the West the same way the USSR did.",geopolitics,Clinton
3,Analyzing America's recent Tomahawk strike on Syria,126.0,65a23x,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65a23x/analyzing_americas_recent_tomahawk_strike_on_syria/,48.0,1492137542.0,"Russia is claiming that ""only 23 out of 59"" Tomahawk's reached their destinations, while the U.S. military claims ""58 out of 59"" reached their intended destinations.

Russia provided no evidence of its claims. The highly-respected IHS Janes has [analyzed satellite imagery](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e59dSxYkcagJ:www.janes.com/article/69528/analysis-satellite-imagery-refutes-russian-claims-about-tomahawk-strike+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=safari) in the aftermath of the attack and concluded,  based upon damage assessment, that Moscow is lying about its claims.

A [highly-insightful article](https://jamestown.org/program/russian-air-defense-us-strike-al-shayrat/) sheds some more light on what Russian military specialists thought of the attack and summarizes their views:

> These systems are not principally designed to counter low-flying subsonic Tomahawks; their capacity to attempt this is limited to approximately 30–40 km. Colonel (retired) Mikhail Khodarenok, a defense correspondent for Gazeta.ru and an air defense specialist, notes **the Al-Shayrat airbase is located around 200 km from Latakia, which he suggests lies at the outer limit of the S-400 range: to strike a target at this range requires it to be flying at an altitude of 8–9 km. If it flies lower, the S-400’s multifunctional radar cannot see the cruise missile due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface. Similarly, the S-300V4 at Tartus has a range of around 100 km and requires a target altitude of 6–7 km. According to Air Force Colonel General (retired) Igor Maltsev, the former chief of the Main Staff in the Air Defense Troops, since Tomahawks fly at 50–60 meters above the ground, the outer effective range for the S-300V4 system would only be around 24–26 km in cross country terrain. Maltsev concluded that the S-400 and S-300V4 located in Latakia and Tartus did not have even a theoretical chance to counter the US cruise missile strike.** Moreover, to protect against a similar strike in the future, Maltsev believes Al-Shayrat would need four to five S-400 battalions, alongside a radar reconnaissance system to provide depth of detection against cruise missiles, in addition to an air regiment of Su-30SM or Su-35 fighters (Gazeta.ru, April 7).
> 
>...

> Noting the Russian defense ministry version, which places the attack between 03:42 (Moscow time) and 03:56, the author argues nearly 30 pairs of Tomahawks were fired almost simultaneously. The time interval from the lead pair to the final pair was about seven minutes, giving a total time interval of 14 minutes. **Fired from south of Crete, in the Mediterranean Sea, at a distance of 1,100 km from the Syrian coast, Russian air defense could not have detected the launches. Novichkov highlights the use of EW-18G Growler aircraft to provide electronic warfare (EW) cover for the attack, and suggests the cruise missiles could have crossed the Syrian coast close to Tartus, allowing some degree of tracking.** This would provide the Russian military with a real world lesson in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) in Syria, which can be applied elsewhere (Voyenno Promyshlennyy Kuryer, April 10).

This makes clear that it would have been very difficult for Russia to track the missiles, due to issues with distance, geography, and the use of electronic warfare by the U.S. to shield the signatures of the Tomahawks and confuse Russian radar.
 
The NYT provides the following account of the timeline associated with the decision making process of the White House:

[63 Hours: From Chemical Attack to Trump’s Strike in Syria
](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/syria-strike-trump-timeline.html)

In terms of strategy, it is quite clear that this was done for domestic consideration, something the Russians are fully aware of:

>“This strike is aimed at the U.S. domestic audience,” said Sergey Markov, a Moscow-based political analyst known for articulating views that are generally in line with Kremlin-approved orthodoxy, in an interview with VICE News. Trump, he added, “is failing to become a real president, they are blocking his policies, and he is trying to overcome the shortcomings of his presidency.”

and 

>“He’s not the not the first president to use war to deflect from a troubled domestic situation,” a scripted RT piece declared, flashing to a picture of former president Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the woman he had an affair with.

Interestingly, Russia is becoming used to the politicization of American foreign policy. Not just with Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats after Trump won, but also when the Obama administration did not veto a U.N.S.C resolution on Israel's settlements:


>“Lavrov warned against the impact of the U.S. domestic agenda on the Middle East Quartet and the UN Security Council,” the ministry stated. “He spotlighted harmful attempts to use these platforms for the Democrats’ and Republicans’ bickering.”

Lastly, I find Russia's claims about the Tomahawk's poor performance amusing, since they sound very similar to what the U.S. said about Russia's *own* cruise missile strikes back in October of 2015:

>[Four Russian cruise missiles fired at Syria from the Caspian Sea landed in Iran, unnamed US officials say.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34479873)

But what makes me laugh out loud at Gen Igor Konashenkov's lying is this statement he made in defence againts U.S. accusations that their cruise missiles landed in Iran:

>""Any professional knows that during these operations **we always fix the target before and after impact.** All our cruise missiles hit their target,"" said spokesman Gen Igor Konashenkov.



Huh, so if the targets are ""fixed"" why is he now claiming the Tomahawk's didn't land? Weren't they ""fixed"" as well and isn't he a ""professional"" too?

His voice is a bit frail now, but the mind, even at age 94, is as sharp as ever. So when I reached George Kennan by phone to get his reaction to the Senate's ratification of NATO expansion it was no surprise to find that the man who was the architect of America's successful containment of the Soviet Union and one of the great American statesmen of the 20th century was ready with an answer.

''I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,'' said Mr. Kennan from his Princeton home. ''I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves. We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. \[NATO expansion\] was simply a light-hearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in foreign affairs.''

''What bothers me is how superficial and ill informed the whole Senate debate was,'' added Mr. Kennan, who was present at the creation of NATO and whose anonymous 1947 article in the journal Foreign Affairs, signed ''X,'' defined America's cold-war containment policy for 40 years. ''I was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. Don't people understand? Our differences in the cold war were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime.

''And Russia's democracy is as far advanced, if not farther, as any of these countries we've just signed up to defend from Russia,'' said Mr. Kennan, who joined the State Department in 1926 and was U.S. Ambassador to Moscow in 1952. ''It shows so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then \[the NATO expanders\] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are -- but this is just wrong.''

One only wonders what future historians will say. If we are lucky they will say that NATO expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic simply didn't matter, because the vacuum it was supposed to fill had already been filled, only the Clinton team couldn't see it. They will say that the forces of globalization integrating Europe, coupled with the new arms control agreements, proved to be so powerful that Russia, despite NATO expansion, moved ahead with democratization and Westernization, and was gradually drawn into a loosely unified Europe. If we are unlucky they will say, as Mr. Kennan predicts, that NATO expansion set up a situation in which NATO now has to either expand all the way to Russia's border, triggering a new cold war, or stop expanding after these three new countries and create a new dividing line through Europe.

But there is one thing future historians will surely remark upon, and that is the utter poverty of imagination that characterized U.S. foreign policy in the late 1990's. They will note that one of the seminal events of this century took place between 1989 and 1992 -- the collapse of the Soviet Empire, which had the capability, imperial intentions and ideology to truly threaten the entire free world. Thanks to Western resolve and the courage of Russian democrats, that Soviet Empire collapsed without a shot, spawning a democratic Russia, setting free the former Soviet republics and leading to unprecedented arms control agreements with the U.S.

And what was America's response? It was to expand the NATO cold-war alliance against Russia and bring it closer to Russia's borders.

Yes, tell your children, and your children's children, that you lived in the age of Bill Clinton and William Cohen, the age of Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger, the age of Trent Lott and Joe Lieberman, and you too were present at the creation of the post-cold-war order, when these foreign policy Titans put their heads together and produced . . . a mouse.

We are in the age of midgets. The only good news is that we got here in one piece because there was another age -- one of great statesmen who had both imagination and courage.

As he said goodbye to me on the phone, Mr. Kennan added just one more thing: ''This has been my life, and it pains me to see it so screwed up in the end.''",geopolitics,Clinton

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

>The membership of CyberBerkut is anonymous, but reportedly includes former officers in the Crimean Berkut. That unit was part of Ukraine's Interior Ministry until Crimea's March 2014 annexation, upon which the Crimean Berkut was incorporated into Russia's Interior Ministry. CyberBerkut's ""Ukrainian identity"" is vigorously asserted, however, as it postures as an internal opposition group. 

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

I see from reddit.com/r/The_Donald that you people already hate Soros (links often lead to Russian disinformation websites) and think NATO should turn into a protection racket, ignoring basic hegemonic theory and forward deployment strategy of the U.S. near Russia and China. 

As an example, take a look at this conspiracy theory (and irrational) self post from /r/The_Donald:

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

For now, read some of this history regarding Soviet Active Measures (relevant to our current situation):

In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

&#x200B;

Martin Indyk is an experienced diplomat enmeshed in the Israel-Palestine for a long time. In this article he goes through each of what he views as the major issues and talks about what the status of these issues were in prior negotiations and how the Trump/Kushner plan addresses them. His argument is that what Trump's team has done is just go through the issues from prior talks and pick Israel's position on each issue. He argues that this approach misunderstands what is required if you are interested in reaching a negotiated peace treaty.

Key Quote:

>Even though Trump is quick to decry the failed efforts of past administrations, his team actually drew on the concepts, the principles, and even the wording of previous plans. Past U.S. mediators, however, tried to establish a basis for agreement by bridging the disparate positions of the two sides. The Trump team simply resolved the issues by sleight of hand: it decided each of the final status issues—borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and mutual recognition—in Israel’s favor before the negotiations even begin.

His examples:

**Security**:

>U.S. negotiators have always paid particular attention to securing the border between Jordan and a future Palestinian state, lest that frontier become a gateway for armies or terrorists crossing into the West Bank and thence into Israel. During the administration of former President Barack Obama, a team of U.S. security experts, in consultation with their Israeli and Palestinian counterparts, developed a plan by which Palestinian security forces could gradually assume control of the border; over a period of many years, the Palestinian forces would have the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment and capabilities.   
>  
>From that plan, the Trump team borrowed the concept of establishing security criteria and the metrics for measuring Palestinian progress—but applied them instead to internal security within the Palestinian state, with Israel being the ultimate judge of Palestinian performance. It resolved the matter of border security, meanwhile, by simply giving the entire Jordan Valley to Israel. The Trump plan would thereby surround the Palestinian state with Israeli territory, severing its contiguity with Jordan and turning Jericho into a Palestinian enclave and the Palestinian state into a Bantustan. 

**East Jerusalem**

>Since the Clinton administration, for example, the equitable basis of all U.S. proposals for Jerusalem has been the stipulation that the Arab suburbs of East Jerusalem should come under Palestinian sovereignty and the Jewish suburbs should come under Israeli sovereignty. The Trump plan, however, puts almost all of East Jerusalem’s Arab suburbs under Israeli sovereignty, leaving to the Palestinians one Arab suburb and a refugee camp on the eastern side of the wall that Israel abandoned during the second intifada. On that sliver of East Jerusalem, the Palestinians are now told they can build their capital, severed by the wall from both the al Aqsa mosque and the 300,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.

**The Old City:**

>Previous negotiators struggled to reconcile the competing claims to sovereignty over Jerusalem, particularly in the Holy Basin that encompasses the Old City and the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy sites therein. In the past, the negotiators sought to dissolve the sovereignty issue in favor of joint governance for the Old City. The Trump team instead resolved the matter by granting Israel sovereignty forever over the entire area, including the Christian and Muslim Quarters and the al Aqsa mosque.

**Settlements**:

>As to settlements, past Israeli and Palestinian negotiators considered having Israel annex the main settlement blocs situated along the 1967 border between Israel and the West Bank, so long as the Palestinians received equivalent land from Israel to compensate. Under such an arrangement, 85 percent of the settlers on some 3 to 5 percent of West Bank land would be absorbed into Israel. The outlying settlements in the heart of the West Bank would be evacuated to allow for a contiguous Palestinian state. Trump’s peace team adopted the idea of land swaps—but the plan offers arid land on the Egyptian border to compensate for the incorporation of all the West Bank settlements into Israel, including the outlying ones. The result would be a Swiss cheese Palestinian state with no possibility of territorial contiguity. Instead, the Trump plan proposes “transportational” contiguity, through tunnels that would connect the islands of Palestinian sovereignty. Those tunnels, of course, would be under Israeli control.",geopolitics,Clinton

Typically HW Bush is somewhat revered as the last great foreign policy president. However Bill Clinton in 1999 reneged on that promise and expanded NATO eastward towards the border of Russia. Subsequent presidents have followed in his footsteps. Was this a mistake?

As we all are well aware, geopolitics has heated up especially during the Trump years. We can wonder if NATO expansion was a good idea in hindsight. Now of course eastern Europe has a much stronger guarantee of protection. However there are many questions that we don't fully know but can speculate on:

Would Russia be as belligerent if they didn't perceive an immediate threat at the border?

Would Russia be willing to go silently into the night if they had a large buffer region?

Would eastern European countries be & feel as safe?

Wouldn't the US be able to pivot to Asia much more effectively?

Would the EU have expanded as much without the tandem of NATO there as well? (Yes I know every country in the EU isn't in NATO, but the two have been partners in Europe for quite awhile)

[Senator John McCain independently contacted the Australian ambassador after Trump's phone call with the Australian PM](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mccain-makes-nice-australia-after-trump-s-blunt-talk-pm-n715916), and likewise made public statements about US-AUS alliance. Whether you view McCain's efforts as a (well intentioned and friendly) ""cleanup"" or a (hostile) attempt to contradict/undermine the Administration's diplomatic line, this kind of ""second lane"" diplomacy has been happening in public in many other cases (e.g. UK, NATO). It seems to me to have little precedent.

3. **Without getting political**, outside-America observers may perceive relatively big ""known unknowns"" about the Trump presidency compared to the usual state of affairs for an incoming President. For example [the US Senate's counterintelligence investigation into Russian possible influence on the election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/senate-intelligence-committee-trump-aides-russia-links) has the potential to *at least* cause the dismissal of high ranking administration officials such as Flynn. [Currently, public polls show about 40% of US public wants Trump impeached.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/02/after-2-weeks-voters-yearn-for-obama.html) This is higher than on the eve of Clinton's impeachment, and even for Nixon for all but the tail end of the Watergate affair. While part of this figure could be explained by deepening partisanship in USA politics, it raises uncertainty for foreign observers of US's internal politics.

Do you think - again, as a purely apolitical question - state actors are hedging on the idea that Trump may not be their 4 year diplomatic partner? 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of publicly engaging in ""two lane"" diplomacy? Surely at least one disadvantage would be earning the ire of the Trump Administration.

https://preview.redd.it/9xde20397k821.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4ee36b8cd3873b0331a9306c3e7668c951a7a5e

It has been recently confirmed that after another clash with Donald Trump on the withdrawal of US troops from parts of the territories of Front and East Asia the US Secretary of Defense James Mattis decided to resign.

General James Mattis, one of the most respected by both leading US political parties, will leave the post at the end of February 2019.

&#x200B;

However, the resignation of Mattis, according to some analysts, is not so much connected with the US policy towards key world players, but with disagreements over actions in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

It is known that the Pentagon chief wrote his letter (where, among other things, there are such words: ""you have the right, Mr. President, to have a defense Minister whose views coincide better with yours"") with a resignation after the American President surprised everyone with his unexpected decision (about the complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria and a 50% reduction in the us military presence in Afghanistan).

&#x200B;

Mattis, as well as a significant proportion of his officers, spoke sharply against such a decision, as it is reasonably believed that in the case of withdrawal of American units from Syria, the formation of their Kurdish allies is very likely to face an attack from Turkey. And this is the minimum, and the maximum – to Turkey can join the Syrian government and Iranian troops, which will entail the loss of the Kurds occupied areas of Eastern Syria.

The Pentagon chief, among other things, considered the decision ""a betrayal of America's allies"" and wrote that ""at that time, the United States remains the leading nation of the free world, we are unable to protect their interests and to fulfill its role on the international stage, not maintaining strong alliances with our allies and showing no respect for him…»

Very indicative reaction to the occurred resignation among the highest American officers. So, Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Mark Warker said:

""The resignation of the Mattis is scary. He was an island of stability among the permanent chaos characteristic of the Trump administration.""

&#x200B;

According to William Cohen, the Secretary of Defense under Democratic President Bill Clinton, Mattis did an excellent job.

""However, it cannot be expected that he will firmly support the actions of our President in the event of a crisis, who has shown himself as a person who does not respect our allies and is not grateful for their help.""

In principle, it is now believed that the resignation of General Mattis has long been predicted, however, his calm determination and firm views allowed to bring calm and order to the chaotic flow of decisions of the Trump administration.

&#x200B;

It is known that on the eve of the resignation Mattis had a long personal conversation with the President, who tried to convince him of the need to maintain a military presence of America in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, as the withdrawal of American troops from there will lead, in his opinion, to a geopolitical catastrophe.

For the above countries, Mattis rejects Trump's idea that it should completely withdraw US troops and provide the fight against the remnants of Islamists to local security forces. In the case of Syria, it is possible even to transfer control over the entire Eastern Syria to the much stronger Syrian government army and the Damascus regime, that probably became more humane-oriented.

18,How to defeat ISIS and Islamic Extremists in general - bombing won't do it,19.0,2j1384,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/2j1384/how_to_defeat_isis_and_islamic_extremists_in/,46.0,1413125711.0,"http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/how-to-defeat-isis-and-islamic.html

Stop Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait from funding them. They are their major donors.

Ban all Wahhabi schools in America and ask Europe to do the same. Stop Saudi Arabia funding extremist Madrassas in Pakistan. This will reduce future recruits for Islamic Extremists - be they ISIS or some other follow on group.

Even if you defeated ISIS militarily, some other Islamic Extremist group would spring up in it's place.
If you want to defeat ISIS, you should read how the SAS defeated Islamic Terrorists in Oman in the 1950's.

1. You have to take the local support base away. A guerrilla army cannot operate without local support.

2. You have to take their source of arms and funding away. See above that means getting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop supporting them.

3. You have to offer a better alternative than the one ISIS offers. That means as a first step to stop bombing people. Bombing ISIS is bound to kill innocent civilians as ""collateral damage"" which will just make things worse. It also means stopping the bombing of Pakistan and Yemen. The SAS in Oman took great pains to NOT to kill civilians. America kills far too many of them - it's a large part of the reason for ordinary people's support for ISIS.

4. You have to stop Turkey giving support to Islamic Extremist groups across the Northern border of Syria.

5. You have to stop Israel giving support to Al-Nusra (an affiliate of Al-Qaeda) across the Southern border of Syria.

6. Iraq
There will never be a military solution to ISIS, unless there is an acceptable political solution to Sunni's in Iraq. Iraq is an artificial country with Kurds in the North East, Sunni's in the middle and Shia's in the South. The sectarian hatred within Iraq is now so great after a decade and more of war, hostility, death, violence and poverty, that an inclusive political settlement is probably no longer possible. There will have to be a 3 State solution to Iraq to defeat ISIS. With the Kurds, the Sunni's and the Shia's all having their own country. For now ISIS should be contained in the Sunni dominated region that they now control in Iraq. They should be contained by the Kurds in the North West (as is already happening) and by the Shia militias, Iran and the Baghdad government in the South. A US bombing campaign will only strengthen ISIS support and serve to exacerbate the current crisis. Given time ISIS provincial government of the region will collapse from their lack of military progress, the lack of a unifying enemy to recruit further fighters, the difficulties of governing a large mostly poor, disparate group of people with numerous different tribal loyalties. Basic economics and human nature should be allowed to kill off ISIS. US bombs and bullets will have the opposite effect - as it has for the last 12 years.

7. Let Assad defeat ISIS and other Islamic Extremists in Syria.
Assad has the support base among the population in Syria that will allow ISIS to be defeated there, providing there is no interference or help to ISIS and other Islamic Extremist groups from neighboring countries (Turkey, Israel and Jordan - as there currently has. As well as stopping the money and arms supplied by the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait). The vast majority of Syrians are moderate Muslims and the last thing they want to see is Islamic Extremist Wahhabis and Salafis take over their country.

8. Withdraw American support for Israel.
Israeli war crimes such as the indiscriminate murdering of civilians in Gaza we have just witnessed and the constant Ethnic Cleansing and illegal settlement building in the West Bank is the other major source of recruitment for Islamic Extremists like ISIS and Al-Nusra.

9. Stop ISIS from selling their oil

A far simpler, less costly and much more effective measure than bombing people, would be to take steps to severely reduce the $2m+ a day of funding that ISIS is currently getting by selling it's oil production. But Congress are not voting on any measures like that.
ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day which it is selling at between $25 and $60 a barrel on the black market.
The crude is being transported in oil tanker trucks, mostly into Southern Turkey.
Presumably this is currently being done with the connivance (or even active collaboration) of the Turkish government.

We know that Kurdish oil is being loaded onto oil tankers at Ceyhan in Turkey from other reports.

What is congress and the media doing to investigate and prevent ISIS from selling their reported $2m+ a day of oil production?

Whoever is helping ISIS sell their oil, transporting it or buying it, is providing direct and material support for a designated terrorist organization.

A policing action in Southern Turkey to stop oil, weapons and fighters crossing the border with Syria, would be an effective counter measure to ISIS's current strength.

There are ongoing battles between the Kurds and ISIS to control the large oil refinery at Baiji and oil fields near the Kurdish border
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-iraq-crisis-oil-idUSKBN0GZ2BK20140904

Taking control of an industrial oil refinery would be a key strategic win for ISIS and should be prevented. If ISIS does manage to gain control of it, it should simply be blown up with a few bombs, preferably after warning the local population that bombs are about to be dropped to avoid civilian casualties. The Iraqi air force NOT the US should do this (there will be less blowback from an attack by Baghdad).

N.B. There are now reports of Obama bombing ""mobile"" small oil refineries that are capable of refining around 500 barrels of oil a day. This is a drop in the bucket - ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day and Obama is not hitting any of the oil fields. Most of ISIS's crude oil is being sold in Southern Turkey - see above. 

These are the ISIS refineries we're bombing. A drop in the bucket of ISIS oil revenues - around 1% http://mktplc.org/1wPv2tG

Why Obama's current strategy simply will not work and why he is lying to you

Both the FBI and CIA are against Obama's proposals to tackle ISIS because they won't work. Congress approved them anyway http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/httpclerk.html 

The Generals don't think that Obama's tactics are going to work either. They are now openly talking up the probability of a war against ISIS lasting another 20 years and so are Dem leaders:-

> Undiplomatic fuss when told new King Maha Vajiralongkorn was unavailable for a private audience because of his central role in the sacred ceremony.The Chinese official aired further displeasure when told neither was Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-ocha available for a one-on-one meeting during the elaborate event, attended by global dignitaries to pay condolences and last respects to a monarch many Thais viewed as semi-divine.Zhang was only placated after Mandarin-speaking Princess Sirindhorn, Bhumibol’s daughter, agreed to interpret part of the ceremony from his diplomatic viewing box, though the palace had earlier forbade simultaneous translation of the chants in line with historic protocol, according to Thai officials familiar with the events who requested anonymity.

&nbsp;

According to the article, the intention of the visit was also to extend an invitation to Vajiralongkorn, the than Crown Prince, to visit China. 

&nbsp;

While the consensus view is that China has made both strategic, military and diplomatic gains. the Thai Junta has ""have subtly withheld from Beijing, often in the name of upholding sovereignty and independence.""  > The author list several issues

&nbsp;

1.The US$5 Billion 873 KM Railway Line that will link Kunming in China via Laos to Thailand's east coast ports.  The project has suffered delays with the completion date pushed back from 2018 to 2023, and most likely won't be completed at that date, due to Thai insistence to use Thai workers and firms on the construction of the line. Only recently allowed some Chinese engineers to come and help with design. Furthermore, the Thais have preferred to put their attention on rail inks around Metro Bangkok. This link is **critical for China** because without this link the US$6.00 Billion China financed railway in Lao is useless. Since Construction has in December 2017.

&nbsp;

>Eight months later, however, the project has still made little building progress beyond a two kilometer track stretch reaching to the outskirts of Bangkok, analysts monitoring the construction say..

&nbsp;

2.Thailand purchases 3 Sub from China, at the initial displeasure of the US. The US has complain that it won't use the Thai naval base in the Gulf of Thailand,if the Satthip naval base, if the Chinese built subs are based there, fearing Chinese spies. One official said they might base the sub in the less strategic Andaman coast.

&nbsp;

3.While Prayut  has embraced Chinese business delegations, there has been little Chinese investment in Thailand. However, there is one sector that the Chinese have shown interest, is the surge in the number of Chinese tourist to Thailand. Rising from 1 Million per year in 2014, to 13 Million in 2018, 1/3 of all foreign tourist in Thailand, or making up 4% of Thai GDP  When there was the incident where the Thai Defense Minister criticized Chinese tour operators when a boat sunk in Thailand killing 47 Chinese tourist,  China didn't make a big fuss, as it sometimes does with tourist, because of strategic ambitions such as the Kra canal to by pass the Malacca Strait.

&nbsp;

**COMMENTARY**

&nbsp;

I am not sure whether the incident with the Vice Premier and the Crown Prince is true, because I haven't found any reports of such an incident, it could be in the Thai language website in the form of rumors as with a lot of press regarding the Royal family in Thailand. That being said, China has a habit of showing who is boss during funerals. If China felt the relations with Thailand was important, why did they only send a Vice Premier instead of the Premier (there are 4 VIce Premiers). The US sent Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis.   While in protocol a Vice Premier is higher than a Defense Secretary, but since the Thai rulers are a military Junta and US has extensive military links with the Thais, it makes show how important the relationship is to the US. Its like with the funeral of Lee Kuan Yew, they sent the Vice President, Li Yuanchao. The Americans sent Bill Clinton.   Both King Bhumipol and Lee Kuan Yew loomed large of their countries and Asia for over 1/2 century, in the case of Bhumipol even before the creation of the PRC.  The Thais are one of the few remaining monarchies in Asia are sticklers for diplomatic protocol and ceremony.  If you look at the order in which the Thais listed the foreign dignities who attended the Royal Cremation last year, heads of state and [monarchs who attended were listed first](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30330011). In Singapore they just listed in [alphabetical order for Lee Kuan Yew funeral](http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/list-foreign-dignitaries-close-friends-attending-mr-lee-kuan-yews-funeral). For Thailand Lesotho was listed first of the foreign dignitaries, because both the King and Queen attended the ceremony.  If only the monarch himself/herself attended he/she was listed after monarch / head of state who was accompanied by his/her spouse. 

&nbsp;

I wouldn't be surprised if the incident with the Vice Premier actually did happen. Chinese diplomats have a habit of putting their foot in their mouth [like in Namibia](https://www.namibian.com.na/70694/read/Geingob-tells-Chinese-ambassador-We-are-not-puppets). The American have a much better understanding of the cult of personality around the Thai Kings, because the CIA helped create it. they financed Bumipols rural development projects, his propaganda machine during the Cold War as a way of boasting the monarchy to curb the spread of Communism among the rural population.

&nbsp;

As regard to the railway. Building any railway / road project in Southeast Asia particularly in high density areas is always going to take a long time, regardless whether a country is a democracy or dictatorship, and the main reason is land acquisition. In the Bandung - Jakarta high speed rail link financed by China, they only bought 40% of the land after 4 years. Its most likely cheaper and faster to use Chinese workers, given Thailand itself has labor shortages. Unlike in other countries in SEA with relatively high unemployment rates like Indonesia or cultural suspicion of China like Vietnam, Thais doesn't have any of those factors. So why are the Thais so insistent that they do the construction themselves? Its sensitivity of building rail links from China into Mainland Southeast Asia. For centuries Mainland SEA has been cut off and protected from immigration and incursions from China because of climate and terrain. The only time they did invade a country in Mainland SEA outside of Vietnam was the disastrous Sino-Burmese War of 1765-69. The Thai Junta want to make sure they are the ones determining the route, the switches and signaling. 

&nbsp;

As for the submarines. The Thai Navy has been lobbying to get submarines for years. However, Thai military has a history of graft and questionable purchases, particularly the Thai Navy.  The Thai Navy is the only country in SEA to have an aircraft carrier that now spends most of its time anchored   

&nbsp;

Like with the railway, the submarines  contracts and acquisition have been facing delays [and little progress](https://thediplomat.com/2018/09/where-is-the-new-china-thailand-submarine-deal-headed/), even though the deal was signed in 2015. If the Thais were serious about the subs, it usually takes about 4-5 years from signing of the contract to delivery of the first sub, based on experiences of Malaysia with their sub purchases from France it took five years from the signing of the contract to delivery, and it includes training, because like Thailand, the Malaysian had never operated submarines before..

&nbsp;

Thailand doesn't get a lot of press lately, and as a result people overlook its importance.  If China could get access to Thailand, it wouldn't have to butter up to Cambodia and Myanmar. Chinese strategic objectives could be met through Thailand alone.  For China its not going to be easy to influence a country like Thailand for the following reasons:

&nbsp;

1.Thailand has been under Western-Japanese influence since late 19th century. because it was never colonized formally by the West or Japan, Thais don't have the antipathy they have toward the Japanese or Westerners.  Thailand was an ally of Japan during the War, Japan is the largest foreign investor in Thailand, and has been like this for 50 years.

&nbsp;

2.The Thai political system is fractured. You have the military, the King-Palace and civilian politicians. Because of the presence of the King, the last time Thailand had a strong military dictator was in the 1930s, since the 1950s the Thai King and military have symbiotic relationship. There are different centers of power. Both the Thai military s close ties with the US military, and the Thai King was educated in British public (ie private) schools and graduated from the  Royal Military College in Australia. China would have an easier time if Thailand was a civilian democracy.
 
&nbsp;

3.The difficulty with trying to influence a country like Thailand is its much more costly than Myanmar or Cambodia. its economy is 7 times larger than Myanmar's,  The Thai economy is a full employment, they draw in workers from poorer neighbors. 

&nbsp;

4..Even though Thailand has the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of greater China, at 9 Million, Thai Chinese  are very assimilated largely due to policies adopted by the Thai government in the 1940-50s, when they closed Chinese medium schools  and ""forced"" ethnic Chinese to take up Thai names. That was after a series of anti-Chinese riots in Thailand in the 1930-40s.

23,My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un,9.0,945nqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/945nqu/my_take_on_trumps_meeting_with_kim_jong_un/,6.0,1533262852.0,"1. We are caught in a strange historical moment. Trump, the American President just shook hands happily with a North Korean Dictator. 

2. US policy makers and president alike wouldn’t be caught dead shaking hands with a North Korean Dictator.  (Although Clinton did meet with the Kim Jung Il Citation: [https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089](https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-americans-met-north-korean-leaders/story?id=53635089)).  However President is Trump is an anomaly.  He truly seems to act on his own, good or bad.  So why was Trump able to set up this seemingly peaceful meeting, especially after all the “little rocket man” rhetoric?

3. North Korea is pretty isolated.  Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia.  Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly.  They share a small border as well.

4. In the Trump era, America has entered a strange space.  He doesn’t follow normal American policy, which is obvious.  

5. During the 2016 American presidential primaries the Republican Party changed an important party policy on the Crimea takeover by Russia.  Trump apparently directed the change to more or less support the Russians on the Crimea annexation.  Trump even recently repeated a talking point by Putin himself saying “everyone there speaks Russian”, therefore Crimea is essentially Russian territory.

6. Trump has flip flopped and given criticism to everyone in the past two years, even his own children.  The one person he doesn’t flip flop on?  President Vladimir Putin.  So what the hell is going on?

7.Earlier we mentioned North Koreas allies, which is important..  Who benefits from these Geopolitical decisions?  Because it definitely isn’t the US overall.

8. The United States has soft power all over the globe.  Its one of the great benefits of the Post WWII order, which the US directed.  America has “800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories” \[[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321)\]

9. Directly after Trump met face to Face with Kim he decided to cut off War Games with South Korea in the Korean peninsula, citing costs.  Trump seems to believe that saving money is more important than having a military presence in one of the nations most contested sea beds.  Just south of the Korean peninsula, in the South China Sea the Chinese have an unprecedented presence.  They have been creating entire islands in order to have more control over the vital commerce and shipping done by ship.   After World War II the United states had near overt control of the oceans and shipping lanes; something never accomplished by any other nation in history.  So why would the United States jeopardize this accomplishment?

10.  The winners here are many but not the United States.  China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea all gain wins from Trumps meeting with Kim.  Here is how:

11. China, Russia and North Korea gain a win by seeing the presence of the American military vanish.  In turn the Us military gets hit by losing a close vantage point where they can watch North Korea and China, while helping allies S. Korea and Japan.  America has more warships than any nation combined; even one of these vessels deters aggression in the region.  This sea is also close to Russia, who would like to see American warships vanish.  Trump thinks it’s a waste of money and wants to pull them out.  We’ll see.  

12.  However the world becomes a winner if the negative warmongering rhetoric and threats go away.  If Trump succeeds in getting North Korea to denuclearize it is a grand win for the World. 

13.  Lets tally up the geopolitical score here.  Putin wins in a few ways.  They see an ally of theirs \[N. Korea\] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world.  They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.  China also wins in these ways.  North Korea now looks levelheaded and willing to bring themselves into the fold of the global  order.  South Korea wins because this opens the field to possible reunification.  The capital of South Korea is 60 miles from the border with the north.  South Koreans have lived under the threat of bombardment of artillery and even worse: possible nuclear weapons.  Japan also wins in this way.  America wins if the North Korean threats are squashed for good, but only time will tell.  It’s a gamble but for a president who hasn’t been able to court any domestic wins overtly, it does seem to be a win for him and his administration in a strange way, albeit a confusing one.

In this post I will do a review of Anthony Scaramucci's article [How President Trump is Breaking a Destructive Cycle in the Middle East](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-president-trump-is-breaking-a-destructive-cycle-in-the-middle-east) publish in the  Atlantic Council.  Of course people would be wondering why a person like Scaramucci would have anything to say about Syria, but I think his piece is interesting because of the following reasons 1) Unlike most defenders of Trump's policies he attack the foreign policy establishment / elites 2) Mentions the delicate balance faced by both Trump and Obama ,  disengaging from the Middle East while ensuring the stability of the region 3) Provides a global perspective.  its not best article out there, but it covers the key factors. After summarizing the article I will answer some questions 4 questions based on the articles I read about the Syrian withdrawal

1. WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?
2. WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?
3. WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?
4. WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

The problem with people when they look at Trump's foreign policy, they don't develop a framework or angle of attack, people get obsessed with his antics. In this post I am not so concerned about accuracy, but the framework. However, before beginning with the summary, I will provide two articles, one from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/trump-syria-withdrawal-us-troops) and the other [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/blog/trump-right-withdraw-syria), arguing about dubious legality of US intervention in Syria from an international law standpoint, but also that it wasn't authorized by Congress.  The problem with these article is they don't really provide a balanced geopolitical assessment why Trump made the decision he made.

# SUMMARY

Scaramucci starts off by referring to  Fred Greenstein book Th*e Hidden-Hand Presidency* that things are not exactly as they appear. The book was about the Presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, The Greenstein argues that beneath Eisenhower's placid exterior there was great political activity.

**OPINION:** I would argue that with Trump that despite the chaos. Trump has a worldview and Trump's foreign policy objective aren't too different from Obama's, only the tactics and methods used may vary, For the commentators about the withdrawal from Syria they might consider this in the realm of strategy in the Middle East, but to the US President in global scheme of US foreign policy it is just a tactic.

Scaramucci makes four points about US policy in the Middle East

1. Problems in the Middle East are intractable. The US has spent US $6 Trillion and 7000 Americans had died in Iraq and Afghanistan over a course of 17 years. Drain on American resources that could be better spent at home on infrastructure and education
2. Completer disengagement is not an option for the US, but the US can't be everywhere.  This is a dilemma faced by both Trump and Obama, and both have tried to find the balance.  While Scaramucci says that a number of troops are need to maintain stability he says  **However, largescale occupation without a clear exit strategy is a fool’s  errand. Since World War II we have shouldered the great burden of  securing peace and prosperity for the free world, but more than seventy  years later, if we do not receive more proportional help from our allies  this magnanimous approach will become unsustainable.**
3. He wonders if the the policies and interventions in the Middle East would be different if there was conscription or a draft.  Scaramucci mentions Eisenhower's speech about the Industrial Military complex.
4. As the US is bogged down in the Middle East, China is ramping up its foreign intervention, building artificial islands in the SCS and expanding its influence through the BRI.   **Hopefully China and the United States avoid falling into Thucydides  Trap, but if military confrontation does materialize, will we be  economically and strategically prepared for it? Trump is the first  American leader to confront China on trade. In the same vein, his policy  of engagement with Russia and North Korea is part of a strategy to  develop additional security in the region.**

Last, Scaramucci pleads   **As our democratically elected leader, he  deserves room to execute his alternative approach to foreign policy.**   

**OPINION:**  As Scaramucci has said about the Obama and Trump dilemma in the Middle East can be applied to their foreign policy.  There is more similarities between Obama and Trump's foreign policy than that of Obama and Clinton for example.[Both Obama and Trump felt that US traditional Western and East Asian allies weren't pulling their weight when it came to security](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-security-commentary-idUSKCN0Z72OW).  The difference was the tone, with Trump being much more vocal.  Outside engagements in the Middle East, since the Cold War., the amount the US spends on defense isn't a lot as a % of GDP, but that is only part of the argument. Even the Baltic states spend about 1% of their GDP and they are the most vulnerable.  Granted the US gains benefits from this arrangement, but its reasonable to ask the US allies to spend more. [Germany is so obsessed about budget surpluses, that its under funding its rail system, I can't imagine what the Bundeswehr looks like](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/why-german-trains-dont-run-on-time-any-more).

Both Trump and Obama wanted to pull out troops from the Middle East, and they were lambasted by the establishment for doing so. This is what Trump had to say about the Middle East

>[It’s very  important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we’re going to stay in  that part of the world. Now, are we going to stay in that part of the  world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a  reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/trump-israel-one-reason-for-u-s-troops-to-remain-in-middle-east-1.6697591)

. And for both Obama and Trump it was a key campaign promise. Obama has faced criticism for his pull out of prematurely pullout of Iraq in 2011, but Obama didn't anticipate the instability caused by the Arab Spring in late 2011. Moreover, much of the instability in the Middle East was caused by the Iraq invasion of 2003.  Right now, Trump is facing the similar criticism  regarding the pullout from Syria.

Both Trump and Obama have been accused of abandoning and alienating allies The right accused Obama of alienating [Saudi Arabia](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/barack-obama-has-nobody-to-blame-but-himself-for-alienating-saud/), Turkey, [Europe](https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/opinions/obama-europe-tisdall/index.html) and [Israel](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/12/obama-israel-kerry-allies/511796/), and appeasing Iran. Trump has been accused of alienating close allies like Canada, Japan and the Europeans.  One must understand, the system of alliance is a tool for the US, it isn't end in itself for maintaining US security and interest.  The US can afford to push around its core circle of allies, because frankly they aren't going anywhere.  It will take a lot for the likes of Canada to switch over to China/Russia, and so far outside of snubs and insults by both Obama and Trump, the US hasn't done a lot to disturb these relationship.  Trump has signed new trade agreement with [Canada and Mexico, as well as South Korea, which aren't much different from the previous agreements](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-nafta-gets-a-new-name-but-little-else-has-changed/).  This also applies to dependencies like Saudi Arabia and Israel. People were complaining how Obama ""mistreated"" Saudi Arabia and Israel, but the reality is who else are they going to turn too?  Trump's approach to authoritarian allies is different from Obama's, but I think in the grand scheme of things its more tactical.  US allies are like dogs, some are thoroughly domesticated, some semi-domesticated, some feral.  The ones you have to be careful are the semi-domesticated ones, a good example would be non-Western democracies and hybrid regimes like Philippines, Thailand and Turkey, Trump's decision to pull out of Syria benefited Turkey the most. And for a geopolitical viewpoint, which I will talk about in more depth later on, Turkey position in the Middle East in the long run is the strongest.    Disagreement with the West largely was centered around support of Syrian Kurds. The Kurds already have Iraqi Kurdistan, so its not a question of building a homeland for the Kurds. Furthermore, a Iraqi Kurdistan is faced with political divisions and flagging economy, despite the control of oil fields. How would a Syria Kurdistan look like ?  [Rex Tillerson tried to smooth things over with Turkey](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rex-tillerson-offers-olive-branch-after-turkey-warns-alliance-could-break-completely). The decision to abandon the Syrian Kurds and shift backing to Turkey was almost a year in the making.  Since the capture of Raqaa in October 2017, Trump has been asking about a withdrawal.

Both Obama and Trump objective is pivot to Asia to counter China, or go back to US strategic objectives prior to 9/11. Obama's Asia pivot which was announced in 2011 was weak because it was distracted by [Arab Spring in late 2011, and than Russian annexation of Crimea.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/asia-pivot-obamas-ticket-out-of-middle-east/)  The difference between Obama and Trump, is Trump is more single minded about China.  Most of the post here talked about the Syrian/Afghanistan troops withdrawals in isolation, without referring to [Xi Jinping's speech about commemorating 40 years of reform](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/181218022820736.html), charges against [two Chinese hackers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/20/tech/chinese-hacker-charges/index.html) and the rebuke of  state sponsored [Chinese commercial espionage by the US and her Western allies.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-21/australia-joins-condemnation-of-chinese-espionage/10645414) [In 2015, Xi and Obama had reached an agreement that there would be no state sponsored commercial spying, while the Chinese has reduced their activity in 2015 and 2016, once Trump came to office it wet back to normal.](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/us-china-reach-historic-agreement-economic-espionage/)  From a regional Middle Eastern lens, Trump's withdrawal in Syria and Afghanistan seems hasty and on the fly. This is where I differ from Scaramucci. If one looks at it from a global perspective, its not. Trump's is basically telling China ""You are our number one strategic concern""

# QUESTIONS

**WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?**

* ISIS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, AND AS TRUMP SAID THE SYRIANS, TURKEY, IRAN AND RUSSIA CAN FINISH THEM OFF. THERE WILL BE NO VACUUM
* THE NARROW AIM OF DEFEATING ISIS HAD BEEN EXPANDING TO A PROXY WAR AGAINST IRAN AND RUSSIA, AIM OF SECURING PEACE WITH ASSAD, PROTECTING ISRAEL AND THE KURDS (MISSION CREEP)
* THE 2200 US TROOPS IN SYRIA MOSTLY USED FOR TRAINING. NOT ENOUGH TO FULLFIL FURTHER OBJECTIVES.
* IN 2011, THE US KNEW LITTLE ABOUT NE SYRIA. HAD NOT NATIONAL INTEREST

[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trumps-surprising-decision-withdraw-syria/578755/](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trumps-surprising-decision-withdraw-syria/578755/)

**WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?**

* ISIS MIGHT REGROUP AGAIN. *UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT RUSSIA, TURKEY, IRAN AND SYRIA WON'T ALLOW THEM*
* HANDS A VICTORY TO ASSAD AND PUTIN. *THE OBJECTIVE WASN'T OVERTHROWING ASSAD BUT DEFEATING ISIS.  ASSAD AND PUTIN HAVE SUPPOSEDLY WON. BUT ALL PUTIN AND ASSAD HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE A WEAKER POSITION THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE WAR.  IRAN IS MORE ENTRENCHED IN SYRIA, AND TURKEY WILL EVENT UALLY CONTROL MUCH OF NORTHERN SYRIA.*
* ABANDONING ALLIES -- *THE KURDS IN SYRIA. THE KURDS IN SYRIA WERE ALWAYS IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION. TRUMP'S CRITICS TALK ABOUT MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS AND ALLIES, BUT WERE WILLING TO THROW TURKEY, A NATO MEMBER, UNDER THE BUS WITH REGARDS TO TURKEY'S EXISTENTIAL ISSUE - THE KURDISH QUESTION. NATO ISN'T A INSTITUTION FOR DEMOCRACIES. PORTUGAL, GREECE AND TURKEY WEREN'T DEMOCRACIES WHEN THEY JOINED NATO.*
* THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HASTY, AND REMOVED ALL LEVERAGE AND INFLUENCE THE US HAD. US TROOPS REMAINING IN SYRIA WOULD SERVE AS A BARGAINING CHIP. *BUT GIVEN HOW AGREEMENTS ONLY LAST AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO EXERT INFLUENCE WAS THAT A REALISTIC ASSUMPTION*

**WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?**

Peter Zeihan, who wrote the book Accidental Superpower, is a controversial figure in geopolitics, talks about the end game in Syria / Middle East as being a US withdrawal from the Middle East. The question is what should the end state in Middle East look like? Should it be a local hegemon ensuring it remains stable and static, or should it be a balance of power, where all sides balance each other out.. Peter Zeihan isn't an expert on the Middle East, but he does raises interesting question. Obama opted for balance of power as Zeihan elaborates

>That left option two: establish a regional balance of power so the  region would self-regulate. This balance, ultimately, is what the  nuclear deal sought to achieve: partially rehabilitate Iran, partially  reintroduce it into the international system so that Iran could  counter — and be countered by — the other regional players. In doing  so — or so the theory goes — the region’s wars will be many, but  limited.The key selling point of the balance-of-power option  was that the Middle East has so many competing centers of power that no  single country would ever be able to gain a significant, long-term  advantage. That would keep any of the (many) expected battles bottled up  within the region. It sounds a bit cruel, but the ongoing civil wars in  Syria and Yemen are good examples of the balance-of-power strategy *working* because those conflicts keep the region’s powers at one another’s throats.

At the time of the writing, Trump had scarped the nuclear deal with Iran, and had no replacement.

>Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal does two things. First, it  wrecks the balance-of-power strategy by gutting the possibilities of the  region’s most active player: Iran. The resurrection of global financial  sanctions on Iran will — at a minimum — halve the country’s export  earnings by year’s end. This means the Americans will need a new  strategy for the region. At present, the Trump administration hasn’t  offered anything as to what that might be. But that is an issue for  another day.

At least with regards to Syria, I think a static equilibrium is emerging. The Russians have pulled outo f Northern Syria, and the Syrian government have told the Kurds

>[According to political sources in  Damascus, the Syrian Army will not come to the aid of the Kurdish  warriors but also will not join the Turks in their extermination. Rather,  they will stand by and watch, waiting to see who collapses first, the  Kurds or Erdogan. The policy resembles that of the Reagan  Administration, which stood by and watched the Iran-Iraq War of  1980-1988, hoping that it would either rid them of Khomeini or Saddam  Hussein.](http://www.atimes.com/article/damascus-to-stand-by-as-kurds-face-turkish-onslaught/)

Is Turkey going to be the local hegemon that he is referring too. Zeihan himself dismisses Turkey, while he argues Turkey does have the capability and unlike Iran or Russia, can pour troops into Syria to become the hegemon.  [Zeihan correctly raises the question whether the Turks want the ""crown"", given Trukey's continued interest in joining the EU](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-eu-full-membership-european-union-commitment-president-a8274166.html).  For Turkey the occupation of North Syrian is more to drive out the Kurdish militant groups and establish a buffer.  He also questions whether or not any local hegemon will have US interest at heart. [It appears that Trump has bought into Erdogan promise to wipe out ISIS](https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/turkey-biggest-winner-of-us-syria-withdrawal-1.61074777). While some have question Erdogan sincerity.

WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

MAN OF HIS WORD

First, **Trump is a man of his word** . While his actions are erratic, but what is consistent is his desire to keep his [big campaign promises.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/09/trump-iran-deal-lowry-218355) This is important with regards to foreign policy, because a US President faces far less constraints on foreign policy as he does on domestic policy.  It is like he has mental to do list seared into his brain.  Trump is relentless until the item is completed and done.

>[The list is long and growing. He pulled the United States out of the  Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate pact and the Iran nuclear  deal. He will move permanently the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He  has slashed the US company tax rates and stacked the judiciary with  qualified conservatives. He has put a “travel ban” that restricted entry  to America from several Muslim nations, which the Supreme Court upheld  this week. On July 16, Trump will broker detente with Vladimir Putin in  Helsinki.](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/like-it-or-not-trump-is-a-man-of-his-word-20180629-p4zoib.html)

Trump said he was going to draw down troops from the Middle East and Central Asia, and this is him keeping those promises.     I am going to provide you a list of [Trump's foreign policy promises](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) drawn [various sources.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) To be honest a lot of Trump's campaign promises aren't really original, previous mainstream candidates have made such promises before, but it was expected that people won't go through with it.  The difference with Trump, is that he does.

* Cancel global warming payments to the United Nations
* Renegotiate / Cancel the Iran deal
* Build a safe zone for Syrian refugees
* Move Embassy in Israel
* Close parts of the Internet where ISIS is
* Bring back waterboarding
* Develop a plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days
* Establish a commission on radical Islam
* Reverse Barack Obama's Cuba policy
* Cancel the Paris climate agreement
* Call for an international conference to defeat ISIS
* Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization
* Ask countries we protect to pay more for joint defense
* Suspend immigration from terror-prone places
* Stop TPP
* Renegotiate NAFTA
* Raise tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.
* Cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take undocumented immigrants back
* Build A Wall and have Mexico pay for it.
* Improve Relations with Moscow
* Defeating ISIS and Pulling out of Middle East
* Increase Defense Spending

When you break Trump campaign promises into a list, a lot of his promises are very minor and mundane, nothing particularly ambitious or earth shattering.  Secondly, he has fulfilled most of his campaign promises with regards to foreign policy that doesn't require Congressional approval. Thirdly, in a democracy, the major promises made during the campaign is the contract between voters and the candidate. If a candidate promises to build 5 bridges during the campaign, and later on when he is in office promises to build 10 because more money has been free up. If he ends up building 7 bridges, he hasn't broken his promise. Trump isn't a person who will go beyond his contract

# TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY AND THE COLD WAR

[This last section is more speculative, even though I will provide sources. To under Trump's foreign policy, you have to understand the last two decades of the Cold War It was in the 1980s, that Trump moved from being a New York celebrity to a national one.](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/400185-trumps-foreign-policy-rooted-in-nixon-reagan-principles)

What Trump is doing with the withdrawals from the Mideast, his failed attempted to appease the Russians, to gain leverage against China, in the way the Nixon/Carter/Reagan did with the Soviets by normalizing relations with China in the 1970s.  Even as the US was normalizing relations with China, China was still supporting insurgencies in Asia and North Vietnam. The chaos and human tragedy that had befallen on Indochina after fall of South Vietnam is many magnitudes greater than the chaos brought about by the Arab Spring and ISIS. From a strategic perspective by 1979, for both China and the US, it was horrible decisions, Vietnam had switched to the Soviets and had occupied Cambodia.  Obama and Trump are responsible adults compared to Nixon and Kissinger

To some historians the Cold War was just a continuation of the Second World War. The main areas of conflict were still Europe and Pacific, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Western Europe and East Asia are the only regions with the population, industrial capability and proximity to threaten the US. If India's position was reversed with China, India wouldn't be as threatening to the US, because of its location. It could have to fight through China, Southeast Asia, Japan and cross the Pacific  to get to the US. US overall strategy during the Cold War, particularly in Asia, was defensive, because it was the status quo power.

Trump would like to take the world back to the 1980s, before NAFTA (1994), EU (1993) and WTO (1995).  Trump like most conservatives don't have a problem with multilateral organizations, but ultimately believes that disputes should be settled diplomatically rather than through independent judicial bodies. That is the fundamental difference between the NAFTA and the Canadian-US Free Trade Agreement it replaced as well as the WTO and GATT. [Its why the US has been holding up  new appointments to the Appellate Body](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-trade-barbs-at-wto-amid-calls-for-reform/4703772.html)

27,[Discussion] A strategic look and contemplating what is to come after the next recession in the West and the world,6.0,bdladw,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bdladw/discussion_a_strategic_look_and_contemplating/,12.0,1555361693.0,"Hello, sometimes ago here in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ag4evf/discussion_the_current_crisis_in_the_west_and/) I attempted to assess the reasons for the current breakdown of the liberal establishment across the West and the rise of what is called ""populism"". In it I pointed to decades of stagnant living standards for the lower classes/mass migration creating demographic changes/rising inequality as being the primary reasons that after the 2008 economic and 2015 migration crisis finally exploded into the forefront and brought the previously radicals into the mainstream, especially the radical right after 2015. 

I would also say that currently the populist label is being attached very liberally on different people that are very different and at times in close analysis turn out to not be really much ""populist"" if we use the traditional definition of it. From Trump, Salvini,Le Pen to Bolsonaro, Erdogan to Modi and Duterte it has been used without much of any explanation rendering it sort of into a buzzword. In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b6r00j/comment/ejssad6) comment I tried to give a very brief overview into the reasons for the current upsurge of illiberal politicians across the world.

As per the title, in this thread I would like to take another look at and contemplate as to what might happen if the liberal establishment completely collapses in the West after the next recession (feared by many to be near). A few points I would like to make:


- Many of the rising ""nationalists"" in the West can be rather called ""civilizationalists"", in the sense that they are not really interested in upholding only the nation but the entire Western or European civilization. Even many of the actually nationalistic politicians that are rising are also seemingly in favor of such civilizational Union or alliance between European Nations (including those in the new world).

- The above framework provides a plausible scenario for a rapprochement between the West and Russia. In this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/at7x9r/comment/eh0x3ym) I pointed at the prospects of how the future balance of power will likely be and why a rapprochement with Russia is important for the Western alliance due to it's own relative decline. The foremost obstacle to a rapprochement between them is the liberal establishment in the West and it's ideological outlook, but if it indeed collapses fully in the time to come leaving the aforementioned civilizationalists in power that alongside the changing balance of power can certainly see a rapprochement happen.

- The rise of visibly different minorities as a share of the population and the decline of the native majority in many Western countries is also seemingly creating a potential for ethnic conflicts there. If we look at history for empirical purposes then we can see that different groups of people tend to clash unless United against some external force. The fears of the majority, tainting of the minorities (especially Muslims) after large scale sexual crimes (cologne/the grooming gangs in Britain)/terrorist attacks (Berlin/Paris/nice/Brussels/London)/generally higher rate of crimes among them/in many cases being economically a drain and the plummeting of trust in the established liberal ruling class creates a fertile ground for radicals giving solutions to the problems related to minorities. Indeed it seems that many moderates are seemingly realizing the situation and issuing warning, from Hillary Clinton telling the EU to get a handle on migration last year to this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/) by David Frum to Francis Fukuyama arguing against ""identity politics"". The increasing polarization and radicalization of both sides and collapse of the center however will likely not see anyone from the established center providing solutions in the time to come. From what I assess the current situation is one where a large part of the majority is against migration and segments of it are becoming more and more radical, a larger portion is currently undecided and still backs the establishment due to inertia and distrust of the new parties and a small one vehemently in support of migration. I would also like to point to this [article](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/03/06/ignoring-immigration-is-empowering-the-far-right/) for some assessments on this matter.

- I would also like to quote from a previous comment of mine here as to what I think is at the root of the clash between liberalism and tribalism in the West currently:

> The last point I would like to make regarding what you identified as the clash between liberalism and nationalism that led to the 
> (currently increasing) weakening of liberalism in the West itself (it's Homeland) can also be to an extent ascribed to the 
> decoupling of liberalism and nationalism. In the 19th and much of the 20th century Western (American/British/French) liberalism and the established elite were not only liberals but liberal

> evidence of humans being inherently tribal and going from that I would say the currently happening political changes in the West  
> is really tribalism, be it nationalism or civilizationalism 
> rising back towards power and overwhelming a more idealistic 
> system.


Now onto what I think are likely to happen down the line:

- If the predicted recession comes this or the next year, that certainly will fuel polarization and radicalization on both sides of the North Atlantic.

- In North America and especially the United States I do think there is some serious potential for things to get worse quickly in the coming years. Significant portions of the radical right would prefer a second civil war or partition of the country that unlike in the 1960s this time is more ""logical"" and thus likely, the reason for that I would say is the declining portion of the ""white"" majority and especially them being already a minority in the most young generations with the forecast of fully slipping into minority status in the coming time that makes it immensely more easy to convince people the need to split the country or go all in now to keep dominance compared to in the 1960s.

- I think the liberal establishment currently is nearing collapse and another recession and/or migration crisis will likely see it fully collapse followed by the assumption of power by the rising radical right. Another sort of ""Arab spring"" can be seen happening in Algeria currently, and if Algeria takes a turn for the worse and goes the way of Syria or Libya unleashing large migration waves towards Europe while breaking down another dam between sub Saharan Africa and Europe then that will immensely help the radical or otherwise ""populist"" right into coming to power. The next decade I think will very likely see who prevails. The changing of the climate is only going to worsen the migration crisis from Africa and the middle East towards Europe as well as from Latin America towards North America that will help the radical right more than any other part of the political spectrum.

- If the less autocratic or more-or-less Democratic parts of this ""new"" right comes to power and fully becomes the establishment then I think Western societies will develop towards something like current Israel - largely socially liberal but ethnocentric with the conservatives having stronger cultural influence compared to now, the left discredited and marginalized and being seen as a ""suicidal impulse"".

- Relations with China and the Muslim world will likely worsen but can deepen with India. This I think is likely to happen because China and the Islamic world poses the kind of ""direct threat"" to the West that India does not while India itself is adversarial to China alongside Pakistan (a Muslim power) and public being receptive to becoming anti Islamic. Geographically also China and the core of the Muslim would (middle East, especially the Arab countries to Pakistan) stand between India and Europe, neither Europe and the West at Large (including Russia) nor India pose a direct threat to each other geographically while the same cannot be said about the relations with China and the Islamic countries in this regard. This can be compared to the situation between the entente and the central powers before the first world war with Europe and India in place of France and Russia and China and the Islamic world in place of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

Many other nations are also enriching uranium, as does Iran, and more are planning to do so, not because they want to make nukes but because they want to have an independent source of reactor fuel and don't want to become reliant on a cartel of fuel producers, as the US would want.

Nevertheless, Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, offers that the US ignored or even actively killed off in order to *prevent* a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive as a justification for a policy of imposing regime-change.

Mohammad Elbaradei, the Egyptian director of the IAEA noted this:
>""I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers

http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

Even in the first Obama administration, Iran agreed to the terms of a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey according to which Iran would have exported its enriched uranium in the hopes of receiving the reactor fuel it had been denied, only to see the Obama administration pull the rug out from under them AFTER Iran had said yes to the deal, upsetting the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just a week earlier endorsing the same terms that Iran had agreed to

http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

One American expert on Iran affairs, noted that the very day after Iran had agreed to these terms, the US proceeded to impose yet more sanctions on Iran

http://garysick.tumblr.com/post/611735702/giving-the-finger-to-iran-and-turkey-and

The Bush administration had started out imposing an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -

http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/

which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty to be able to make their own reactor fuel (which thanks to US sanctions, Iran was not able to import as usual.) This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal by making demands that *no country would accept.*

The second Obama admin eventually dropped the zero enrichment demand, http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-backed-key-u-s-shift-toward-iran-nuclear-deal-1441753099?mod=rss_US_News

and thus signaled that it is willing to actually resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. 

The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are POSSIBLY finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.

That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the pro-Israeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.

http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam

There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity.

http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530

So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs. 

To make up for the lack of evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program in the past, the issue is instead framed as concern about Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes in the indefinite future.

In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably.

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes.
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There is a significant difference: the *capability* to make nukes is not illegal but the media coverage obfuscates this significant difference. In fact the NonProliferation Treaty is actually also intended to *promote* nuclear technology (which has to be shared ""to the fullest extent possible"" and ""without discrimination"") -- thus having the ""capability"" to make nukes is not a violation of the NPT but actually an inevitable part of following the NPT.  

The US National Intelligence Estimate concluded that while Iran was engaged in ""nuclear-related studies"" until 2003 (for which the actual evidence is very questionable - more below) there's no sign they're interested in nukes now -

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/middleeast/us-agencies-see-no-move-by-iran-to-build-a-bomb.html 

a conclusion that the Israelis agreed with, http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/mossad-cia-agree-iran-has-yet-to-decide-to-build-nuclear-weapon-1.419300 

The Russians noted there was no evidence of nukes either http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/10/iran.russia

There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.

>Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php

According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:

>I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html

And

>With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

and

>The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece

Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director

>The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703

and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required, in addition to suspending enrichment of uranium entirely for more than 2 years in the past, and currently.

>""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it

Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA
http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511

So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks) say Iran is not making nukes

And actual arms inspectors

>Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case.

The US has been pushing some documents as proof that Iran supposedly engaged in nuclear-related studies (Called the ""Alleged Studies"" by the previous IAEA director, and ""Possible Military Dimensions"" by the new, US-backed IAEA director) until 2003 however the evidence -- to the extent the US has actually let anyone including the IAEA or Iran to see -- has been laughed at
http://www.ips-dc.org/whipping_wisps_into_storm_clouds_iran_and_the_alleged_studies/

There have also been a variety of half-baked leaks of ""proof"" of a nuclear weapons program in Iran, for example the ""AP Graph""
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-graph-suggests-iran-working-bomb
which turned out to be a hoax
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/ap-iran-nuclear-program-graph-explanation as was the general quality of the scientific evidence against Iran
http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/Flawed-graph-weakens-case-against-Iran-nuclear-program-video

The US had even pressured the IAEA to accept these documents as proof against Iran, but the IAEA refused, and the IAEA director Elbaradei called the allegations ""hype"" leading to some in Congress to accuse the IAEA of ""censoring"" the reports and hiding a ""Secret Annex""
http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/05/iaeas-man-in-dc-no-secret-annex-on-iran/
which proved Iran's nuclear weapns program's existence. The Israelis even accused the IAEA head Elbaradei of being an ""Iranian agent"" http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4146150,00.html.

The US went after Elbaradei, http://no.alt.diskusjoner.usa.narkive.com/dCbdwInF/jakten-pa-elbaradei including tapping his telephones http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57928-2004Dec11.html.

The IAEA replied that charges of it censoring info on Iran are ""baseless and politically-motivated"" http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917
and that there was still no evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran,
http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

But once the new US-backed IAEA Director, Amano, came into office after a highly contested election http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/26/us-nuclear-iaea-election-idUSTRE52O7P220090326
in which he had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks, and http://www.ips-dc.org/current_chief_of_iaea_releases_its_brakes_on_rush_to_war_with_iran/

Amano released the so-called ""Secret Annex"" that the previous iAEA director had refused to endorse, which supposedly proved everything about Iran's nuclear weapons program -- but despite the pre-release hype, it turned out to be a dud that didn't say anything new, and actually showed the evidence against Iran was ""thin"" as a former IAEA inspector concluded
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1109/Iran-nuclear-report-Why-it-may-not-be-a-game-changer-after-all

Later, the trial of a CIA whistleblower showed that the CIA may have even been planting evidence in Iran, so it could frame Iran
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-20/cia-s-nuclear-bomb-sting-said-to-spur-review-in-iran-arms-case
This book is all about that
http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338

In short, the previous US policy of trying to use the exaggerated threat of a non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons program as a pretext and justification for a policy of imposing regime-change in Iran, was a giant backfiring fiasco. It only led to Iran's further development of its nuclear program which now the US has to negotiate down, and also created a nationalistic backlash in Iran, where the vast majority of poeple support their governments position.

And actually Iran had been making BETTER offers that the US ignored
> In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  **Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered.**

If Russia is even mildly implicated in recent events, I will have to assume they were the ones to leak it. Who else would have any interest to, really ? The official story Wikileaks is pushing, of a ""rogue CIA contractor"", seems as silly as the Clinton email storyline of a ""rogue DNC operator"". Of course, nothing is certain right now. 

But it seems to me too convenient. Trump talks about an illegal wiretap while he's under attack by the Deep State for connections to Russia, suddenly Wikileaks throws out tons of material on how the CIA can wiretap individuals, throwing everything into confusion?

Opinions? Who do you think did it, and who will benefit? 

Carrying on this theme, even if it is speculation, if Russia is indeed behind it, then we might be witnessing the demolition of democracy in the United States through the intervention of a foreign power. A very interesting dynamic, are there any hystorical parallels to this?  ",geopolitics,Clinton

I thought we could perhaps make a new update thread since we're now halfway through the year.  The past 8 weeks alone have seen a lot happen so why not?

I'm no expert at geopolitics but I like to think I'm more informed than the average joe.  If anyone thinks I'm too far out of the park, please let me know why and do it in a respectable way (i.e. don't be a dick.)

1.  Hillary wins.  She gets 50% of the popular vote, Trump getting 41%

2.  The US will unfortunately see more mass shootings but there'll be 2 that polarizes the nation.  One being related to ISIS.  The other being related to the racial crisis (leaning more toward whites shooting blacks).  Both will occur around Halloween, Black Friday, and/or after Christmas but before New Years.  As a result, the US passes some of the most sweeping gun control laws since the Brady bill - possibly in the form of nationwide gun permits.     

3. The US will back away from it's objective to remove Assad and allow Russia to risk collapse to prop up Syria.  They maintain a strong presence in the region for fighting ISIS. 

4.  Turkey confirms it's transformation into an authoritarian state after months of endless purges and introduction of a new constitution.  After over a year of negotiation, the US and NATO will have a hand in orchestrating a much more organized coup and succeed.  The US' decision to allow Russia to prop Syria up pits both super power in a new type of race:  proxy war recovery.      

5.  Independent journalists investigate the links of Saudi Arabia's involvement with 9/11 and establish a direct link.  No armed conflict occurs but rather an economical war ensues.   Saudi Arabia makes a series of bad investments on it's pursuit to shift its income away from oil.  To seem tough, Clinton's administration will introduce sanctions on the country to kick them, the rest of the Western World follows suit.  The House of Saud humiliates its people and a coup ensues.

6.  While kicking SA down, US-Iran relations become more cordial.  The US courts Iran like a prom queen dating a nerd to make her jock boyfriend jealous.  Although the administration is successful at burying the hatchet with Iran, conservatives brand the Clinton administration as being weak/friendly to Iran.

7.  Post Brexit England experiences a significant economic slow down.  Essentially the same as the US circa 2008.  Scotland it's independence and rejoins the EU.  Large corporations that funnel tax money through Ireland are able to stabilize the country from going to another drawn out civil war.

31,A few questions about the Shayrat Airbase attack and surrounding events.,3.0,64oeyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/64oeyi/a_few_questions_about_the_shayrat_airbase_attack/,7.0,1491880798.0,"1. From what I've read the airbase was actively used by Russia for conducting airstrikes on ISIS and Al Nusra, assuming that Russian aircraft/supplies were destroyed in the attack, why hasn't there been a major formal response from Russia yet?

1. I know the UN and Obama had previously asked Assad to step down on multiple occasions and subsequently imposed economic sanctions, etc. Is the Assad government still officially recognized by the US and most western nations?  If so are there any international rules the US is breaking by funding/training certain Syrian rebel groups and the YPG, while maintaining communications with Assad's government? 

1. Was it president Trump who initiated the attack on the Syrian-Russian airbase? The chemical attack occurred on April 4th and the responding US missile strikes occurred just three days later. Is it even feasibly possible for a missile attack of this magnitude to be coordinated and carried out in such a short period of time starting with a presidential order? 

1. How does the attack compare to the ""accidental"" air raid on Deir Ez-Zor by CJTF–OIR last year? At least a hundred Assad soldiers were killed and it was most certainly intentional, a response to similar chemical attacks (couldn't find any articles linking specific chemical attacks to the air raid).

1. Given that the inciting indicent was the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun and that no declaration of war between Assad and the US has been made, I don't understand how the White House could have authorized the military to conduct a missile strike of this size (59 cruise missiles!!) on a recognized government and leader, who although responsible for war crimes and a number of human rights violations has not directly attacked nor claimed to attack the US or any of its allies.

1. I guess my real questions is are there internationally recognized conditions that allow us to launch missile strikes without declaring war? The reason it seems strange to me is because I've seen nothing but support from Trump's most well known opposers (Hillary Clinton, McCain), and a lot of criticism from conservative republicans. Also I thought it was weird that after the chemical attacks on the 4th, besides initially condemning and then announcing a military response, the White House issued no demands (atat least publicly) or ultimatums to the Assad regime.

According to the UN, from 1980 {after the Islamic Revolution} Iran's Human Development Index improved 67%, and Iran became a Highly Developed country.

China's HDI improved 70%, in comparison.


>According to UNDP calculations, between the years 1980 and 2012, Iran’s HDI value increased by 67 per cent – or at an average annual increase of about 1.6 per cent. During the same period, for other countries in the High Human Development group (the group containing Iran), the average annual gain was only about half of what Iran managed – 0.73 per cent. For all countries on the planet, the average gain was even less – only 0.69 per cent. This means that **Iran’s annual growth in its HDI was over double the global average**. Simultaneously, this would imply that – from a human development standpoint – during the period 1980-2012, Iran’s policy interventions were both significant and appropriate to produce improvements in human development.

This was *despite* post-revolutionary chaos, low oil prices, an 8-year war with a US-backed Saddam which included being targeted by chemical warfare (with direct US complicity, http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/ ) sanctions, sabotage, and Iran *single-handedly* hosting the world's largest refugee population of *4.5 million people.* http://www.unhcr.org/3b6814092.html
 
In comparison, Iran's HDI before the 1979 Islamic Revolution when the US-backed Shah was in power, was low and not rising http://www.photius.com/rankings/human_developement_index_1975-2005.html
 

This perhaps explains why most people in Iran are in fact content with their govt according to multiple independent polls (even taking into account any self-censorship by the respondents
)
http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/652.php

Every official in Iran, btw, is either elected directly or appointed by an elected body 
and Iranians regularly turn out for their elections at a rate of about 60% http://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Parsons_0.pdf

The level of educational attainment alone is amazing. http://www.mei.edu/content/educational-attainment-iran

FYI, for example, before the revolution, only about half the people were even literate.http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427elojmjo966q; 

Lieracy rates for women in particular was about 40%, but today more than 60% of Iran's university population is female, where they also form a significant portion of students in the sciences and high-technology fields

>Almost 60 percent of accepted applicants in recent years have been women, with tertiary participation rates among women doubling over the last two decades. http://wenr.wes.org/2013/04/wenr-april-2013-an-overview-of-education-in-iran/

https://web.archive.org/web/20000418102534/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/INST/jul99/iran.html

In fact Iranians as a whole are some of the best educated people in the world, 

>Iran’s education sector is the Middle East’s largest and most dynamic. A country of nearly 80 million, 60% of its population is under 30. It has one of the highest tertiary-education-to-workforce ratios in the world, 4.5 million tertiary students in any given year (significantly more than any other Middle Eastern nation), and ranks globally between Australia and the United States (US) as having 43% of its population holding tertiary qualifications. Remarkably by international standards, female tertiary education enrolment has also outstripped male student enrolment, with 60% of Iranian university students being women.
http://dearinassociates.com/tapping-iran-dynamic-education-sector-an-introduction-for-australian-institutions-and-business/

and Iran has some well-recognized universities that put out world-class graduates http://www.newsweek.com/surprising-success-irans-universities-87853 

And Iran is judged to be a world leader in areas such as biotech and nanotech

And the ""fastest growing nation"" in the sciences, generally
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country/

Apart from educational attainments, Iran's healthcare system is considered to be a world model, responsible for extending lifespans by an average of 22 years
http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2013/apr/01/un-stats-life-longer-and-healthier-iran

Lacking any actual evidence of any nuclear weapons program, the US instead claims that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons ""capability"", a capability that is simply an unavoidable part of having a nuclear energy program. More than 40 nations -- *about 1 out of 4 nations on Earth* -- already have the capability of making nukes quickly if they wanted to

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

The reason they don't, is because nukes are overrated

http://www.ippnw.de/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomwaffen/Mousavian_s_Lecuter_at_IPPNW_Berlin-October_22--2012.pdf

In reality, Iran's nuclear program was quite legal
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace

Not only had Iran allowed all *legally-required inspections* http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511

Iran voluntarily suspended enrichment for close to 3 years and had allowed *more inspections* than it was legally required to permit, with no evidence of a nuclear weapons program ever found

>""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be.""

And IAEA Director Elbaradei has noted
>I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges.

Instead of accepting any of these offers, the US kept moving goalposts and making increasing demands on Iran that were deliberately intended to be unacceptable including the demand that Iran *give up* its nuclear program first *before* negotiations could be held about that nuclear program. This was known as ""Zero Enrichment""

It was only when US finally gave up on the Zero Enrichment demand, in the second Obama administration, that the current deal became possible (*and not* because sanctions ""forced"" Iran to negotiate, since Iran had been trying to negotiate for a long time before)

And incidentally, by ignoring those *better* Iranian compromise offers in favor of creating yet another pretext for yet another stupid war in the Mideast for Israel, the US ended up causing Iran to *increase* the scope of its nuclear program. 

For example by denying Iran the right to *legally buy* fuel for a *medical reactor* that was not just *too small to be useful for nukes* but that the US had *given to Iran in the first place*, and was under *all applicable IAEA safeguards* (I'm referring to the Tehran Research Reactor or TRR) the US forced Iran to increase its enrlchment levels of uranium from about 3.5% to close to 20% - (which is still deemed as ""low enriched uranium"" well short of the over-90% enrichment required for weapons) in order to make its own fuel... 
 And then *that* quite predictable Iranian reaction was presented as evidence of Iran ""getting closer to making nukes"" -- never mind that Iranians repeatedly offered to cease higher-level enrichment if they could just buy the fuel from Argentina as usual, legally, but were ignored.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/opinion/30iht-edvaez30.html

Instead, the US demanded that Iran not buy the fuel, and not make the fuel, and those 800,000 Iranian cancer patients who relied on the reactor for medical isotopes should just go fuck themselves.  http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/302492/a-primer-on-irans-medical-reactor/

In fact as IAEA director Elbaradei noted, the US pressure on Iran only made the nuclear program more of a nationalistic issue there

>The line was ""Iran will buckle under the pressure"". But his issue has become so ingrained in the Iranian soul as a matter of national pride. They talk about their nuclear program as if they had gone to the moon. http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

and polls found that the Iranian *people* were actually more hardline than the govt on their nuclear program, with a growing portion supporting the idea of obtaining actual nuclear *weapons*
 http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR910.html

We also can't assume Iran must be seeking a nuclear *deterrent* through developing the capability to make nukes, though the Iranians themselves have stated that they were well aware that their nuclear program would provide them with weapons capability:


It is not logically possible to ptove that a country wont possibly one day, in the indefinite future, decide to make nukes however,  
aside from the fact that the Iranians suspended enrichment for years voluntarily as a gesture of good faith while in negotiation with the EU3 (which was undermined by the US
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html) the Iranians have long offered to voluntarily accept limits on their nuclear program *well-beyond* what is legally required, or accepted by other nation -not something a country seeking weapons capability would do.

In recent years, all the solutions explicitly or implicitly suggest partition:


·       The “two-state solution” presented by President Bill Clinton during the Camp David Summit and Taba talks (2000).


·       The Roadmap to Peace introduced by President George W. Bush (2003) and endorsed by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia.


·       The UN Security Council Resolution 1397 (2002).


·       The UN Security Council Resolution 1515 (2003).


·       The Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League (2002 and 2007).

There are many reasons to disagree with the partition solution (Post 19).

The EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY may rule out extreme situations such as:
1.   Sovereignty of the disputed territories to be totally in the hands of only one of the claiming parties either Israel or Palestine.
2.   Existing sovereignty should automatically continue, or that everything should remain in a status quo.
 3.   United Nations or any other party alien to the dispute. Several problems immediately arise (Post 19 for more details).

We started weeks ago with a new case study on the TERRITORIAL DISPUTES series. We centred the attention on the Israel-Palestine difference. The first ten posts introduced the difference, several views (people at large, academics, politicians, media) and assessed whom may have right to claim sovereignty over the disputed territories. We presented the concept of a colourable claim.

Post 11 reintroduced the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY and some key elements related to the people in Israel and Palestine (and the diaspora, refugees and settlers) respectively.  From there, we applied the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY to population and discarded the two state solution.

After dealing with population,  we focused on another controversial element: territory. From our previous posts, we have learnt so far that some of the main concerns related to the Israel-Palestine difference are:
Borders:  This is a constant matter of controversy. For the past few days, demonstrations along Gaza’s border have resulted in many fatal casualties. It is self-evident this is not an isolated fact but an ongoing issue. Israeli forces killed at least 60 people and injured more than 1,000 on Monday 14th May. The victims were demonstrators who had massed along its roughly 40-mile border with the Gaza Strip. 
Defence:  There seems to be no problem with defence. The territory being defended is obviously desirable although the task is one which can be shared. However, what would happen if another party (for example, a sovereign State with no part in the conflict like Iran or the United States or Russia) decided to invade the disputed territories? In the hypothetical scenario a third party decided to invade the disputed territories, who would defend them?

The links to the analysis below. Post 20 I introduce myself with a video for the first time. The idea is to build a community of people interested in solving this (and similar) differences by working together. I do not claim to have all the answers. I only aim to offer a platform for an open debate in which we can share information, views and discuss them.

Post 21 will apply the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY to defence. Thereafter, we centre on law and government. Finally, conclusive remarks by the end of the week.

REMINDER:
This is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.

In order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict. 

I’ll only post on r/geopolitics on Sunday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.

COMMENTS welcomed. GUEST WRITERS would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion. Enjoy!

>Lewis (and Joel Wit, and John Delury, et al.) would probably respond that all of these talks went nowhere because of our stubborn precondition that Pyongyang commit to nuclear disarmament. After all, if the talks aren’t really about disarming them, what are we even talking about? Except that according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [in 2014, the State Department got](http://freekorea.us/2014/04/17/yay-nuclear-blackmail-obama-admin-caves-on-n-korea-denuclearization-human-rights-in-face-of-nuke-test-threat/#sthash.zEzMiGlq.dpbs) Japan and South Korea to agree to “a moratorium on nuclear weapons development” in exchange for “timed infusions of economic assistance and international treaties.” To my eyes, that looks a lot like dropping our preconditions and (given Pyongyang’s history) a de facto recognition of North Korea’s nuclear status. The White House subsequently (sort of) [denied](http://freekorea.us/2014/04/17/yay-nuclear-blackmail-obama-admin-caves-on-n-korea-denuclearization-human-rights-in-face-of-nuke-test-threat/#sthash.kk734XYk.dpbs) this, and because Pyongyang didn’t bite, we never found out whether Congress would have paid for it.

Finally:

>Pyongyang has already broken an armistice, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, two International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreements, an inter-Korean denuclearization agreement, two agreed frameworks (in 1994 and 2007), a 2005 joint statement, a 2012 nuclear and missile freeze, and six U.N. Security Council resolutions. 

And then you take into account that North Korea just killed a guy with one of the WMDs that caused the U.S. to invade Iraq, in a crowded airport terminal, in a friendly nation.

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.

Some background information on the feud between Putin and Hilary Clinton.

Nations are run by people. People have egos. Those egos can be damaged. What we currently see today in America has been influenced by that.

Read that article, these are the comments from almost 10 years ago that created what we see in America. These are the comments that made the Democrats and specifically Hilary Clinton the target of Putin's IPb campaigns. These are the comments that lead to Russia helping elect Donald Trump.",Freethought,Clinton

8,Comparing Realclearpolitics vs Fivethirtyeight polling averages model: which is the better one?,6.0,p710vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Freethought/comments/p710vo/comparing_realclearpolitics_vs_fivethirtyeight/,0.0,1629323245.0,"[RealClearPolitics (RCP) version seems to average the last few polls and charts it.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html)  There doesn't seem to be editorializing other than they don't let the same pollster represent themselves twice in the averaging the calculation. As we know, not all polls are equal and frame the question in different ways, have different sampling biases, etc... so this polling average doesn't account for that.

[Five Thirty Eight's (538) version is completely editorialized to achieve a more accurate outcome.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?cid=rrpromo) They personally edit the results of every single poll (like literally, they change every poll's results), and weight how much the poll should affect the rating based on how much they ""trust"" the pollster. All of this editorializing is supposed to be done to make the data more accurate at predicting the outcome.

Well, here is how each one looked in the last two presidential elections vs the result that actually happened:

**2016 Presidential Election**:

||Clinton|Trump|(other)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ACTUAL 2016 Popular Vote|48.2% (+2.1% victory)|46.1%|5.7%|
|[Five Thirty Eight (538) rating on election day](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/)|45.7% (+3.9% victory)|41.8%|12.5%|
|[Real Clear Politics (RCP) rating on election day](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)|46.8%  (+3.2% victory)|43.6%|9.6%|

In the 2016 election, Five Thirty Eight VASTLY over estimated the amount of 3rd party/nonvotes and VASTLY underrated Trump's support. RealClearPolitics also overestimated the (other) column, but overall was far more accurate.

**2020 Presidential Election**:

||Biden|Trump|(other)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ACTUAL 2020 Popular Vote|51.3% (+4.4% victory)|46.9%|2.3%|
|[Five Thirty Eight (538) rating on election day](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/)|51.8% (+8.4% victory)|43.4%|4.8%|
|[Real Clear Politics  (RCP)  rating on election day](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html)|51.2% (+7.2% victory)|44.0%|4.8%|

In the 2020 election, the differences between 538 and RCP were less dramatic. They both overestimated the (other) column and underestimated Trump, but yet again RealClearPolitics was slightly more accurate.

\---------------------

**My Conclusion**: 538 takes other peoples polls, changes the data, and then calls their version more accurate. The task is on them (538) to prove why their editorial methods have value in the first place....which they fail to do. I don't see any research papers published on their website proving how their methods of altering the data are correlated with more accurate results. That's why I call it complete junk. And to make matters worse, they seem to be worse at predicting outcomes than the original sample data. Even if 538's numbers are more correct in 2024, it is because a broken clock is right twice a day.

RealClearPolitics might not be a perfect model, but at least it represents the data objectively and produces more accurate outcomes.",Freethought,Clinton
