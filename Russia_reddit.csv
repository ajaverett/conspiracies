0,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15926.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

intervention.

-	Motion doesn’t show why addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is now necessary to “vindicate their 
rights as well”.

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

Page 223

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 

(Missing pages)

Page 225

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later?

Please get this through your heads, 

None of that matters! IT DOESN’T fucking matter ok? We are all being still being dicked by the same people and same fucking organizations, and the same slave system. People seem to forget how many other players are involved in this game or theatre if you like, you still got China, Russia, U.N., Vatican, Intelligence agencies, media, banking cartel, Hollywood, Council of Foreign Relations, Rockefeller’s, Rothschilds, Israel Mossad... I could go on for days about how many problems the world has, but the point is it doesn’t really matter who you voted for, the show will go on according to plan regardless of your opinions and votes, because it has been planned.The problem isn’t just the players, it’s The WHOLE game, the other teams, coaches, umpires,
Referees, etc.

People are so deluded that they think Trump is going to bring down the whole cabal, stop the great reset, and mass vaccinations, and bring down the media, Vatican, China, U.N., lock up Bill Gates and the Rockefeller’s etc..
I’m sorry but the show is going to go on whether we like it or not, because the other players and “coaches” or handlers in the game still want to play, and they don’t give an ants dick who is selected, because they know the game is rigged in their favor. They don’t even care about the environment, what makes you think they care about you?
You think your that special they care about your wellbeing? That’s cute...

So don’t take this republican / democrat / conservatives stuff too seriously. These are all labels, they are constructs made by man, all they do is separate and divide us. They are all tools of the elite to control and manipulate you and play with your emotions.

Even if Trump is re-elected, you can bet on your life that the game plan would still continue. Because there’s Too many players that want it too continue, they have invested a lot of time and money and aren’t ready to lose it that easily.

The show must go on...

First of all, many thanks to the moderators of r/Conspiracy for giving us the space to present the proof that there was no Russian hack and take any questions people may have about it.

Here's some context about who I am and what I've done, taken from my Wikipedia page.

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.  
>  
>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.  
>  
>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).  
>  
>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Trailblazer was a modification of ThinThread, removing the encryption and auditing aspects, while expanding the mass data collection. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

[In 2017 I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at President Donald Trump's request to talk about my evidence that there was no ""Russian Hack""](https://larouchepac.com/20190506/former-nsa-technical-director-william-binney-must-testify-congress-expose-big-lie-russia). He promised me follow up meetings that never happened, and I would suspect the President was ever briefed.

Three key points that are essential to know.

1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

3.) The NSA would have known the hack was taking place, and would have direct evidence of it. We know this thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied. See my 2017 affidavit on this issue: [https://storage.googleapis.com/media.larouchepac.com/Binney%20Affidavit.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/media.larouchepac.com/Binney%20Affidavit.pdf)

23,An Open Letter to Everyone who has forever Mocked us Conspiracy Theorists,3376.0,conhke,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/conhke/an_open_letter_to_everyone_who_has_forever_mocked/,1397.0,1565470350.0,"You called us names. You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Russia

It's like when your mom would guilt trip you into eating a bowl of cold brussel sprouts & beans because some kid in Africa somewhere was starving to death. It's a fucking fallacy.

b-b-b-but that's actual real oppression! /s

No that's just the oppression you're seeing on the big screen now because the whole fucking media is blasting the Ukraine/Russia situation to you bottom feeders 24/7. As if oppression, suffering, and war WEREN'T happening up until the very moment TPTB (The Powers That Be) started spoon feeding you Russia-hate porn 5 days ago about THIS particular conflict.

b-b-b-but Russia is a real dictatorship you have 1st world problems! /s

Yet in Russia, people who didn't take a Covid-19 Vaccine can still LEAVE RUSSIA. I'm a fucking CANADIAN who's trapped in Canada and can't leave the country without a vaccine passport. How the FUCK is that NOT tyranny? Unvaxxed Russians can fly out of Russia but Canadians can't fly out of Canada? Tell me again how much worse Russia is than us /s

b-b-b-but Putin has protestors beaten in the streets! /s

And how are we in Canada above that when Trudeau did the same thing last weekend? Canadian's were beaten in the streets and hauled off to the bin in Ottawa for having views deemed ""unacceptable"" by the man in charge.

b-b-b-but the vaccine mandates are being removed on March 1st anyway! /s

And even if they remove SOME OF THEM on the provincial level does that mean we just ROLL OVER and let our Prime minister keep up the travel bans? As I already stressed, we have LITERAL travel bans on our own citizens, yeah kind of sounds like fucking TYRANNY doesn't it?

The point is, you should stop shaming us just because ""rEaL tYrAnNy"" is happening on the other side of the world. Where were you fucks when Obama bombed the living hell out of Afghanistan? Where were you fucks when Trudeau painted his face BLACK and stuck his tongue out with a banana in his hand singing ""DAYOOO"" (or honestly during any of his other million scandals).

But most importantly, where the FUCK were you when the Canadian government decided it would be a good idea to ban your fellow citizens from travelling across our great country, or when Canadian universities & colleges banned and de-enrolled their unvaccinated students on a split second decision (who PAID for their educations and got ROBBED).

Where were you all this time? You don't have to stare at your computer screens and seethe about Russia/Ukraine to feel like you're united against tyranny when it's already in the atmosphere around you. Beaten protestors, frozen bank accounts, emergency orders, digital vaccine QR codes, travel bans, the thousand lockdowns that bankrupted people...should I go on?

Per an agreement between the Clinton Campaign and the DNC: In exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings. https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

- In its self-described ""pied piper"" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new ""mainstream of the Republican Party"" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning, telling the press to take Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruz seriously, rather than marginalizing them. http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/

One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

This doesn't mean the sub sucks because these theories and posts started.

I mean Jesus christ guys, they shut down the pizzagate sub all together and then we had to go to Voat to discuss it. Imo- the DNC leaks proved that DNC rigged the primaries for Hillary against Bernie. Imo Seth rich was the leaker. Bang bang. Nothing like a good ol' random shotgun to the back at 4am with nothing stolen. And pizzagate... Well come on. If you have 1 brain cell and you did you research.. You know what's up.

Here's what the Pentagon itself has to say on this (note how not a single one of our politicians on either side has so much as made mention of the word ""schismogenesis"" in all this time since this report came out): 

> “**The process of creating societal rifts to expand existing divisions, and to Generate SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORS was called SCHISMOGENESIS in 1935.** The Office of Strategic Services, an institutional precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, used this theory in the South Pacific during World War II to sow disunity among enemy fighters and to create schisms in communities supportive of Japanese rule. Likewise, **the recent rise of EXTREMIST POLITICS in the United States and in western Europe provides growing evidence that SCHISMOGENESIS appears to have been fueled by RUSSIA, CHINA, and Numerous Other Hostile Actors** who can benefit from the cost-effective method of weakening the rules-based international order without directly confronting the West.” - https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/3693.pdf -- Page 13

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has on a multitude of occasions identified herself as a ""democratic socialist"". Let's see what the *Democratic Socialists of America* (an organization she has endorsed as speaking to her views) have to say about whether or not they want to end capitalism and replace it with communism (mind you, ""communism"" itself is merely the delusion used to sell people on the dystopian path to it called ""socialism""). Note all the 1984 double-speak and heavy use of euphemisms throughout:

> **Q.** Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?

> **A.** **In the short term we can’t eliminate private corporations**, but we can bring them under greater democratic control.

*ELIMINATE??? Did you catch that? ""Greater democratic control"" = State Control (that's what they don't come out and say).*

_________

> **Q.** Won’t socialism be impractical because people will lose their incentive to work?

> **A.** We don’t agree with the **capitalist assumption** that starvation or greed are the only reasons people work. People enjoy their work if it is meaningful and enhances their lives. They work out of a sense of responsibility to their community and society. **Although a long-term goal of socialism is to eliminate all but the most enjoyable kinds of labor**, we recognize that unappealing jobs will long remain. **These tasks would be spread among as many people as possible** rather than distributed on the basis of class, race, ethnicity, or gender, as they are under capitalism.*

*Capitalist assumption? This is commie speak.*

*Eliminate all but the most enjoyable kinds of labor??? That's just sheer delusion.*

*Who's ""spreading"" these ""tasks""??? Who's doing this assigning if not a centrally planned government they deny they're for??? What if I don't want to do the task???*

___________

> **Q.** Why are there no models of democratic socialism?

> **A.** Although no country has fully instituted democratic socialism, the socialist parties and labor movements of other countries have won many victories for their people. **We can learn from the comprehensive welfare state maintained by the Swedes**, from Canada’s national health care system, France’s nationwide childcare program, and Nicaragua’s literacy programs.

*""Comprehensive welfare state""??? That's COMMUNISM.*
________

> **Q.** If I am going to devote time to politics, why shouldn’t I focus on something more immediate?

> **A.** **Although capitalism will be with us for a long time**, reforms we win now—raising the minimum wage, securing a national health plan, and demanding passage of right-to-strike **legislation—can bring us closer to socialism**.*

*Straight up commie bullshit on a stick.*

> **Q.** Doesn’t socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?

> **A.** **Democratic socialists do not want to create an all-powerful government bureaucracy** ... While the large concentrations of **capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives**.*

*Double-speak is so so tasty. Doubleplus-yumgood!*

*This is communism. Who the fuck is guiding these ""cooperatives""? Workers? Dream on. We can't even be bothered to vote on major elections and we're gonna be devoting ourselves to this constant demand for feedback? Give me a fucking break. It's going to be centrally planned by an ""elite"" politburo (as always) that will shut down and oppress all future grass roots movements.*",conspiracy,Russia

That's right, NO HUMAN has EVER BEEN higher than **~1000 miles** above sea level... except for that time we ""went to the moon"" which is **240,000 miles** away. And guess what, we did that in 1969! When a computer with the computing power of a TI-89 graphing calculator was the size of a house. We didn't even have DVDs yet. We didn't even have the internet.

Fast foward to today, over 50 years later, when an iphone 12 has more computing power than every single computer on Earth in 1969 COMBINED. Wow! And materials science, engineering, knowledge of physics, space, etc, have all advanced by **50 years!** Nasa has said that we ""lost the technology"" to go to the moon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl1H1WxWTuc). But, how could that be? Even if so, how have we not gone back?

How has China not gone to the moon? How has Russia, or Japan? ""It's too expensive"" people say, but Russia and the CCP spend billions a year on propaganda, would going to the moon not be the most effective propaganda for those countries? China, the only other country than the US to land humans on the moon? Seems like the CCP would greatly benefit from that.

What was done 50 years ago that isn't a thousand times cheaper and easier to do today? You're telling me that we went to the moon in **[this piece of shit](https://imgur.com/a/QbLH8gk)** 50 years ago??? I've seen homeless tents under the highway that have more insulation. I've seen Halloween costumes made out of amazon delivery boxes that look more sturdy than that.

**You're telling me, that no human ever has been further than 1000 miles above sea level, because spaces is so fucking dangerous and deadly, and yet 50 years ago we launched a ""space ship"" that managed to hit a tiny target (relatively speaking) 240,000 miles away... AND GOT IT BACK HOME SAFELY??? A 500,000 MILE ROUND TRIP IN SPACE? PAST THE DEADLY VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELTS THAT WEREN'T EVEN DISCOVERED UNTIL A FEW YEARS AFTER THE ""MOON LANDING""???**

Really, just think about this. In 1969 we sent a tiny homeless tent covered in aluminum foil 250,000 miles away to a precise location... even being 1/10000 of a millimeter off in any part of the launch or duration of the trip would have caused the ship to miss the moon by thousands of miles.... and yet, we can't even get humans past 1000 miles above sea level.

And yes, the ISS is in lower earth orbit. NO MAN has gone past LEO besides that one time we ""went to the moon""",conspiracy,Russia
43,So another war begins......,2448.0,8c5heo,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8c5heo/so_another_war_begins/,504.0,1523682294.0,"
As I read the titles of the news just now, I died inside a little. I won't lie, it hit me right in the heart. They wanted their war and now they have it. The coordinated efforts and nodding heads on all sides make this whole ordeal even worse.

People are in Syria. Real people. People like you and me. Those people are in the middle of this war. They will be killed, tortured, their towns bombed, their country ravaged.

I look at the thread on r/worldnews. I see people making jokes, others nod their heads in agreement. Assad had it coming, right? We need to avenge the children being gassed, right? It's all fair and just, the US and its European allies are doing it in the name of the people, of the Syrians, in the name of freedom......right? And those that disagree are Russian trolls, bots from the Kremlin, Assad's lackeys, child murderers and rapists.

One commenters says: ""Do people here actually believe the reason for the strike is because of moral outrage and wanting to protect the poor civilians? Get real."" another replies, seemingly completely unironically: ""What is it for then?""

Does anyone now, anyone that has looked, truly looked at what's going on, anyone that hasn't been born yesterday, isn't here to push an agenda, troll or provoke and has been witness to the US and their allies' conflicts for the past decades - does any one of those still believe that the US and its allies are doing this in order to save the children? I am genuinely curious - does anyone truly unironically believe that this war is being fucking fought to protect the fucking children from Assad's fucking chemical weapons?!

I've had enough of this shit. Truly, I've had enough. For some reason, for some reason totally beyond me, I thought this wasn't going to happen - not yet at least. But here we are, at the brink of a new major conflict, yet again.

What can we do? What can you do? Why don't we ask ourselves these questions? It's not like we are helpless, it's not like YOU are helpless. If you live in a country that is in this war, you can protest, you can speak out in any way you know how to, you can call your congressman, your representative, you can make your voice heard. Now is not the time to be silent.

Are we going to just mind our own business and let this shit keep going on? Are we going to just keep looking the fucking other way as the entirety of the Middle East gets bombed to kingdom come? When is it going to dawn on people that this is not going to stop with Syria? Do you realize that Iran is likely next? Do you realize what massive casualties a war with Iran would entail? How many trillions more would be spent on those wars? Do you realize that everyone would be affected by extreme fluctuations of oil prices as a result of that war, which could destabilize the economy in its totality?

But ultimately, ultimately - do you really think it will stop with Iran? Do you really think that, if we don't cry out for peace, if we don't make our lives a symbol, an example of peace and empathy and if we don't demand peace on a global scale - do you really think that you, wherever you are, will be safe from the consequences of more and more conflicts? Conflicts with Russia? With China? With anyone labelled an enemy of ""freedom""?

This is not every man for himself anymore. That time has passed if we want to survive as a species. It's time humanity stood its ground and it's time we stand our grand together, not separately anymore. It's time for this shit to stop. People will say it's complicated. No it's not. There is no complication in this. The US and its allies are not the world's police force, they are not here to judge how countries should be governed. If that is the case, shouldn't the US be bombing North Korea first? Shouldn't they be bombing Saudi Arabia for the genocide in Yemen, instead of actually SELLING THEM FUCKING WEAPONS?

I want peace. Not only for the world, for myself as well. For me and the world are not separate. I pledge that I will make deeper and deeper peace in my own life, with those I interact with and those closest to me. That I will move towards deeper peace with all those that I encounter in my life. I will move to become a beacon, an example of this peace, this empathy. I ask you, all of you to do the same. Become peace in your own life and in your interactions with others. 

And as you do so, do not forget about the world. If we cry out for peace, if we demand peace, if we CHOOSE peace, things will change.

 Divided we are weak, yet united we are strong. If we cry out for peace in one voice that voice will be stronger than anything else. That voice can win and change the world.

I wish you all well in this time of insanity and may you all hug those you love the most today and tell them you love them. 

If you are in any way spiritually inclined, pray for the Syrians, pray for the world. At this point, no positive energy is wasted. If that prayer moves you towards any action that may seem of help, so much the better.

I love you all.",conspiracy,Russia
44,Almost $100 Billion Has Been Officially Sent To Ukraine Which Is Around The Amount Of Money Required To End All Poverty In America,2379.0,x1mt2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x1mt2b/almost_100_billion_has_been_officially_sent_to/,415.0,1661875201.0,"The senile adult diaper soiling ice cream eating pedo criminal puppet and his illegitimate administration waging a full spectrum soft war on We the People on behalf of their One World Government handlers has to date gifted nearly $100 billion to the illegitimate CIA-run Ukrainian government.

The official number is staggering, but the shadow books sum is far larger. These funds are primarily being used as CIA black ops money laundering and kickbacks to D.C. politicians and various assets and entities.

Congress is the only government entity that may vote for war. It has not voted for a single war since WW2. Thus, all of the wars since Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and every other war America has been engaged in have all been illegal.

America is currently illegally engaged in a proxy war with Russia. This too is illegal.

Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for even a cent of money to be sent to foreign nations for their wars. This is theft.

The illegitimate Federal government operating out of the foreign nation of Washington, D.C. is illegally stealing the fruits of We the People’s labors via their fraudulent agency known as the IRS. The government does not need this money. No matter what percent of taxes is stolen, the government is equally as insolvent and spending at a similar rate.

Taxation is nothing more than [social engineering](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/original-social-engineering-sin) to control and ultimately prematurely murder Americans.

For some perspective on the more recent crime sprees of this fraudulent and sociopathic “government”:

* $100 billion dollars distributed to poor Americans would more or less eradicate poverty\*
* $100 billion dollars distributed to homeless Americans would more or less eradicate homelessness\*
* the $80 billion recently allocated to the unconstitutional IRS and their new army of armed goons that have no [legal powers](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/memorandum-of-law-the-legality-of) to steal direct un-apportioned monies via “taxes” (i.e. “income” taxes) from Americans would eradicate most if not all poverty and/or homelessness in America\*.

Let that sink in: $80 billion stolen from you to fund more theft from you that simultaneously steals away productive GDP and as such decimates the main economic driving forces. The middle class and poor will become poorer thanks to the money that was stolen from them in the first place. Talk about a viciously depraved and wholly unconstitutional feedback loop.

But alas, this latest IRS scam serves to reinforce the WEF and UN Great Reset agenda perfectly, because this illegitimate government is only beholden to the One World Government which necessitates the destruction of the American populace it pretends to serve. The $100 billion in Ukrainian “war” money is just their fuck you money slush fund that is also being used indirectly and directly against We the People.

The only way to survive this criminally out of control government is to offer total nonviolent noncompliance in every facet of our lives. This must be done en masse, and done now.

Do NOT comply.

>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.

>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.

>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.

>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.

>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”

>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.

>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”

>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.

>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”

>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.

>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.

>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”

>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.

>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.

>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”

>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.

>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.

>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.

>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”

>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).

>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”

>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?

>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.

>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.

>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.

>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”

>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.

>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”

>Correction: February 18, 2018
>An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.

49,NYTimes gets called out on Twitter by Wikileaks for having a long history of knowingly conspiring with intelligence communities and having paid agents on their staff.,2168.0,akjep6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/akjep6/nytimes_gets_called_out_on_twitter_by_wikileaks/,329.0,1548646394.0,"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1089273399808061450?s=21

NYTimes: Could the Trump campaign really not have known that in dealing with WikiLeaks it was dealing with Russia?

Wikileaks: Not even the US government alleges such nonsense, NYT. However, it has long been shown that the New York Times and its owners knowingly conspired with intelligence agencies and accepted paid intelligence officers on its staff using journalism as cover. http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php",conspiracy,Russia
50,You do not have to be a Trump supporter to believe that the Russian collusion thing was all made up. You can just be a lover of truth and see through the manipulations. To what end? Who ordered the lies? That is the stuff for a conspiracy subreddit.,2136.0,b4vijy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b4vijy/you_do_not_have_to_be_a_trump_supporter_to/,1052.0,1553428105.0,"So I was reading through the other post from Greenwald, who I agree with. But it was devolving into a political fight rather than an exploration of the real conspiracy behind this. 

If there was no Russian collusion, why was there an investigation? What was the purpose of the investigation? Who ordered and supplied the media with lies to report because it does not seem that they were reporting facts?

It appears that we are on the other side of this now. It was a failed manipulation of the masses. Maybe they actually thought they would get something on Trump, but then it wasn't there. 

This does not mean that one has to agree with Trump. Dispose of that false dichotomy. Even Greenwald doesn't support Trump. 

Edited to add that I'm willing to accept apologies from the jerks who were rude about the report not being released yet.

CNN says there was no collusion: https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/robert-mueller-report-summary/index.html

WaPo says the same. Current headline because they won't let me link to a specific page. ""Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, attorney general says""

And one we all need to unite on. Let me start by focusing on you, the person reading this. I want to say, from a complete internet stranger that I love you and I want the best for you. Because you are another aspect of myself, and deserve love and safety just as much as I do. You are my fellow man, and I do not care what skin color you have as you read these words or what view points of reality you have. You are a brother. You are a sister. We are a family. We are a human family. We are a creative powerful species capable of amazing feats when we come together. We bicker, we fight. We struggle, we compete. We survive. We do what we must in a world ripe with negativity. But in the end, when everything settles, creative light and love are at the core of who we are. We are meant to love one another, not hurt each other. We have the potentials for so much abundance for all, but a select group of power thirsty power over others, service to self group of psychopaths are not satisfied with what they have and always seek more. This is what greed is. Truly advanced technologies that could benefit all of mankind, suppressed because it would put these ""elites"" out of control and power. We no longer need to call them elite, for they are not. They are scum of the earth and are in direct harm to mankind itself and wish nothing more than for us to destroy ourselves while they laugh on the side lines.

These are the powers that were. The cabal. The Illuminati. The Shadow Government. Names come and go, but their dark tentacles linger in the shadows.

Their gig is up. Their time is over. The show is up for them and they know it. This is a Spiritual Play of Cosmic proportions and we are all actors in one giant awakening and remembering of divine consciousness and remembrance of what and who we are. Their negativity, control, fear, and war has done a toll on this earth, but it also back fired on them. When you go so far into the darkness, it only makes it that much easier to snap back into the light. We have been held in a dark quagmire for so long, have felt the emptiness of what dark truly is, and have made our collective choice to wake the fuck up and move the fuck on from this barbaric system we have constructed. Total chaos it may look like to all of us looking at reality right now. The truth is, change is always happening, and for a new reality that we all collectively want to happen, all old negative belief systems of control and patterns must break down. I have posted many times about the Mayan Calendar and how the 2012 end times scare was truly a new birth of consciousness for man kind. A golden age of consciousness if you will. This has been heavily documented and researched and has been a pretty interesting topic of discussion. 

You may ask where I am going with all of this. What I am leading up to. When you make the personal choice to start finding the truth of our reality, things happen. Synchronicity, Mandela Effect, Law of Attraction, Numerology. You begin to notice patterns and realize things are a lot more connected than you realize and there is a hidden world all around us that we cannot see.

I love quoting Nikola Tesla to make a comparison for this. 

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.""

We all exist on a certain frequency or wave length. Our bodies are dialed into this third dimensional time frame of existence. We all resonate to this frequency, thus we are all in tune with each other and the third dimension itself. If you have heard of Mass Consciousness, it ties into this. This is why group meditations can be so powerful. 

Now, think about if you truly knew the truth of our reality, and could manipulate that global consciousness to your own will. Like a few Border Collies slowly leading a group of sheep in a direction. I hate using the sheep analogy but I hope I am providing a picture for you here. 

Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let's others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others. The Law of One is what this understanding is. Because we are behind a veil of amnesia, and do not truly know or remember everything we have experienced, it makes this illusionary reality seem ""real"" it makes it seem like you are your body and nothing more. It makes it so easy to think and believe that. I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.

This is where this all takes a dark, dark, turn. Some people think God is a fairy tale. That is all fine and dandy. But there is a legitimate group of people. These 8,000 - 8,5000 people believe that Lucifer is God and that he is the true light. They Rebel against creation itself and attack, control, destroy it. 

A lot of them are luciferians. Some are Satanists. The thing is, this all boils down to Zionism. A long, long, deep rooted system of beliefs that has permeated mankinds existence even since the biblical times and has been documented in the Bible. The Israelites being casted away to Babylon. 

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

This brings me to my next horrid truth of reality. ""Satanic"" Sex Rings. The inspiration for this post comes from the repeated comments I see of people saying ""Satanic Sex Rings are Fake"" and ""Satanic Panic all over again""

There is a reason these tales exist in the first place. And I am going to provide proof to you that this world is run, and controlled, by these 8,000 - 8,500, and how they use Satanic Sex Rings, MKUltra Monarch Mind Control, to Split victims personalities. And how blackmail is collected on people wishing to get into power structures or into ""the top of the pyramid"" where access is only given to those that allow themselves to be taped having sex with kids. Or worse...  This is dark stuff, but it needs to be discussed. This is how these 8,000 - 8,500 psychopaths run the world, and also gives them protection from Good people trying to go after them because they ultimately control key positions of power and prevent investigations from going forth. This is why they hate awareness. This is why they hate Unity.

Divide and conquer is their favorite tool. Get your enemy distracted fighting themselves, and they are less of a threat to your own agenda.

Get mankind so hateful towards itself, towards the ""other"" persons skin color and sexual orientation of preference. They stand no chance to take you down when we are busy dividing ourselves.

This is their bread and butter. This is why we have share blue. Why we attract trolls and shills. This is why astroturfing exists. This is why you can follow the money and find out the truth. If you control the world, you control the money. If you control the money, you control the people. If you control the people, you control the world. You control media, you control Big Pharma, you control access to technology. You set up this big ploy of Russia vs United states then while the citizens of both countries are scared and fighting each other, the powers that were sit in the stands laughing and cheering as fellow man destroy themselves, completely oblivious to the spectators looking on and instigating us.

This game is rigged folks. This reality is controlled. The chains have moved from the physical to the spiritual.

This is the big conspiracy. This is where it all leads to.

Please. Watch these videos. Educate yourself. Bring awareness and light to this subject. Drop seeds of truth here and there with friends and family. Look for the truth and you will find it because the truth is within us. The moment you look outside yourself for the truth that is the moment you confirm you do not have the truth. Always truth your own intuition. Your own awareness and gut feelings. 

Let's come together as one, as we truly are. And free this world from the shackles that it has been placed in for thousands of years. I implore you, a fellow human, to please ponder these things and find a way to help in your own manner. We can stop this TODAY if we collectively chose to do so.

Anytime someone says pedophile rings do not exist, link them to this thread. Share these videos and links with them. Let them come to their conclusion and realize that this is indeed happening. Some will refuse. The more mankind awakens, the further some will create lies to continue their safe reality they have created for themselves. This is fine. We cannot push judgments or opinions as we all have our own way of viewing reality and if people wish to remain ignorant to the truth, that is their choice to do so.

We do not need to waste energy attacking each other anymore. Pushing opniions and trying to create a i am right you are wrong scenario only further divides us and builds ego and fills our heads. I have been guilty of it countless times and will be the first to admit that we all make mistakes and I have given in to emotions more times than I can count. It is time we take responsibility for our actions and realize the consequences of the choices we sometimes choose to make. Mistakes are bound to happen and we need to use them as a learning tool instead of a thing we need to avoid at all costs.

Here are some hard hitting links regarding these rings, as well as various personal testimony from woman that have survived sexual abuse torture and trafficking and other horrid cruel things. This needs awareness. These links do not all pertain to International Pedophile rings but shine light and give context where need be. Feel free to copy this whole post if you wish and share it. No need to give credit.

The mod team is honored to announce another in our continuing series of AMA (ask me anything) sessions on the subreddit.

For this round, our guest will be NSA Whistleblower William Binnney (verified via /u/WilliamBinney) and the AMA will take place on Thursday, August 27th, at Noon eastern time.

Mr. Binney was kind enough to provide photo verification for this AMA which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/F1IHym8).

This AMA is of particular interest as Mr. Binney's AMA earlier this week-on another subreddit-[was censored mid way through his scheduled time slot.](https://twitter.com/Burke4Senate/status/1298318463610560512?s=20)

For those unaware;

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA)[4] and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.

>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. 

>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).

>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

As to the issue of the 2016 DNC hack, Mr. Binney has the following to say in the text of [his initial (censored) AMA](https://archive.is/RMhh3);

>Remember when emails released by Wikileaks proved that the DNC rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders? And everyone claimed that the Russians had hacked the DNC?

>There's only one problem. There was no hack.

>It was an internal leak.

>Here's my proof

>It boils down to these three key points:

>1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

>2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

>3.)The NSA would've known the hack was taking place, thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied

>In October 2017, at the specific request of President Donald Trump, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at that time CIA Director, and presented my evidence that the ""Russian hack"" never was. Did Trump ever receive that evidence?

>So, Ask me anything!

(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2 will help you clarify who is who.)


King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  


Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things.""

That officer believed there were “no limitations” on his activities, the report said, because he was on an unpaid leave of absence, and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A. Another embedded C.I.A. analyst — who was on its payroll — said he was given 'unfiltered' police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence, the C.I.A. report said."" https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html (http://archive.is/yKwIa)

- Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.
Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.
With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.
You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""
""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.
Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.
You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.
This all happened in the country where I live.
You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.
Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?
Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?
I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.
I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.",conspiracy,Russia

I'm not here to fear monger but this is clearly a sign of the times, it is clear that the worlds population, OUR WORLDS population is not standing for the bullshit anymore. 

I'm making this post because many of these massive protests have not gotten enough press and many of us are not aware of everything that's going on. 

I believe it's way past time to prepare ourselves for what lies ahead. Without a doubt the events that will happen throughout the world in 2020-2030 will be seriously different than the previous decades before it. It's time to prepare ourselves for any kind of outcome.

This includes stock piling food, ammunition, and just preparing ourselves and our families in general for what lies ahead. 

Without a doubt we can get through anything that occurs, but we need to be prepared. So please take the time to research what it means to be a ""prepper"" and let's get through this together. 

But the most important thing we can remember is that you and I, our friends, our neighbors are not and can not become enemies. We need to work together to get through anything that lies ahead, and there's no doubt we can as long as we remember who we are as humans and stick together.

I’m only doing this because I care about humanity, my future, my children’s future, oppressed people around the globe, and really the survival of our species in a time when more money and resources is dedicated to weaponry and AI/Tech than ever before.

The first rule you need to know is conspiracy theorist was a weaponized term by the CIA to make people fall in line, and ridicule anyone who opposed the status quo narrative. Politicians LOVE this term, because it enables their goals while simultaneously encouraging you to mock anyone who speaks out.

The second rule is everything you have heard regarding conspiracies, while it contains falsehoods, is relatively true in one way or another. This is just a Reddit post intended to point you in the right direction so I won’t make a super in depth post but I encourage all to do their due diligence and research these subjects, as I’ve learned it’s the only way the majority will reach *the truth* anyways. 

Freemasonry, CIA, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, United Nations, Vatican, FBI, NSA, Mossad, M16, Federal Reserve, CCP, etc.

Learn right now that there are people in this world so powerful they influence everything you see and hear on a daily basis. The hardest part to accepting this all, is like The Matrix Movie on a tiny scale. Everything is fake, manufactured, planned, and coordinated. 


“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812).

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions) 

Bush = evil. Clinton = evil. Obama = evil. Older Bush = evil.   HERES the difference.. Trump = somewhat disrespectful idiot who is not a career politician or ties to public office (senate/house/president/VP) but actually likes America and opposes the Globalist agenda. 

Twitter is compromised. Reddit is compromised. Facebook is compromised. Even this sub = compromised. Operation Mockingbird is in full effect every day in here to sway public opinion. ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people. 

“I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.” - Harry S Truman, President of the United States.

Love yourself. Love your neighbor. Love and peace is the only thing that can conquer all. Educate yourself. Educate others. Understand atheism is a carefully crafted lie to make you believe this is all there is to life. Understand we have a purpose. There is more than meets the eye in this materialistic and corporatist society we currently inhabit, and all truths will eventually rise to the surface. Don’t lose faith.

Edit: to understand how this sub is compromised, look at almost every top comment. It’s not discussing the material, or the main parts of what’s being implied here, but rather every comment is nitpicking anything I said about Trump, and only Trump. In my original post, I claim Trump is a bad person. An imbecile. Can’t say a speech to save his life. Disrespectful. Just a non intelligent human being. Nor does he do honorable things like release tax returns or present real forward thinking ideas or policies. I end it with acknowledging *no matter what candidate takes office the next 4 years will be hell.* However, the shill crowd immediately comes in and glosses over the MAIN parts of what I’m saying here, which is conspiracy theories related to government and politics are for the most part true, to research agencies and institutions that contribute to the stripping of your rights in modern day propaganda in broad daylight, especially the CIA.",conspiracy,Russia
73,"Our entire Solar System is changing rapidly, but nobody is talking about it",1714.0,zi9kxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/zi9kxm/our_entire_solar_system_is_changing_rapidly_but/,703.0,1670721365.0,"All the major bodies of our Solar System are changing rapidly, but nobody is talking about it.  We are seeing rapid observable changes to almost every single planet:

1. Pluto's atmosphere has recently collapsed
2. Neptune's storms have suddenly begun rotating backwards
3. Uranus' polar regions are visibly flaring
4. Jupiter has recently experienced a 700 degree temperature impulse originating from its northern pole, and its great red spot is fading
5. Mars is suddenly displaying seismic activity
6. Our own polar regions have warmed drastically recently, the amount of volcanic activity we are seeing is at an all-time high
7. Venus's planetary winds have increased their velocity by 33% in the last 20 years

It goes on from there, we've recently observed:

1. large-scale changes in the ice cover on Jupiter’s moon Europa
2. large-scale changes in the polar ice cap on Mars
3. a large-scale decrease in atmospheric pressure on Venus
4. a mysterious brightening of the atmosphere of Saturn
5. a mysterious darkening of the atmosphere of Venus
6. unusual changes in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere of Neptune
7. a brightening of the atmosphere of Jupiter
8. a mysterious dark spot near the South Pole of Venus

Here on earth, our own magnetosphere is rapidly losing it's strength as our magnetic poles continue to race away from their usual positions, wreaking havoc on animal migrations - see all the beached whales this year as well as the spike in reports of unusual bird sightings.

Things have gotten to the point where we are now updating our magnetic models yearly, and soon there will be zones of flux broken bad enough to cause real danger to flying due to constant magnetic reconnection.

Our aurorae are reaching levels of intensity not normally seen, with recent  high-energy'pink' aurorae being observed.

The fundamental electromagnetic nature of this planet - electromagnetism responsible for a variety of effects on life, most especially cardiac and pulmonary health in humans humans, is changing rapidly.

Volcanic activity on our planet is currently at a record, with more and more volcanoes showing concerning lift, erupting, or showing increases in lava flow. Every single active volcano along the pacific rim is showing increased activity. Mount Rainier looks ready soon. The Sisters in Oregon are showing lift - and then there's volcano mama herself, Yellowstone, showing signs of increasing rumbling.

Given only one of two data points, it woulud be easy to discount the events as isolated and unrelated outliers with no significance.

Taken together, however, the total body of evidence becomes impossible to ignore, and, once the presumption is made that this information is known by our leaders, pretty much explains the motivations for their actions.

Everything is changing. Nobody is telling you. In fact, they built us a world where these questions are taboo, where every answer leads you away from the glaring, obvious truth.

“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”   William Casey, former director of the CIA, upon being asked what the goal of the agency was (in 1981).

75,Additional 11-Pages of FBI Documents Unsealed – Biggest Surprise: President Obama Implicated…,1693.0,j06rd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j06rd7/additional_11pages_of_fbi_documents_unsealed/,622.0,1601129702.0,"This afternoon Judge Emmet Sullivan unsealed an additional 11-pages of documents showing more background information about how the FBI was targeting former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn.  \[[Court pdf Here](https://t.co/W1M33J49Tf?amp=1)\]  Also [embedded](https://www.scribd.com/document/459199066/us-v-flynn) below.

The release today is even more revealing than the handwritten notes released last night; and specifically President Obama’s “by the book” statement on January 5, 2017, takes on an entirely new light.  They may not realize it yet, but this release implicates Obama.

Within [the release](https://t.co/W1M33J49Tf?amp=1) we discover an “Electronic Communication” or “EC” from the Washington FBI field office recommending to close the FBI investigation of General Flynn on January 4, 2017, due to “no derogatory information.” However, FBI Agent Peter Strzok immediately responds to the FBI team \[main headquarters\] saying: “don’t do it yet’… and the plot unfolds.

There are FBI codenames within the release that need some explanation prior to review:

* **Crossfire Hurricane** (CH) is the overall investigation that began in July 2016
* **Crossfire Typhoon** (CT) is George Papadopoulos.
* **Crossfire Razor** (CR) is Michael Flynn.
* **Cross Wind** is still unknown. \[Could be a person, or a subset of the case\]

Let’s take a walk through the information starting with the FBI electronic communication.

First it is valuable to note three points from the first page:

1. “DOJSCO” – The Special Counsel Office had this information from the outset.  That means everyone in/around the Mueller investigation already knew this information.  That also means that Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein was aware of it.
2. Pay close attention to the dates.  This EC was written on January 4, 2017.  Dates are critical.  When you compare the text messages and emails from Peter Strzok and other participants always refer to the dates to tell the big story.
3. Note the framework for the investigation itself was centered around Michael Flynn violating FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) laws based on a fraudulent premise of Flynn working for Russian interests.  The FBI using FARA is a critical point.  FARA was used as the primary justification by the DOJ and FBI for all political surveillance.

The FBI Washington Field Office says they are going to close the investigation of General Flynn because there is **no derogatory information** as a result of multiple investigative inquires:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ofl7jrq2ip51.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a58a3ff1f0b200849bbf26468b1ebd5615eab85

The EC document then describes their work with Confidential Human Source (CHS) Stefan Halper.  Interestingly, Halper lied to the FBI and told them he had attended an event with Michael Flynn in Moscow and was a direct eye-witness.  “During the debriefing the CTH relayed an incident s/he witnessed”…. Halper never attended the Moscow event; he lied to the FBI.

https://preview.redd.it/j16i4ffv2ip51.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4a4d3d73d1b2b9ad9c50bce15e5e38b7a62bbf2

The EC notes the FBI is closing this investigation.  However, Peter Strzok goes bananas and immediately starts texting FBI officials to keep the investigation open….

https://preview.redd.it/btbelbgz2ip51.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ea6c16cd786da0c5d06cde097a31dd17d7262b9a

Which leads to a 2:22pm message where Peter Strzok notes “7th floor involved”.  That means FBI Director James Comey is now engaged on the issue.

James Comey being actively engaged is important.  Previously Comey said he was unaware of what they were doing…  Additionally this text and activity is January 4, 2017.

The very next day, January 5th, James Comey goes to the White House for a meeting with President Obama and Vice-President Biden.

January 5th is [the White House meeting](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2019/11/29/the-mysteriously-redacted-paragraph-700-days-since-lindsey-graham-outlined-susan-rice-cya-memo-and-dc-doesnt-want-answers/) where National Security Advisor Susan Rice, FBI Director James Comey (Crossfire Hurricane), and Deputy AG Sally Yates (Flynn FARA) are talking to President Obama about the status of the Flynn FBI investigation and President Obama says “by the book”.

**SIDEBAR on THIS ISSUE**: This long forgotten [letter](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161) from Susan Rice’s lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler (who was also the former White House Counsel to President Obama).  Notice that in Ruemmler’s letter she specifically says the January 5th meeting was about Flynn:

>*\[*[*Feb 23, 2018*](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161)*\] The memorandum to file drafted by Ambassador Rice memorialized an important national security discussion between President Obama and the FBI Director and the Deputy Attorney General. President Obama and his national security team were justifiably concerned about potential risks to the Nation’s security from sharing highly classified information about Russia with certain members of the Trump transition team,* ***particularly Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn****.*  
*\[…\] While serving as National Security Advisor, Ambassador Rice was not briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and she later learned of the fact of this investigation from Director Comey’s subsequent public testimony.*  
*(*[*Reummler Letter*](https://www.scribd.com/document/372258161/Susan-Rice-Response-to-Grassley-Graham)*)*

How could Ms. Susan Rice be aware of a “national security compromise”, “particularly surrounding Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn” after a “briefing by the FBI”, if she was “not briefed on the existence of an FBI investigation”?  With all of this information, these stories are falling apart.

79,Massive Propaganda Push Re. Syria Gas Attack,1634.0,8aox4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8aox4n/massive_propaganda_push_re_syria_gas_attack/,522.0,1523179348.0,"There is a [thread currently trending](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8amk7l/150_dead_in_syria_gas_attack_rescuers_say/) about the most recent Syrian gas attack and I can't really tell if its populated by people with a serious deficiency in critical and analytical thought or whether its a deliberate attempt to control the narrative. However, after reading more comments than I ever want to repeat I have to assume this is a coordinated effort.

Looking at whats indisputably clear about the situation:

1. There appears to have been a gas attack targeting civilians in Syria.

2. If true, it constitutes a war crime.

3. There has been no investigation and no evidence exists to assign responsibility.


There are a great many tangents this could take in terms of discussing who was responsible for past gas attacks in Syria, suffice to say there was a massive effort by Western governments to link them to the Syrian government and thus provide legitimation for greater direct intervention.

Given this there are a few extra points that are very clear:

1. The Syrian Government was very clearly winning the military conflict by a wide-margin.

2. Even the US is very clear in admitting the Syrian Government is not fighting against 'rebels' but against IS and Al Qaeda offshoots.

3. These latter groups are equally open about their willingness to target civilians and have no qualms about slaughtering women and children. Whether the Syrian Government can be accused of similar crimes is a matter of debate, with the terrorist groups it is established fact.

4. Despite this, the Syrian Government has repeatedly, and very recently, offered ceasefires that allowed these same terrorist fighters (and their families) to leave areas in which they were surrounded and almost certain to be overrun.

5. The Syrian Government would have nothing at all to gain from using gas in the manner of the recent attack. It would generate no strategic military benefits, it would turn the civilian population against the government (bear in mind, the majority of the Syrian people, even the ones who dislike Assad, support the government as a far better alternative to power falling into the hands of the terrorist groups, most of whom came from outside Syria), and most importantly it might allow Western States to take military action that would be the only factor capable of changing the course of the conflict in a way that would benefit the terrorist groups.

6. In contrast, the terrorist groups have every reason to carry out such attacks. Their ideology justifies any sacrifice as long as it furthers their cause and they have displayed a wanton disregard for any form of human life. They have long had access (through both Turkey and early seized Syrian Army stockpiles) to chemical weapons. And, they now have only months if not weeks left before their entire war in Syria grinds to a halt.

Despite the above, the thread originally linked is dominated by comments that do three specific things:

1. Condemn Assad and the Syrian government for the attacks (with many suggesting it demands a strong military response).

2. Calling out an imaginary Russian bot campaign they say is promoting pro-Assad propaganda DESPITE the fact that the thread is clearly overflowing with exactly the opposite type of voice.

3. Denigrating (by means of Poisoning the Well, Ad Hominem and Appeals to Ridicule) a wide variety of alternative news sites and sources. For example, claiming that sites which have supported 9/11 Truth, or are in any way pro-Russia are automatically discredited and incapable of providing relevant information.


The reason I'm posting this is that the thread in question is one of the most glaring, and frankly depressing, examples I've seen of people taking a mainstream narrative and attempting to preemptively crush any and all dissenting views.

My one hope is that the majority of voices in that thread are deliberately manufacturing this attempt at framing the narrative. Because the alternative, that they represent the actual opinions of members of the voting public whose otherwise neutral viewpoints have been so easily swayed by propaganda of the most crude and blunt form, is unbelievably disheartening in regard to the viability of modern democracies and the ability of alternative news to help promote a better understanding of the complexities of modern war and the dangers involved in mainstream media efforts to reduce these issues to puppet-shows populated with morally black (Assad, Putin) and white ('rebel activists', the White Helmets) characters.",conspiracy,Russia

At the Nuremberg Trials, as the Nazis were examined and tried for their war crimes, Nazi Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering said the following.

Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

These 3 quotes together explain an awful lot. They also highlight the fact that the main battle is actually authoritarians vs anti-authoritarians. Those who want to control or be controlled, and those who don't want to get involved with all that. The anti-authoritarians are split across different political parties so they have reduced unity and therefore reduced impact on the people in control. The government is largely a shield for the military and for industry to hide behind while they start wars and gain power over people. Government waxes and wanes between being for ""We the people"" or being for the greedy megalomaniacs, it has all throughout history. We're at a bad point in history in regards to this, and I wonder when the pendulum will begin to swing the other way. ",conspiracy,Russia

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWNXneUrMY&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWNXneUrMY&t=1s)

I can go into how we were happily living under a secular democratic system for a short period of time after centuries of having a Kingdom and a dictator to rule us. I always wonder what could we achieve if we didn’t have oil, or if Musaddegh wasn’t as honorable as he was and would have become a friend to the west, negotiating on a deal that would have worked for both sides, even more for the US. I have pride but I would have wanted a good relation with the west even if that meant selling out our assets/resources to a foreign country for cheaper because the alternative has been misery for the majority of Iranians, especially in the last 15 years.

What I know is that we had a secular system, with laws based on humanity and ethics not some guy's book from 1400 years ago who wasn’t even a Persian. Musaddegh didn’t sell out, he was toppled and Shah was installed. Shah did great things economically which in itself is a whole story but there were still many people living in poverty who didn’t like Shah living lavishly like a KING when they could barely afford a roof over their head.

He also oppressed religious minorities to some extent, banned headscarf and persecuted activists. Anyhow he fucked up and people believed and fell for right wing promise of a religious (and secular at the same time!) Mulla revolution that will bring oil money to everyone’s table, people, not only the ones in charge!

People believed in him, Khomeini, and it turned out his promise was a lie. The opposite happened. No one except the people in charge has seen any of that oil money in the past 4 decades

I come from a small town where all schools, hospital, roads, pipeline, and basically every bit of infrastructure are built by donations from a few wealthy and generous people we have.

Some facts that are barely discussed in English speaking forums. Like how 80-90% of people working for the regime and more important politicians have dual nationalities along with their spouses and kids. MANY from the US and Europe.

Ali Larijani who is the speaker of the Parliment, very anti American(politics)and also happens to  be the Leader Khamenei’s son in Law, has a daughter who lives in Ohio and has finished her medical school there. So you see in the case of a war, almost none of them are gonna get hurt. Their families will be out of Iran in matter of days.

On the recent news and incident.

I have not seen many people in the west describing the situation in Iran correctly. Why? Well one because they are right to not believe the MSM and government’s narrative but none are talking to actual Iranians directly, neither pro Trump nor anti war people in the west.

Don't take me and my stats for my word. What I have said or am saying could be asked from any Iranian. You can find hundreds of us on social media and more than a few know how to communicate basic messages in English. Just talk to them. I would suggest visiting our country to get the truth but at this time I don’t recommend it at all. Unless you are an activist. But it is still risky because you can’t really report the whole truth from there. The government would only allow half of it ( the part people being angry at the west, not the entire reality and the majority being angry at the government)

Pro government people are mourning his death and anti government people (the majority) are not. I can't say what percentages of Iranians are unhappy with the government but I know for a fact that we are in the majority, well over 70% if you ask me. Among the younger generation, which are the majority of Iranians that number is well above 90%.

If these numbers seem irrational and unrealistic, look up and read the US's congress and Senate's approval rating. It isn't any better.

The anti government portion is more worry of the possibility of a war because they don't wanna die for a system they despise while pro government people are expecting demand a retaliation.

98% of people in the west are looking at this as it is a black or white situation while this couldn't be any grayer.

Soleimani was fighting isis in Iraq (in itself a good thing ) in a war that again, the majority of Iranians don't support. Iran’s alliance in Syria is of a diplomatic nature not based on humanity or saving people from isis or whatever.

Soleimani was also the guy in charge of repressing anti government protest in Iran for decades, including 2008 uprising over a rigged election ( it was actually funny how rigged it was but they still got away with it). Thousands of protesters were gunned down under his command. The protests about three months ago over gas prices hiking up also resulted in over 500 deaths. The sad part is both the left, right nor independent channels I watch and follow really reported on this topic.

If a war breaks out, the true victims of this situation are without a doubt the majority of Iranians, getting screwed by both the Iranian regime and US government, just as we are now.

The sanctions don’t hurt the rich or the government. It hurts the middle class and poor which consist the majority of Iranians.

Living expense has increased 3, 4 folds, while wages have doubled at max. Property value/rent has risen almost anywhere from 5-10 times, in response to our currency tanking over sanctions. The poor has become extremely poor and the middle class has become poor while the wealthy which owns property and materials like cars have become millionaires and the multi millionaires even wealthier!

The cheapest (one of the shittiest available) car made in Iran, Kia Pride, (a newer version an old Kia Pride model) goes for 70 M toman brand new. The same car was 6 million a decade ago. I remember it being 6 million since I was a kid and …. That’s where we are after 10 years of sanctions.

Ok I will end this rant now

Neither pro war nor anti war people in the US are right on their report of the situation.

pro war people:

Soleimani is bad (true but not for the reason they say. Edit: This is what I mean. I don't believe he was going to harm Any American or as they say was involved in ""an imminent threat."" I think Neocons wanted a provocation with Iran for a long time and ... .

 I've read the majority of American death attributed to him are from Iraq war time, 10 years ago. I believe he was capable of doing a lot of bad shit, or has done in the past and wish him and all criminals like him could face a judge and jury!  I just don't buy into what Pompeo and Trump say like I never liked Obama and Biden/Hillary.

This video is also very telling.

 I remember watching this live like it was yesterday.

""I don't like Assad at all but Assad is killing isis. Russia is killing isis and Iran is killing isis!"" Trump 2016""

@ 1:25

And now suddenly Pompeo and Trump say he was the baddest guy in the world? Why didn't they go after him in 2009,10... Every crime he is accused of comitting, Killing protesters in Iran and Americans in Iraq dates back to 2000s. 

&#x200B;

Iran government bad (true, but is US government doing anyone any good?)

95% want government gone: not really that high. Unfortunately US's response and actions has given government more support no matter how much they suck. Trump killing Soleimani this way pushes people who are in the middle to the government’s side. So will a war. Saddam’s invasion with West’s “go ahead and blessing” only made the recently won revolution more popular, so will a war waged against a despised regime and forcing people to fight for a system that has oppressed them all their life, taking away the basic freedom and choices a human deserves.

I’d like to believe the regime doesn’t have more than 20% supports but I don’t have a number on that. It is hard to conduct independent surveys with the limited freedoms of speech and press we have. if you live among Iranians, it won’t take you more than a week to realize the majority want a total reform.

\-90% would love us to bomb them!(false). Like I said, the Iranian civilians will pay the highest cost for that war. Looking at our neighbors, they don’t seem to be better off than they were before US’s invasion.

Anti war people:

\-Soleimani was good (false. Fighting isis doesn't make him a good guy! He wasn't fighting them to defend his people, for a good cause even though he believed that. Iran’s fight against ISIS has nothing to do with what the majority of Iranians wanted).

\-Iran government good: (false) Not all of them are pushing this narrative. Secular talk and Kim Iverson on youtube have both correctly reported that Iranians are very unhappy with their government. Yet 95% of the left, anti war voices on the right and independents who are calling out Trump on this ignore this part. I know why they are doing it though. One you agree with the CIA’s talking point that X is a bad guy, then they say “well we have to do something about it don’t we?” and many people with good intentions would think that’s the right thing to do! Manufacturing consent I suppose it is called. Or maybe I’m wrong. But in this case, the bad guy is really bad! I’m upset they don’t say it but what I care more is me, my relatives and my compatriots not getting bombed. So I’m thankful to every anti war voice on the left, right and independent, even if they are reporting what goes on inside Iran not accurately.

\-The majority don't want a war (true!) I don’t think this needs an explanation.

I'm personally not saddened even for a bit over Soleimani’s death news, but the possibility of a war has made me quit worry. I’ve always been afraid of war. Not dying in it but surviving it while many of the people I know and care for don't.

My numbers are my opinions and what I perceive. I encourage everyone to their own research on the things they can find online and talk to Iranians, the one who live in Iran, if you want to know how they feel about this situation! You will find many people angry at the government who would love anything, including a war, as oppose to the current situation but the majority don't want a war.

I’d like to leave it with a positive note which is a fact. Americans are probably the most liked  nationality for Iranians. Again I encourage all you to watch Peter’s video on Iran. Take his word for it not mine

For me personally, the most welcoming and warm people I have met in my life have been Americans and I have lived a few countries.

This war isn’t between us, the people, but sadly it is us who have to fight the wars.

Forgive my grammar, spelling and poor writing skills.

If you really  did read all of it, you really do give a shit. Thanks!

* Europe is buying natural gas from their sworn enemy, Russia
* The US is accusing other counties of creating WMDs
* I'm being told to enjoy $5 gas because it makes an $80,000 electric car seem more affordable
* Press Secretary Jen Psaki, released a video where she's directing US energy policy, despite zero oil industry experience
* Kamala Harris laughed in Poland when asked about plans for helping Ukrainian refugees escape war (a somewhat serious topic)
* Joe Biden hosted a ""key"" meeting with 30 TikTok influencers (VIPs)
* Actor Sean Penn  tried negotiating fighter jet sales to Poland
* Car maker Elon Musk challenged President Putin to a fight, while wagering land he doesn't own
* A $1.5 trillion bill was passed at 2:30AM
* A war in Europe cured a pandemic in North America
* Mortgage interest rates are less than the rate of inflation
* Ugly cartoon NFT art, is the best performing investment class... ever

95,"The reaction to the news that US troops are coming home from Syria and Afghanistan has been stunning to behold. TPTB/MSM have a significant portion of the population drowning in cognitive dissonance, conditioned to support the genocidal ambitions of the military industrial complex.",1461.0,a8azj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/a8azj4/the_reaction_to_the_news_that_us_troops_are/,353.0,1545405818.0,"I've never seen anything like this.

Just like how TPTB blinded people with ""hope"" during the Obama administration, they are similarly blinding folks with ""hate"" over Trump, which almost completely prevents a rational dialogue about these issues from taking place.

The Mockingbird MSM has unabashedly fallen victim to these morbid obsessions, as their hatred for Trump and their obsession with Russia is causing them to lose all credibility on the world stage.

For example, when discussing the news about troop withdrawal from Syria, NPR was aggressively spinning this story as ""making Putin very happy"" and ""being fantastic for Putin.""

When someone (a caller or guest) expressed doubt about this, the host, exasperated, said something like ""but, but...someone heard Putin say he was happy!""

NPR should be ashamed of themselves for perpetrating these Mockingbird Media narratives. Here's Putin's *actual* response:

[Putin says ""I do generally agree with the President of the United States.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA10hspHG-w)

According to the NPR ""news"" story, I was expected Putin to be cackling with glee. He's not.

Here's the crazy thing: If Putin *really* is trying to cause destabilization in the US, he's doing a piss poor job compared to the Mockingbird MSM.

To NPR and these other ""news"" outlets: STOP TALKING ABOUT PUTIN. YOU ARE GIVING HIM THE PLATFORM THAT HE WANTS.

Who *cares* what Putin thinks?? Stop inserting him into *every* story. You are fostering and perpetuating bona fide xenophobia and should be ashamed of yourselves.

I would imagine that it strokes his ego on a *daily* basis to see such hysterics from the Western media apparatus (same with Trump!). 

Ending these interminable operations of the military industrial complex's war machine may be one of the most significant events of our time (*if* Trump stays true and is successful in this endeavor, and that's a big *if*). The fact that this was *immediately* twisted to evoke the ""big baddy"" Putin is so obviously propaganda from the military industrial complex that it's stunning.

In addition, so many otherwise rational folks are in unison with these TPTB-mandated talking points that I'm starting to wonder just how deeply these individuals have been conditioned by the war machine and the MSM...and if they can ever get out.

One of these talking points is that ""I support withdrawing troops, but not without a plan first!""

Fuck that. That's the military industrial complex's wet dream: more artificial timelines and ""plans"" that can be milked for eternity, especially once a new president is picked that will ""play ball.""

Another pernicious way the population has been conditioned is to resist or be suspicious of *every* decision Trump makes, even if it's a good one.

I see *so* many folks uttering the disclaimer ""I hate Trump, but...""

*This* is the perfect example of just how bad this propaganda has become when we can't even talk about shit we need to accomplish without first distancing ourselves from Trump.

For example, it's *unconscionable* that hemp was still *illegal* to grow in the US in 2018.

If Obama had *very simply* signed an executive order to reverse such a moronic and antiquated policy, he would have been lauded as a hero.

Instead, there are currently *zero* stories about hemp legalization on /r/news and *one* on /r/politics, and the response has been so muted that it's practically deafening.

Granted, the neocons in the Trump administration are certainly still cause for concern, but until Trump tries to start a war with Iran or someone else, their presence doesn't seem to be cause for immediate alarm (again, time will tell on this point and others).

Perhaps even more astonishing, I see throngs of folks lamenting the resigning of ""Mad Dog Mattis"" because...he disagrees with Trump?

Mattis is a career war hawk and represents everything that's wrong with the rampant and insane military industrial complex. His departure should be greeted with resounding cheers and celebration from everyone who loves peace and abhors genocide.

Instead, the once burgeoning antiwar movement that arose during the 2000's has been entirely turned on its face, as so many people have been brainwashed to believe the claims of the career politicians and the military fat cats.

While Obama was the perfect catalyst to extinguish the antiwar movement, Trump seems to be playing a new role of causing cognitive dissonance, but on the opposite end of the spectrum of Obama. Whether Trump is a useful idiot or a bad actor in this regard remains to be seen, but this issue is largely irrelevant with respect to the damage being done.

This hatred for Trump is becoming so emotionally visceral that it's practically impossible to have rational and constructive conversations about these issues.

I can only assume that these disturbing trends are going to get worse before they get better, though that does seem hard to imagine!

Bring the US troops home now, end the military industrial complex's endless war machine, and end the Drug War!

I have browsed this sub for a long time, but admittedly got caught up in the circus (mass psychosis) of the last couple years of political, social, civil, public health, and economic chaos. I have always had an intuitive feeling that Biden was ushered in as President by the powers that be, but went along with it because I felt that Trump was also chosen by the elite. Trump played a very important role, and now it was Biden’s turn (whether Trump was ready to go or not).

I thought, hell, might as well go along with it. Frankly, Biden’s promise of playing nice and ending COVID sounded comforting. What could he possibly do that would be so terrible? He would just remain a boring, white bread, moderately left President and not accomplish nor destroy anything significant.

Well, after yesterday’s press conference, my eyes have been completely opened. **Biden is here to oversee the fall of America as we know it.** He is here to oversee the great reset, the great awakening, whatever you want to call it. Dark times are ahead, and the powers that be have installed a puppet to mislead us, following the installation of a clown to distract us from 2016-2020.

I strongly believe that the next coming years will see great global economic, diplomatic, and societal fallout.

This includes: the worst economic crash of all time, stock market manipulation exposed, the inevitable rug pull of COVID, the public realizing that the last 2 years of their lives have been stolen from them for financial/political gain, Russia and China disturbing global sovereignty, Metaverses, cryptocurrency, and possibly much more. The economic crash will be so severe that it will be used to convince people that a great reset is NEEDED, just like 2 years of quarantines, masks, and vax were needed to stop the pandemic.

I also believe that we will continue to see the rapid cognitive decline of President Biden. I mean, I voted for the man, but yesterday’s press conference was *the single most embarrassing event I’ve ever witnessed* from the White House press floor. He was confused, delusional, misleading, out of touch, and by the end of it, there were numerous times where he was literally incoherent, unable to remember what he was saying as he was saying it.

This may or may not lead to the invocation of the 25th amendment. I’m not sure if TPTB will milk a full 4 years out of Biden or not, given Kamala’s inability to do apparently anything correct. The MSM is already turning on them both, so I’m not sure what this suggests for the impending chaos awaiting us in the next 3 years.

I have never experienced such a 180 degree revelation of my own cognitive dissonance and misinformed biases before. I feel shame, embarrassment, and anger for being conned into voting for these people. I truly believe that Biden & Harris are in place to oversee the darkest times in American history, and to divide this country further than it already is - in a completely different method than Trump’s rhetoric did.

My eyes are now open. I am now looking back at the 2020 election, the exploitation of the pandemic leading up to it, the media circus of narratives (COVID death tolls, Antifa, BLM, Proud Boys, George Floyd, Kyle Rittenhouse, presidential debates, election fraud, Jan 6th) and I see everything in a whole new perspective now. Even popular online conspiracy theory discourse all seem like orchestrated misinformation campaigns to me: Epstein, flight logs, Maxwell, Trump & Epstein, Biden sniffing kids, QAnon, Clintons, Plandemic, Bill Gates.

It's all fucking manipulated chaos and hysteria. We are living in an orchestrated sociopolitical theater, a clown circus, an amalgam of constant psyops and new world agendas. 

Why? I have absolutely no answer nor explanation. But I am seeing things that I have never seen before and I hoped to confide in this sub to share my truths.

**THIS IS A FULL BLOWN ACT OF WARFARE ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT NO ONE EVEN KNOWS ABOUT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON CODE RED.**

# TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM

**MY CONSPIRACY THOERY:**

The SolarWinds most recent hack on the federal government has put the government on an actual CODE RED National Security Emergency -- but they are not telling anyone -- because this is one of those moments where IT ISNT A DRILL is actually happening.

The US Government internally is at a code red -- or one of the highest levels of national security threat. We have been straight up attacked by a foreign entity or an insider. We are not being told the extent as to what is happening regarding this recent hack because the US Government might be seriously fucked. The Federal Government at this point is saying that they have no idea what the intentions of this hack were nor do they even know how many people / agencies were affected besides what we know now.

The lack of coverage in media and from the Government is proving to me that this is in fact one of those moments in history where the WH might be on an actual code red status and we will get word from them once things are more 'secure'.

**SUMMARY:**

The lack of coverage on the SolarWinds Hack that came to light Sunday (when government agencies removed the compromised program, 'Orion') makes me extremely nervous.

The sophisticated hackers were able to upload scripts in an update to the Orion platform as early as March. Clients who downloaded this software update were then unwillingly being monitored in a capacity that we don't even know yet. The US Government still has no idea what the hackers accomplished, how many agencies were compromised (SolarWinds says \~18,000 clients out of 300,000\*)

The IRS has confirmed they were hacked. We might never know what information was stolen / transferred / modified / damaged ever. Senators urging IRS commissioner for briefings as we speak:

**SOURCES:**

""The senators’ letter to Mr. Rettig noted that the breach of the software seemingly not only affected the Treasury Department, which contains the IRS, but also the Commerce Department, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, National Institutes of Health and parts of the Pentagon. The federal government is still working to understand what the hackers accomplished""

Source:  [Senators request urgent briefing with IRS commissioner over SolarWinds hack - Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/17/senators-request-urgent-briefing-irs-commissioner-/)

We might potentially never know:

""Stanford University cybersecurity expert Alex Stamos said there aren't nearly enough qualified threat hunters globally to scour potentially infected organizations for hidden malware from the operation.

“We are going to be reaping an ‘iron harvest’ of second-stage malware for years from this one,"" he tweeted, a reference to unexploded World War II bombs that continue to be found in Europe three-quarters of century later.""

&#x200B;

**FOOD FOR THOUGHT:**

Could this have been an inside job?

Is this related to the dominion voting machines?

Does this have any connection to the fact that Trumps Executive Order on 2018 requiring the release of a full report of potential foreign election interference is DUE TOMORROW -- and that the agency has already said it will not be able to meet this deadline?

Will this spark Martial Law in the US?

Is this related to China's supercomputer?

Could I be wrong and this really isn't a big deal -- thus explaining lack of coverage?

I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing.

I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.

I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. 

Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm). Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511) and knew [Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch) and through [three degrees of separation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/) used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/). If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.






• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?

• The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. 

• The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. 





### The Media
Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.

>With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ) you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath.

Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569).

>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.

This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/transformers/).

This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes...

#[An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House?](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-11/alleged-muslim-spy-ring-why-rex-tillerson-cleaned-house)
>The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet.  Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood “[fifth column” has “infiltrated U.S. Government](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/30/capt-joseph-john-muslim-brotherhood-fifth-column-infiltrated-u-s-government/),” and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration.



 The media is [90% Democrat](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/) and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists?





 










>One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder — why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all?

>Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they can’t sell papers with such a story to tell?














###The Smoking Gun

[EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/exclusive-house-intelligence-it-staffers-fired-in-computer-security-probe/)

>[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html) is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.

>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.

>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.

>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.

Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/). Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. 

[House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/)
>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.


After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers.

>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.



The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/). House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. 

This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. 

Let's state that again...

###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data. 

[Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/feds-arrest-five-congressional-it-contractors-at-the-capitol?utm_term=.jdKQglv0N#.aodQWknOX)

>“At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff,” Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.""





###The Bad Guy


###Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach


The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data.

[House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586)

>Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge.

>More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.


>The former staffer said “Jamal was always there,” but Imran would only work “odd hours.”

And who is investigating this fiasco?

>Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? 


D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the [Congressional members](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586) involved with the Awan Brothers. 

>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.

>""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.

Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. 

The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/) to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. 



>    Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.

>Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/).

Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.

[Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1)
>[frontpagemag](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield) |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.

>The [signatories to the letter](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf) were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.


Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418) and [Huma Abedin](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556) are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?

[http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/)
>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.

>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.




with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. 





















What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. 

While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. 

I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

Everything is to be cited and explained carefully based on specific propositions. If I do this correctly, we should see this thread sitting at no greater than 60%, and at least four comments should be calling me a Russian bot. Let's begin with establishing a simplified version of media's argument/narrative: 

* (1) Skripal was certainly poisoned with a ""novichok"" agent. That is, there is substantial evidence that it was ""novichok"". Even its creator said it was definitely Russia!

* (2) Russia has a monopoly on ""novichok"". Its usage is a smoking gun for Russia's culpability. 

* (3) The UK is following international protocol for dealing with a state actor's usage of chemical weapons.

* (4) Russia is at fault for not bothering to respond to the UK's 24-hour request for explanation. 

* (5) Russia has a clear motive for poisoning Skripal. More precisely, they have *more of a motive* than any other state actor. This is an important qualification that we will explore later. 

------------------

**(1) There is no substantial evidence that Skripal was poisoned with novichok.** 

It is, of course, more difficult to prove a negative than a positive. We cannot prove with complete certainty that the UK government does not have evidence of novichok poisoning, because we do not know what their supposed evidence is. The UK has not presented any evidence, either to Russia or to international channels, that novichok was used. Because of this uncertainty, we must rely on probability and heuristic. Let's begin our inquiry with simplicity: *are* there theoretically possible signs of novichok when it is used as a poison? Would we be able to tell, in hypothetically perfect conditions, that it is used *when* it is used? 

The answer, according to top UK scientists, is a flat ""no"". [According to the textbook literature on Chemical Weapons Toxicology](https://books.google.com/books?id=270uDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=No+independent+confirmation+of+the+structures+or+the+properties+of+such+compounds+has+been+published&source=bl&ots=U3ZWM-v1v_&sig=LQbqQU3B_UuW11ouJZy-FzSj6Vo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwja0ru1_u7ZAhVlU98KHR2-CFEQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=No%20independent%20confirmation%20of%20the%20structures%20or%20the%20properties%20of%20such%20compounds%20has%20been%20published&f=false) from 2016, aptly named ""Chemical Weapons Toxicology"",

>No independent confirmation of the structures or the properties of such compounds (novichok] has been published

The author if this chapter (different authors wrote different chapters) is of utmost importance. You could not find somebody with more relevant credentials than him. No, I mean, you really couldn't. You are going to laugh when you read them. The author who wrote this chapter is [Robin M. Black](http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/chapter/9781782622413-00001/978-1-84973-969-6/unauth). Robin Black [served on the Scientific Advisory Board of OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/SAB/en/sab-20-wp03_e_.pdf).  The OPCW is the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It is a crucial organization for proper international conflicts regarding chemical weapons, which we will get to later. In one of the latest OPCW publications about ""novichoks"", [they state](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/CSP/RC-3/en/rc3wp01_e_.pdf):

>The name “Novichok” is used in a publication
of a former Soviet scientist who reported investigating a new class of nerve agents suitable for use as binary chemical weapons. The SAB states that it has insufficient information to comment on the existence or properties of “Novichoks”. 

Back to Robin M. Black. Guess where else he worked? [At the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in the UK, also called Porton Down.](https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/SAB/en/sab-20-wp03_e_.pdf) Here's [another](https://eic.rsc.org/feature/chemists-on-the-front-line/2000076.article) mention of Robin Black. He has been employed at Porton Down since the 1980's and is tenured enough to [direct other scientists on chemical weapons toxicology](https://books.google.com/books?id=pZhC57gkTBcC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=%22robin+black%22+%22porton+down%22&source=bl&ots=UFau5Hx0Zn&sig=HqDNJT6pgU3X7bUOZ8TwR3vDYp0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrg-uHou_ZAhVQjK0KHaMtC_IQ6AEIaTAM#v=onepage&q=%22robin%20black%22%20%22porton%20down%22&f=false).

To spell it out: the UK's own chemical weapon's toxiology expert wrote that there is no way currently to detect the use of novichok. Although it is impossible to prove a negative in this situation, this is incredibly strong disconfirming evidence. 

As for the last point, that the creator of novichok said it was certainly Russia that was responsible, [he added an important clause](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russians-says-chemist-uncovered-existence-novichok-075342077.html):

>The only other possibility, he said, would be that someone used the formulas in his book to make such a weapon. 

This brings us to point 2:

**(2) Russia does not have a monopoly on novichok**

Although it is apparently impossible to detect novichok, it is not so difficult to make. According to the creator, if somebody ""used the formulas in his book"", he would be able to ""make such a weapon."" Well, how difficult is it to find this book? Was it published only a handful of times and kept in the arcane laboratories of secretive institutions? Of course not. [It's on fucking Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/State-Secrets-Insiders-Chronicle-Chemical/dp/1432725661) And to manufacture ""novichok"" is [simpler than other chemical weapons](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/what-novichok-nerve-agent-center-russian-ex-spy-poisoning-n856001):

>""The Novichok agents are thought to be far more difficult to detect during manufacturing and far easier to manufacture covertly, because they can be made with common chemicals in relatively simple pesticide factories,"" the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says in its Weapons of Mass Casualties and Terrorism Response Handbook. 

Russia does not have a monopoly on novichok. Not even close. 

**(3) The UK is not following international protocol for this conflict over novichok.**

Remember what we said about the OPCW? The OPCW is like the UN for chemical weapons (although the UN is also the UN for chemical weapons, of course). There are only four UN states that are **not** signatories of the OPCW: Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan. Hence, Russia and the UK are signatories. If the UK believes that Russia used chemical weapons in their borders, what does the OPCW convention tell members to do? And if Russia believes the UK's accusation is false, what does the OPCW convention tell Russia to do? According to Article IX on Consultations, Cooperation, and Fact-Finding:

>Without prejudice to the right of any State Party to request a challenge inspection, **States Parties should, whenever possible, first make every effort to clarify and resolve, through exchange of information** and consultations among themselves, any matter which may cause doubt about compliance with this Convention, or which gives rise to concerns about a related matter which may be considered ambiguous. **A State Party which receives a request from another State Party for clarification of any matter which the requesting State Party believes causes such a doubt or concern shall provide the requesting State Party as soon as possible, but in any case not later than 10 days after the request, with information sufficient to answer the doubt or concern raised along with an explanation of how the information provided resolves the matter.**

This is somewhat self-explanatory, but for simplicity's sake: According to international law the UK is to give Russia 10 days to respond. It is also suggested that they make available the ""evidence"" they have against Russia. This last one shouldn't even need to be spelled out in a convention; the right for the accused to see the evidence against them is so fundamental to justice itself that it's almost damning that the UK thinks they can just flaunt this moral obligation. It has literally been in our justice system for 500 years. It's not trivial. It's fucking important. Russia actually spoke to the OPCW, and notably said the following:

>In addition, in this particular case, it would be legitimate for the British side to seek assistance from the OPCW Technical Secretariat in conducting an independent laboratory analysis of the available samples that allegedly show traces of nerve agents in Salisbury. 

**(4) Russia is thus not at fault for failing to reply to the 24-hour ultimatum.** I mean, they actually did reply to the ultimatum by essentially saying ""give us the fucking samples asshole""(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-lavrov/moscow-to-london-let-us-examine-nerve-agent-used-in-spy-poisoning-idUSKCN1GP19U), and can you really fault them with this?

**(5) Russia's motive for poisoning Skripal is not as strong as thought. Other nations have greater motive.**

This is the most complicated proposition. Let's go over the history of Skripal. To begin, [Russia held him in prison on a sentence of 13 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program#Prisoners_held_by_Russia_involved_in_the_exchange). If it were absolutely crucial that he be assassinated, they would have done this when they had custody of him. But a sentence of 13 years is hardly a sentence you'd give for someone you want dead. US gives its spies [10 consecutive life sentences in a super-max prison.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen) So if Russia hated this guy so much, why give him such a light sentence, and why give him away [in a prisoner swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program#Prisoners_held_by_Russia_involved_in_the_exchange)? The other prisoners who were swapped were not assassinated. And Vil Mirzayanov, the chemist who revealed the existence of novichok and who lives a public life teaching at public universities was not assassinated. 

It doesn't take a genius to realize that the motive to assassinate this 60-year-old just isn't there. Moreover, it doesn't take a genius to realize that **this is the worst possible time to publicly assassinate somebody.** Russia's image is in tarnishes. Russia really, really wants its [latest oil pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream#Expansion:_Nord_Stream_2) to be completed unimpeded. [They are hosting the World Cup in 3 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup). They are still in a conflict in Syria. So why would they go about assassinating a nobody? What is the motivation here?

This is the kind of political move you'd make in the game Civilization 5 when it's 2am and you're a little drunk. This isn't the political move that career politicians make when there is so much on the line.

What other nations would have a motive for assassinating this man? Could it be one of the non-signatory nations of the OPCW? Could it be a nation that has a [long history of assassinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_assassinations) on [foreign soil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d9KDysPbZ0)? Could it be a nation that desperately wants Russia to stop defending Iran and Syria, so that it could [continue its decade-long plan to destabilize neighboring countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinon_Plan)?

I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away.


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

Is Assange ""still"" alive (as WikiLeaks, perhaps tellingly, asserts), and if so, where is he? There are several possible permutations. Either:

1. Assange is alive and well in the Ecuadorian Embassy in Hans Crescent, London, and simply keeping his head down (possibly in an attempt to create a news story and give more publicity to WikiLeaks).

2. Assange is alive and has miraculously managed to escape from the Embassy without being picked up the UK police or CIA who were monitoring the building, and has reached or is making his way to, a safe haven (eg Russia). 

3. Assange is still alive, but now in captivity. This could be inside the Embassy, but far more likely, he has been removed and handed to the US authorities who have him in custody on ""US controlled territory"" (and where it is quite likely he is being tortured, like the thousands of nameless other ""enemy combatants"" before him).

4. Assange has been murdered (possibly by poisoning). Either his body is being stored in a freezer at the Embassy building until the  ""appropriate"" time to announce his death, or it may have already been removed. 

5. It is also possible that Assange was removed (or left) the Embassy alive, but has since been killed (ie a combination of 3 and 4).

6. An option I did not initially consider is that Assange could have [realised his arrest was imminent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T_h7pSVIFo) and taken an extreme, but logical step to ensure that he wasn't captured. When faced with the prospect of torture, suicide would be the rational choice. Of course suicide may yet be presented as the official cause of death, and ironically, many people will not believe it.

7. Edit: It has long been argued that Assange (like Snowden) is a government agent, or limited hangout, working for US/UK interests, or even Russia. Alternatively, Assange could be in the process of becoming a limited hangout, perhaps agreeing to redact/restrict the most damaging of the documents in his possession in return for his freedom. 

**What does the evidence point to?**

The best ""evidence"" we have at the moment is several testimonials which purport that Assange is alive and well, inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, or news stories which are designed to make people infer that this is the case. **However, these stories are either inconclusive, suspect or have been proven to be false, in other words they may just be distractions and misdirection.** There have been [other posts covering this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58n6w4/is_assange_alive_has_wikileaks_been_compromised_a/), but these distraction stories include:

 * Final tweet from account known to be controlled by Julian Assange (Embassy Cat) on 15 October.

Why were they removed?
 * [Mark Halperin of Politico attempted to meet with Assange on Friday 21, but was refused by a goon: ""Assange too busy""- video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MJAvCqVIXw)

Bearing in mind the above, and the highly suspicious nature of the so-called ""evidence"" asserting that he is in good health, I think it is reasonable at this point to suspect that Assange has either been killed and/or is no longer inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, so either options 3 or 4, or probably both (option 5) bearing in mind that the US elite will not want to give Assange a trial where he could reveal any more information.

Finally, if Assange has been subjected to extraordinary rendition and/or killed, we must assume that the UK, the US and the Ecuadorian governments are all complicit. It would mean that Ecuador's President Rafael Correa was somehow turned by the US authorities (be it via money or threats, or both [concerning Ecuador's gold reserves being held in the US](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d9641pq/)) into secretly revoking Assange's asylum. It would also mean that the UK authorities have illegally handed over Assange to the Americans without due legal process, knowing that Assange would be tortured and probably killed.

But...let's hope this has all been a bad dream. 

At this point, however, I think the best we can hope for is that Assange is fine and still in the Ecuadorian Embassy, because I think the escape option is by far the least likely of all these scenarios.

TLDR: There has been no proof of life of Julian Assange for at least 9 days. Instead we have seen a raft of distraction stories (even from WikiLeaks itself) which are clearly designed to give **the impression** that Assange is alive and well. Some of these stories have been shown to be old footage or otherwise bogus. So it appears that WikiLeaks is compromised and that probably means Assange is no longer in the safety of the Ecuadorian Embassy. I supect the US authorities probably have the most information about Assange, and his current whereabouts, and we should probably fear the worst.

EDIT: As mentioned briefly above, Julian Assange was due to be interviewed by Swedish prosecutors last week - on 17th October, at a meeting inside the Embassy. [However, this meeting was called off just five days beforehand, on Wednesday 12 October,](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59agk0/the_guardian_reported_on_12_oct_link_that_julian/)  ostensibly because the lawyers ""couldn't make it"". This made me wonder whether it was perhaps Assange who was not available - in other words, could Assange have been out of commission earlier than we realised? Unlikely, perhaps.

Not knowing when the Assange disappearance timeline truly begins is making it harder to discover what has happened to him.That said, the publication of WikiLeaks codes on twitter shortly after the Pamela Anderson ""vegan torture"" visit on 15 October is the most obvious starting point in the chronology.

NOTE (26 October): I am updating this page as new information comes in. If you think there is something I have missed out, please notify me in the comments.

EDIT: 26 October 22.15 GMT. ""Julian Assange"" is apparently participating over telephone link to the CISL Conference.  Opinions?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUYXZMNlBU&feature=youtu.be

EDIT: The ""Assange phone-in"" has finished, but can stil be accessed in the above link. Assange is introduced starting around 3h.15 - you don't see him, only hear him. Please listen to Assange's comments (via phone link) and decide for yourself.

EDIT: Transcript of ""Assange's"" answers during the conference call by /u/qrestlove [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59jyze/julian_assangesupposedly_on_a_spanish_tv_show/) 

EDIT: In my view, that sounded like Julian Assange talking. However, I am by no means certain, and I note plenty of you think it definetely was NOT Assange, so I am keeping an open mind. The Caller referenced his internet being cut off at the Embassy, and the telephone call (to a public CISL event) **appeared** to be live. At this point we can't be certain, so this event doesn't qualify as a proof of life. The whole episode was decidedly odd, seeing as there was zero advance publicity from him or the event organisers about him being a contributor to the conference.

It certainly leaves many questions unanswered about his physical and legal status, his current location and ultimately whether Julian Assange is himself entirely legit, or perhaps some sort of limited hangout. 

EDIT: Or perhaps he has been legit up until now, but, as /u/founthead posits, is [in the process of becoming a limited hangout, to secure his freedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d99pj0t/)?

EDIT: John Pilger has published an article, based on a lecture he gave yesterday (27 October) at the Sheffield Festival of Words in which he states: 

**""That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.""**

The article is here: http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/28/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-trump/

John Pilger's website is [here](http://johnpilger.com/). Pilger is a journalistic legend and a friend of Julian Assange, and although it goes without saying, this is not a formal proof of life, Pilger's ""truth"" credentials are pretty much unrivalled. It should be stressed that Pilger and Wikileaks have stressed Assange is ""alive"" but not his whereabouts.

EDIT: This post is being unstickied as it has become unwieldy. Sadly, we are no nearer establishing exactly where Julian Assange is, but (what I believe to be credible) information has materialised which suggests he is ""still alive"". However, there is no sign that Assange is ""still in the Ecuadorian Embassy"", and he apparently hasn't been there since about the 17 October. ",conspiracy,Russia

Then Zelensky getting on the Grammy awards for a propaganda speech to the American public? Unbelievable! Daresay, unprofessional! I can't think of any time in recent history where a foreign head of state was given a public platform at an award event. I wonder who greenlit THAT.

The net result is that i don't care anymore. We have a war going on that is bankrolled by the very countries that are sending money, weapons and sanctions to oppose Russia.  And until all the ""Allies"" get on board with disrupting Russia's sale of oil and natural gas....well, it's gonna be another slog like Iraq was. Yay for the oil companies and weapon manufacturers though. Honestly, I don't know if Europe COULD sustain sanction on Russian energy. The west is fucked on this issue, and Putin knows it.

And Covid. Must anything else be said? This dangerous virus that required an economic self suicide, masks, political divisions, and an untested vaccine....now barely registers a blip on media.

Of course, the admin bleats about how Putin is the cause of all the high prices, inflations et al. That is so demonstrably untrue that I can't believe they parrot that.  The idiotic COVID policies turned that spigot on.

It was the fact that she called her close relatives in Russia to ask them about the whole Russia taking over Ukraine news she just saw.

Wikileaks, in case any of us forgot, was the foundation of some of the best resources for conspiracy theories in the last 20 years. 

For a short time in the 2000s/2010s, Assange's work was supported even by the corporate oligopoly known as the entertainment (strickly for liability reasons surely) industry. Until certain files were leaked. Not going to lie, that era is a bit memory-holed. But Rolling Stone used to release decent investigative articles when Matt Taibi was the editor and ran articles on Wikileaks annually. Major magazines like Time and Newsweek likewise covered plenty of WikiLeaks content. 

Things changed around the Bradley Manning release. Bradley is now Chelsea Manning but was Bradly at the time of the leak. Someone associated with Wikileaks got arrested. Assange was holed up in Ecuador for years (while being spied on). From my recollection, Wikileaks publish content sent to them and did not illegally obtain the data. 

Assange was no longer in the news. John McAfee became a pirate and was accused of murder. The US got insanely polarized in 2015-2016. And the Podesta leaks were the last straw with Wikileaks and Assange (Pompeo and the CIA discussed assassinating Assange), News slowly morphed in to clickbait titles and blatant yellow journlaism. Everything from sports to sneakers to brands were politicized. Even if you were apolitical, you would be forced at some point to express a political view. Like buying a coke or wearing Nike was suddenly related to the two party system. 

Nobody filled the gap Wikileaks left. No other major journalist or whistleblower group popped up to take their place. The Snowden leak went over a lot of people's head considering the Patriot Act and CISA courts. It was nearly impossible to find a place to discuss these things, as they required lengthy exchanges and lots of sources. The media rarely covered what Snowden leaked. They absolutely covered his escape to Russia and various other Snowden things. But rarely the content of the leak. 

And that leak happened when most Americans had social media and devices impacted by the ""technology"" Snowden exposed. Basically, everyone with a smartphone or who goes on the internet was impacted by the fact the US gov had advanced spyware.

But no, it was all just Trump in the news. Couldn't discuss anything remotely political without someone making it about Trump. 

The grounds for Assange contesting extradition included arguing the US prison system violates the UN/Geneva Convention human rights standards. And complete crickets in the US despite the fact Assange's extradition case would support a position like no bail and BLM. Why wouldn't the US media want to expose how terrible US prison conditions war after the summer 2020? 

The simplicity of it is Assange published things that upset powerful people and they used their power to destroy and torture him. And that's wrong. He didn't publish lies or dangerous misinformation. He shared mostly government documents where the government actors incriminated themselves. So they are making an example of Assange to show everyone what happens to journalists if they anger the American government, While the US is lecturing everyone about human rights, Assange is rotting in prison because what he published embarrassed/threatened powerful people. That should never be a partisan issue. If a government is committing crimes, the truth needs to be told. Assange wouldn't have had to publish those documents if governments were honest with their citizens. Their lies caused the need to publish the truth. 

Lies are at the root of all evil. And like parasites, they die when they no longer have someone to attach themselves to. Had we rejected lies sooner, Wikileaks would not have needed to exist. If the governments of this world were honest with the people they are supposed to serve, there would be no incriminating leaks because they wouldn't exist. 

So we are all responsible for allowing the Leviathan of Lies to slowly chip away at every aspect of our societies. But once that is acknowledged and we no longer participate in lies, they will cease to exist.",conspiracy,Russia

Most folks are aware that people are in bubbles, some even recognize that they themselves are in a bubble. How many are aware though of who owns the bubbles? 

There is a very simple divide in humanity, those who have & those who have not. The haves are less than 1% of the population, while they've convinced the have nots to fight with each other while blaming themselves for the situation, not the oligarchs who are orchestrating everything. 

In America they divide the population into teams blue & red while the rest are checked out for numerous reasons. The oligarchs have legalized their corruption. They pay Republicans to be the Harlem Globetrotters while they pay Democrats to be the Washington Generals. Even a cursory glance at modern history will show the Democrats repeatedly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. A closer look shows that everything is always framed from a Republican perspective. Whenever the two parties come together, it's to serve the oligarchs at the expense of the rest of us.

https://fair.org/home/russia-has-oligarchs-the-us-has-businessmen/

153,ISIS is a tool of Western Governments to overthrow Assad. How are there so many people still acting like the US/Israel didn't cause ISIS to happen?,996.0,3vwryz,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3vwryz/isis_is_a_tool_of_western_governments_to/,230.0,1449566534.0,"It's a bit frustrating how much public denial there is, especially when it's become obvious [Turkey is buying ISIS oil, and Israel is ending up with most of it.](http://www.globes.co.il/en/article.aspx?did=1001084873) This is funding ISIS, to the tune of $1.5M per day. 

ISIS is a tool of the west, [that's why NATO just decided against having troops on the ground to fight ISIS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3vss9j/nato_has_ruled_out_sending_ground_troops_to_fight/)  Because ISIS is our Ally, not our enemy! They want to overthrow Assad in Syria and install an Israel/US friendly puppet government, instead of the Russia/Iran puppet government that is currently in place.

It's the same reason Russia made more progress in bombing ISIS in 2 days than the US did in 2 years. Because the US wasn't really bombing them. [They were telling them to evacuate the buildings before they bombed them](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=188_1411748599), and they were also bombing empty fields.

Why does ISIS drive 95% Toyota Tacoma/Hilux trucks? [Because the Department of State gave them to them. ](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/the-u-s-government-supplied-isis-iconic-pickup-trucks.html)

All this is because ISIS is the US government's secret allies, because Israel wants to overthrow Syria, but the western governments don't want anyone to know who is doing it because it is illegal under international law. More importantly it undermines international confidence in our trustworthiness and other nations may refuse to trade with us and ally with us if they know we are openly using such dirty tactics involving so many foreign mercenaries to the point where we created an entire army with a name, ISIS. So instead we act like it's all 100% ISIS's fault, and that the US/Israel had nothing to do with it other than making some Muslims mad from previous bombings. This is the narrative of all the media channels. 

But now that the west has gotten caught by the international media in funding and arming ISIS, they pretend it's all Turkey and Saudi Arabia. They're the next level of fall guys after the pure ISIS blame. Israel and the US are running out of layers of credible deniability if Americans would just wise up a bit. But people are largely eating up the story that it's 100% Turkey and Saudi Arabia's faults. But who grows the military of these countries? NATO and the US. Who controls both those? The Israeli Government (or Zionists, to be more accurate, which is a religious ideology about retaking Mount Zion in Jerusalem that is intertwined with the goals of the Israeli Government including expanding Israel to overtake Palestine). That's why Israeli lobbyists make up the biggest lobbying groups in the US. That's why Israel is our #1 military aid recipient. 

The US is the #1 arms exporter in the world. The CIA is known for overthrowing countries and installing new governments. People know these individual facts, but they need to step back and put the pieces together. 

Syria is being overthrown because they want control of the land, the oil, the pipeline routes, the central bank, the war reconstruction profits, and the government. They want it all. And why not sell a few thousand missiles and bombs and drones and tanks in the meantime? For them, this is win win. Profits and power gains. They care not for the human death toll, except for how it hurts their PR image. So that's just a matter of media messaging, to convince the public it's for humanitarian reasons (""Assad is gassing his own people and we need to stop him!""). Or revenge reasons. (""Paris attack was done by ISIS, let's bomb Syria, fuck those guys!"") The public is convinced, and they keep getting away with it. Emotional manipulation. 

Boiled down, it's simple. **The western governments are supporting ISIS, not fighting them. And who is the head of the western governments: The US and Israel.**  


----

Why do 90% of Americans have so much trouble thinking in this direction? I guess people just _really_ don't want to believe that their media and government could tell such a dirty deep lie so consistently, that they've all been fooled, and that the media and government just simply 100% can't be trusted to deliver truthful information anymore, even on the big stuff. That's a big pill to swallow. Too big for 90% of Americans? Mark Twain said it's easier to fool a man than it is to convince him he's been fooled. This is because of pride and ego, which Americans have no shortage of. We're far too busy justifying mistakes to be able learn from them.

How far away does the media have to get from reality before people start connecting the dots?

They say every new truth goes through 3 stages of public acceptance as the idea spreads: 

1. It is ignored, laughed at, ridiculed.

2. Then, it is opposed and debated furiously.

3. Last, it is accepted as obvious fact. 


I think when it comes to this subject matter, the American public is still largely in stage 1, quite unfortunately. People are in stage 2 about Turkey and Saudi's relationship to ISIS, but the US and Israel are left unquestioned by the MSM. I think Russia is in stage 3 about this, Putin called out the US's behavior to the UN in a recent speech, and many other speeches before. In Russia this is open and well-known, but in the US it is a dirty secret that is being covered up by propaganda as much as possible. 


I just really don't get how people are still fooled by this, much less 90% of Americans. It's time as a culture we wake up and embrace what may be a scary truth, so that we can make positive progress. The fact we are being lied to is out in the open. We can't accomplish anything while everyone is in denial of what the problem is, as Americans largely are. 

We can't depend on any media to do this for us, we must talk to each other. It's clear the media has no interest in conveying truth anymore, it is simply a propaganda machine for the governments of Israel and the US, and for the corporations (many of whom make up the military-industrial complex), so now it is up to us to communicate the truth to each other. The burden is on us to grow beyond our emotional attachments to our worldviews, and to see the world from many different angles so that we can see the truth, and to help each other see that truth.",conspiracy,Russia

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

“Then, late last month, documents emerged in London concerning Russia's largest tax fraud, an alleged $US230 million heist that led to the untimely deaths of four people and threatens to damage the Russian government.”

''Would you like to add stature and credibility to your company by appointing someone with both an English title and substantial qualifications to your board? Lord Stubbington is available,'' reads a letter circulated by Taylor's wife, Priscila Lustre Taylor.

“The global arms-smuggling network feeds on this frailty, just as it feeds on the cast-off planes and pilots of the former Soviet Union. Adding to the intrigue over the seized flight 4L-AWA in Bangkok was that the Ilyushin-76 transport plane once belonged to a number of notorious international weapons dealers, including Viktor Bout - the so-called ''merchant of death'' and inspiration for the 2005 Hollywood movie Lord of War. The plane's current owner was an entity with headquarters in the United Arab Emirates but operated by Air West Ltd, based in Georgia. Air West had leased the aircraft to a New Zealand firm called SP Trading through a series of bank accounts in Estonia and New York.”

Yes, the timing is obviously politically motivated, yet that doesnt make the contents any less significant or any less damning to me.
The narrative that I was lead to believe was incredibly far from the whole truth.. Only sharing for anyone else like me who was believing a wildly inaccurate narrative.. Some of this was just for context, but a lot of it are things I've only recently learned.

Sorry if its a bit scattered, there was a lot of things I didn't know. Maybe everyone else already knows all the details, if so, I apologize for wasting your time.

It turns out, they're all crooks.

Burisma is a Ukrainian natural gas company that was founded and ran by a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, who was basically the poster-child for corruption.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky

The SFO investigator Richard Gould claimed in the April 2014 court hearing that Zlochevsky’s dual position in Ukraine as both a politician and a businessman gave “rise to a clear - wilful and dishonest exploitation of a direct conflict of interest by a man holding an important public office - to an abuse of the public’s trust in him”.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/the-money-machine-how-a-high-profile-corruption-investigation-fell-apart

“May 13, 2014: Burisma Group announced that Hunter Biden [and Devon Archer] would be joining its board. Around that time, Burisma’s founder, a former government official named Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for alleged money laundering by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-timeline-idUSKBN1W82HK

Zlochevsky is still suspected of bribery and other crimes by several different countries. (His whereabouts are currently unknown.)

https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senate-probe-finds-john-kerry-falsely-claimed-he-had-no-knowledge-of-hunter-bidens-role-in-burisma/


Viktor Shokin was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in 2015-2016. He was leading an investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shokin

According to him, ""On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of [Burisma], but I refused to close this investigation.”

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/documents-heighten-scrutiny-on-biden-ukraine-dealings-indicate-hunter-may-have-made-millions


So Burisma.. The same company that sent Hunter Biden $83k every month to do nothing?

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf

“Hunter Biden sat on the Burisma board from April 2014 (while the company was already under investigation) until April 2019.”

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/13/20912336/hunter-biden-resigns-chinese-firm-impeachment-inquiry-joe-trump


So we know Hunter Biden was on the Board of Directors at Burisma while they were being investigated by Viktor Shokin.. Well here’s where it got interesting to me..

Testimony from sworn affidavit of former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin:

“6. ...[President] Poroshenko asked me to resign due to pressure from the US Presidential administration, in particular from Joe Biden, who was the US Vice-President. Biden was threatening to withhold USD$ 1 billion in subsidies to Ukraine until I was removed from office…""

“7. The official reason put forward for my dismissal was that I had allegedly failed to secure the public's trust. Poroshenko and other state officials, including representatives of the US presidential administration, had never previously had any complaints about my work, however. There were no grievances against me or any allegations that had I committed any corruption-related (or, indeed any other) criminal offenses. Biden never stated anything of the kind either…”

“8. The Truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings (""Burisma""), a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors. I assume Burisma...had the support of the US Vice-President Joe Biden because his son was on the Board of Directors.”

“9. On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company, but I refused to close this investigation. Therefore, I was forced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration. In my conversations with Poroshenko at the time, he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma. When I did not, he said that the US (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice, therefore, but to ask me to resign.”

- December 8, 2019, former Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by a reporter whether he knew of Hunter Biden’s activities during his tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry told the reporter regarding Biden’s position on the Burisma board. “What would I know about any—no. Why would I know about any company or any individual? No.”

However, Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee that he informed Kerry personally of Biden’s role at Burisma. Wade received an email on May 13, 2014, from Kerry’s stepson, Chris Heinz, telling him that Hunter Biden and associate Devon Archer had joined Burisma.

John Kerry and Devon Archer are the ones who made me realize this isn't just about Joe and Hunter Biden..

When I looked at John Kerry is when I started to get pissed.. This wasn't just your run of the mill ""pops looking out for his boy"" type of corruption.. This is definitely something bigger than just Hunter and his father..

""According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Bohai is China's oldest private equity firm, having launched the country's first yuan-denominated fund in 2006....Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm founded by Michael Lin and James Bulger, son of former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger.[3] Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm, founded by Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Hunter Biden""

“The firm InfoUSA, headed by major Clinton backer Vinod Gupta, has placed Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi Jr., on its payroll – even though he has no experience in the company's main business activities, NewsMax has learned.”

“Just four weeks after Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House this past January, Gupta and InfoUSA hired her son as a senior vice president. He told NewsMax InfoUsa pays him $180,000 a year.

Even though his job with InfoUSA is considered full-time, Paul Pelosi continues another full-time job, as a home loan officer at Countrywide Home Loans, part of Countrywide Financial, in San Mateo, a suburb of San Francisco.”

At the expense of bloodshed, they can manipulate the psychology and opinions of everyone on the globe. The media is force feeding pro-Ukraine pro-NWO propaganda down people’s throats. They’re so blinded by initial, irrational emotional reactions from seeing shellings and death, that they can’t foresee the actual implications of this unification under a globalist scale.

All wars are about money and power. Transactions are being made every second and people are getting rich as we speak, donations to Ukraine will be used to proliferate war crimes, and to line the pockets of the elite. Countries that aren’t a part of NATO will be incentivized to join through fear from the staged war. Once they do they will be taxed into oblivion, and once again that money will be used to fuel this agenda and to line the pockets of the elite. Sanctions will be used as a guise to hike prices, again so the rich can profit.

Once the good guys save us all from the bad guys, they will require more trust from us. They will require more control. A one world government will be instated, as well as a one world bank. Your actions will be monitored through social credit systems, to make sure you aren’t a bad guy, so that they can keep protecting you. This is all a theatre, and before our eyes we see people blindly choosing sides, and believing everything that they see or hear.

People are very sensitive to shock value, and it makes them herd into the desired direction that the propaganda tells them to head towards. In this case, this staged war and propaganda is leading us to the full-on acceptance of the NWO, and brainwashed individuals will stand by it tooth and nail that it is a welcomed control.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

EDIT: (please read to avoid misunderstandings)

1.) When I say staged I don’t mean faked, there is a distinction to be made here. Obviously there are people dying, and the fighting is real. What I meant is that the conditions for the war were set up intentionally by all parties involved. It is mostly out of the civilians control. 

2.) I am not right-wing nor am I attempting to spread Qanon, this is not related. I am not a Russian apologist or shill. I condemn the war in every manner. I simply believe it was set up by elites and has a much deeper agenda, rather than it simply being because Putin wants oil or land buffers.

3.) I am not attempting to move goalposts or make specific timeline predictions. The great reset began in 2020, and I suggest looking up the great reset agenda on the world economic forums website, as it confirms some of my stances. I believe the great reset is not a singular event but a transition into a NWO state through *several* events. 

4.) This is a conspiracy theory, I don’t claim any of this as fact. I am not an advisor, nor do I claim to have any solutions, this is merely a theory/observation. This post is for speculation and to think of what is happening in different ways. I’m glad it sparked a few conversations. Thank you",conspiracy,Russia

From Russia to Hunter Biden, Kirk and Binney have the answers that you want. Kirk is particularly interested in talking and discussing the truth.

The plan is to keep this thread open and treat is a rolling AMA. So if your question wasn't answered today, it will be sometime!

These next days are a unique time to discuss the truth. That truth is that there is every intention to use the runaway capacities of the universal surveillance state, in the context of, and with respect to this most unusual American election in over 100 years, to set a precedent that would end American constitutional rule in the short term.

William Binney and J. Kirk Wiebe are specialists in this matter. They risked and lost their careers at the National Security Agency (NSA) directly after 9/11 in an attempt to fight the corruption at that agency. They want you to Ask Me Anything about what single individual citizens can do in the next hours and days to expose the state-and-above-state actors that must be called out NOW, so that the truth can set people free.

Putin is a tyrant and a dictator, but he is also a globalist puppet playing out a script that was written long ago. Absolutely hate this dude but understand my hatred is what *they* want. Fuck Putin.

2. The [Ukrainian president](https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/special-address-by-volodymyr-zelenskyy-president-of-ukraine?fbclid=IwAR3ydsgyWlzw7tkx5KRGN3rbSEXnvkNE6XOXC9s7Zc3_TMhwlbsHFXyQA-Q) is an absolute joke, a literal sketch comedy actor with [extremely shady history](https://www.dcreport.org/2019/10/03/now-you-know-how-really-weird-this-whole-ukraine-thing-is/). All the praise he's getting all over Reddit should clue you in on what's going on. Propaganda is working quite efficiently. He is leading innocent Ukrainians to their death while he will come out unscathed. Also a globalist puppet playing his part. Fuck Zelensky. 

3. Yes geopolitics are incredibly complicated and I'm not saying things are as simple as the first two points, but in a theater performance, all of the production that happens behind the scenes is equally complicated and coordinated. 

4. I love my country. I grew up in western Ukraine. Ukrainians are incredibly nationalistic, patriotic and brave, and hate Russia with a passion because of historical atrocities. I can't help but feel that this hatred is being channeled for Ukrainian men and women to give their life defending Ukrainian glory in an absolutely needless conflict. 

5. Klitschko brothers in Ukraine, Tulsi in US, all these other various minor characters are also puppets with clear links to WEF. It pains me to say this because Klitschko brothers were my idols growing up, and I really supported Tulsi during the last election. Fucking WEF snakes - they're literally everywhere. Perhaps it's an over-reaction on my part, but at this point, anyone who shook hands with Schwab and was part of his programmes is guilty until proven innocent.

6. During COVID pandemic, republicans were more measured with lockdowns and mandates. Democrats turned into demons. Now, Republicans are ""supporting"" Putin and Democrats are seemingly doing the right thing by supporting Ukraine. These flip flops (I personally view them as such, you may disagree) on important issues are meant to subvert the political orientation of many Americans and confuse them. The two party system in the US and in many other countries is by design meant to confuse and blind, but I digress.

7. It pains me to see what is slowly becoming a real tragedy. I have relatives back in Ukraine who are in very uncertain place, mentally, emotionally, and in terms of pure physical survival. With that said, I find it incredibly difficult to get invested in these events because I know this is all, at the end of the day, a sick globalist game being played out to usher in their NWO dystopia. It does pain me to see people suffer. I want to and will help as much as I can, but I refuse to be mentally invested in this conflict just as I refused to be living in a constant state of fear with the scamdemic we just got through. 

8. Come what may, don't lose your humanity. Help those you can in your circle of influence and don't get too invested in this sick theatrical game that Klaus Schwab and his den of soulless parasites are carrying out.

EDIT: some are claiming this post is propaganda. If I was in your shoes I would be skeptical too. There is a lot of fuckery going on all over social media. You can go through my submission history, I've talked about being Ukrainian in the past, albeit not much since I do not like giving out any personal details on reddit. My username *konval* is taken from *konvalia* which is Ukrainian for *lily of the valley*, a flower I used to love picking in early spring with my grandmother. While I *am* Ukrainian, I do not currently live in Ukraine. I have lived in the US for more than half of my life. I love both countries, consider both *my* country despite rampant and increasing corruption in each. 

I want Ukraine to retain its sovereignty and I want Putin's botox clown face to fucking melt already. I'm not mincing my words - fuck soviet union and fuck Putin for trying to recreate it. With that said, I have suspicions to believe that the Ukrainian president wants Ukraine to fall. My intuition tells me, despite his theatrics, he couldn't care less about Ukraine or its poor people. There is no clean way to resolve this situation, and I believe it will only get worse, which is why I'm taking my emotions out of this political and wartime theater and focusing on how I can help poor people stuck in this terrible situation.

One last thing, [this statement](https://www.activistpost.com/2022/02/order-out-of-chaos-how-the-ukraine-conflict-is-designed-to-benefit-globalists.html) is spot on:

*""The Ukraine scenario could be easily defused if both sides took some basic diplomatic measures, but this is not going to happen. NATO officials could take a step back from their pursuit of adding Ukraine to the ranks. The US could stop pouring cash and weaponry into Ukraine to the tune of $5.4 billion since 2014. Over 90 tons of military equipment have been sent to the country in 2022 alone. Russia could stop sending covert special operations units into the Donbass and be more willing to come to the table to discuss diplomatic solutions. The reason these things do not happen is because they are not allowed to happen by the power brokers behind the curtain.""*",conspiracy,Russia

The fully vaccinated account for 9 of every 10 deaths from COVID-19 in England and 4 of 5 deaths among the triple-vaccinated, according to the latest data published by the U.K. Health Security Agency.

[The independent British news site The Exposé reported](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/03/01/russia-distraction-uk-gov-revealed-triple-vaccinated-account-9-in-10-covid-deaths/) the [government report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057599/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week-8.pdf), published Feb. 22, includes a table on page 41 confirming the vast majority of deaths were among the vaccinated.

About [73.5% of the population of England has been fully vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=GBR), and 56.9% have received a booster shot, as of Feb. 28.

Top health officials around the world, [including in the U.S.](https://www.audacy.com/kmox/news/national/cdc-director-says-vaccines-are-not-preventing-transmission), have acknowledged that the COVID-19 vaccines have not stopped infection or transmission amid the omicron wave – the premise for vaccine mandates – but have insisted the shots prevent hospitalization and death.

However, between Jan 24 and Feb. 20, there were 9,230 COVID-19 hospitalizations in England. The fully vaccinated accounted for 6,689 of them, the triple vaccinated 4,936 and the unvaccinated 2,341.

During that period, there were 4,861 COVID-19 deaths, with the triple vaccinated population accounting for 3,120 of them. The unvaccinated population accounted for only 559.

Overall, the vaccinated population accounted for 89% of all COVID-19 deaths during the four-week period.

The Expose said it's most concerning that while the rate of hospitalizations and deaths has declined for the unvaccinated, it's increased for the vaccinated and boosted.

Between Nov. 22 and Dec. 19, the vaccinated population accounted for 77% of COVID-19 deaths. The latest figures represent a 48% increase. Meanwhile, COVID-19 deaths among the unvaccinated have decreased by 37%.

In the United States, [newly published CDC data shows a massive increase in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations](https://www.wnd.com/2022/02/cdc-data-covid-infections-hospitalizations-spike-among-vaccinated/) since the emergence of the omicron variant among those who have been fully vaccinated.

Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist and epidemiologist who is one of the leading critics of the COVID vaccines, pointed out that ""reductions in hospitalization and death were never demonstrated"" in randomized controlled studies.

""Now, (there is) disappointment as the data come in to support what everyone has known for months,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Thankfully, the consequences of reality simply cannot be ignored.

Some gems

""President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week's intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing. ""

""The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats.""

""According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted ""disinformation.""""

So this means BuzzFeed, CNN, NYT, and multiple other outlets published unsourced claims that were supposed to be examples of ""disinformation"" in intelligence meetings. Quite a big blow to media credibility.

Edit: And some more from James Clapper

""We also discussed the private security company document, which was widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it. I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.""

I didn't check DNCleaks 

Everyone was worried about searching for PIZZAGATE and overlooked this. Pizza gate is just a small piece of the BIGGER picture!!! If you use twitter, add on to your hashtags #pizzagate #AlienGate 

Germany was the first country that was interested in Antarctica. Hitler's theory was the earth was hollow and the poles at the end of the earth were the entrance into the center. He said the bloodline elites lived in there (fallen angels or theory is they are reptilian) Hitler was so interested in what was there that he CONTINUED his expedition while WW2 was going on.

There is something there!!!! Julian was trying to tell us by alll the pictures in the leaks. My anon friend said Julian worked out a deal with the CIA and world govts to leak out certain emails to control the minds of the population. If this is true, then Julian would have to communicate with us thru hidden code. So, when searching in WL we need to look for code language. 

First off let me say... Cloning is real, all governments do it. The elites have been pre conditioning us about cloning for a LONG time. 
There's been many cloning movies that give us clues. The freemasonry symbol is identical to the movie Avatar. Which is about cloning humans and aliens

the Simpsons have episode on cloning
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HLITQXRH70M

Here's an example of a Britney Spears clone. Looks nothing like her. She posted this on her twitter. 
 [clone ](https://sli.mg/5eZSU5) 

Here is info from a guy named Don Marshall, he said he's been to the cloning centers and tells all. He can easily be a puppet of the illuminati but he's giving us this info for A REASON. To condition the public...
[don Marshall ](http://donaldmarshallrevolution.com)

George Green was an insider and he tells us about how the elites are cloning and have contact with aliens. 
He said they used to hologram, but now they can clone a walking talking real life person since 2008. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PIKUslVwbs
I think the above two people are puppets but are part of the ""pre conditioning"" the public for what is to come. 

Also, Phillip Schneider worked for the govt building underground bunkers. He said there were 300 + in the US and mentioned Antarctica too. He said the govt budget for this type SHIT is half a trillion. Each bunker cost $17 billion and takes about 2 years to build. The govt averages 3 a year. He also says there is underground railroads the connect all the bunkers which blows the technology we have out of the water. Their technology and roadways make us look ancient. I think this is why trump says our roadways are 3rd world bc he prob knows what type of high tech stuff they have underground. There was a video he posted of the underground bunkers (I think) but it looks like it's been deleted. Phillip also told us there were grey aliens living underground too and he saw them with his own eyes. He said we make deals with them for exchange of tech/energy, so this could be where some of our kids are going. Phillip says 100,000 kids go missing per year, not counted for. Not kidnap but just disappeared.  After he gave this speech he was murdered!!!!

Also, you need to remember the Pope met with Patriarch Kirill of Moscow earlier this year, something that hasn't happened in 1000 years, and he told Krill the end is near. At the same time Putin moved The Ark of Gabriel (Has very bad energy) from the middle east  to Antartica. What stuns me about this is, Im reading a book right now called the Islamic Anti-christ. In the  Quran their Messiah is our Anti-christ in our bible. Is the Arc of Gabriel a way to welcome the demons and antichrist on our land?

Ok, Now the mystery of Julian disappearance:
So, if it's true that Julian worked for the CIA and wanted help he would have to send messages to us thru code the hidden code in the wiki misspelled tweets spells out HELP HIM. Why did he send that in code? Bc  someone was watching over him even before he was captured on Oct 17?
. [HELP HIM ](https://sli.mg/DBvByu) 

The US govt been trying to get their hands on Julian for a long time. For what? To maybe clone him? If so they would have to plan this out in great lengths. For years the US has been destroying the Ecuador economy [here ](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Meet-the-Banker-Brothers-Who-Destroyed-Ecuadors-Economy-20160613-0025.html) 
The elites KNOW they get their way if they bribe you. So, they destroy Ecuador economy then bribe Ecuador to give up Julian for cash to rebuild their country. 
The Don Marshall website posted above explains the different types of clones the govt is involved with. He also explains the clones take 5 months to fully grow. I find it really fkin weird that Julian's next appearance is Feb 19. That's 4 months and 3 days after he went missing on Oct. 17 
Could it be possible the US bribed Ecuador in exchange for Julian to clone him?? He is worth more ALIVE bc the public doesn't trust mainstream media. There trust is in WIKILEAKS but majority of the people don't  trust WL without Julian being in charge. WL will fail if Julian is killed. Then the elites won't  have a platform to use to control our minds... MSM fail, WL fail if he's dead. They can't just release him bc he will rebel and run. The elites NEED Julian more then ever especially after Trump won and is threatening to drain the swamp.  They need WL to help spread their propaganda. 

PROOF CIA IS RUNNING WL :One of the WIKILEAKS associates told us NSA and CIA are at war. NSA being the good guys. So, WL the other day RELEASES NSA Germany leaks. Like fkin kidding me? They are fkin stupid. WL is obviously ran by CIA right now bc they are taking jabs at NSA using merkels leaks who is caught throwing up NWO gang signs [here ](https://sli.mg/lHE8wf) 
A lot of people say this 4chan post is fake but I feel like it has some truth to it. That's how CIA works. They feed us truth with dis info. [NSA VS CIA ](https://sli.mg/uwE69h) 

So, having said all that... Its a lot to take in especially with all that has been revealed in the last 3 months. Antartica has to be where the Aliens are located and experiments, such as breeding and cloning etc. go on. In the last 2 years Millionaires are FLOCKING to New Zealand (near Antartica) and underground bunkers are in high demand right now. The elites are preparing for doomsday.

 We recently found out about pizzagate, which is extremely evil and sickening! Its a huge global pedo ring that involves all the world leaders, politicians, bankers, judges, FBI, CIA, and Hollywood and now... Aliens. WTF  This could explain the reason behind kids vanishing. Last week Turkey went nuts blowing up #pizzagate asking where their 9,000 children went. 9,000 refugees were suppose to go to Germany... but they DISAPPEARED! Yeah, put those dots together!! You can't give them cash bc wth they gonna do with it? lol Shit is barley worth anything up here in the real world. 
So, I think we all need to come together and research every end and demand answers:
1. Pedo Sex Ring/ Satanic Ritual Murders--> Research location of disappearance of kids  (Example: Watch Phillip Schneider video (above) and write down where all the underground bunkers are. Theres a HUGE one under Denver airport. Maybe theres connections around that airport like the Haiti borders place across from Besta Pizza?  Tunnels under comet that lead to the ETs? #Pizzagate 
2. The ET and Antartica, Who's all connected and I think the Pope calls the shots lol Who's visited Antartica, how often? Secret meetings? Global warming is BS i think so meeting on global warming could actually be about the ETs?  #AlienGate 
3. Julian can either be dead or they are cloning him but we need to stay on their ass about POL #WhereisJulian
4. Go to church, Pray, stay stocked up with food, water and ammo... AND STAY AWAKE and PREPARED.. We are definitely living in the end times #Godspeed

Joe Biden announced to send another $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine while many Americans struggle with record-high gas and groceries prices, baby formula and food shortages, 401Ks crashing due to market collapse, highest inflation, and highest interest rates since 1994.

Joe Biden announced on Wednesday after a phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he will send additional aid for security and humanitarian assistance. “I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas,” Biden said in a statement. “Today, I am also announcing an additional $225 million in humanitarian assistance to help people inside Ukraine, including by supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items,” Biden added.

Secretary Antony Blinken announced on his Twitter account that he would spend the $350 million for additional U.S. arms, equipment & supplies for Ukraine as part of the $1 billion assistance. ""As authorized by @POTUS, I am directing the drawdown of $350 million in additional U.S. arms, equipment & supplies for Ukraine—part of $1 billion in U.S. support announced today to reinforce Ukraine’s defenses against Russia’s senseless war of choice. ""    — Secretary Antony Blinken, June 15, 2022

“Speaking in Brussels, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. and Ukraine were working in lockstep to meet Ukraine’s requests for new capabilities, especially its need for long-range fires, armor and coastal defense,” CNN reported. “This package also includes $650 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds and that will help Ukraine defends itself with two additional Harpoon coastal defense systems and thousands of secure radios, night vision devices, thermal sites, and other optics,” Austin announced. U.S. President on Wednesday announced a fresh U.S. infusion of $1 billion in weapons for #Ukraine that includes anti-ship rocket systems, artillery rockets, howitzers, and ammunition.

The U.S. also plans to send another $225 million in humanitarian aid, Biden said.  “The Biden administration has previously provided Ukraine with over $5.3 billion in military assistance, of which $4.6 billion has come since February 24, according to Kahl. The $1 billion announced Wednesday is on top of these numbers,” R.T. reported.  Biden’s announcement comes after his rant about reckless spending on Tuesday. Joe Biden began screaming out of nowhere and scolded critics for claiming his reckless spending caused inflation rates to spike. “I don’t wanna hear any more of these lies about reckless spending!” Biden shouted.

Joe Biden spoke at the AFL-CIO labor union convention in Philadelphia where he defended his abysmal economic track record and lashed out at Wall Street. Biden repeated the same boring lies in his speech to 2,000 union members and state officials: “We’ve made extraordinary progress and put America in a position to tackle the worldwide problem that is worse everywhere but here, inflation!” Biden said.",conspiracy,Russia

The disconnect in people is that they view every opposing opinion/view as propaganda but refuse to consider the information they’re taking in in support of their opinion/view as propaganda as well.

The earliest replacement would come with the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General by the Senate.

What effect will this have on US Intelligence collection?  Will this have the side effect of preventing further investigation of Trump's ties with Russia?

Will the Trump admin simply ignore the FISA process and assert it has a right to collect information on anyone they please?

Edit:  With a replacement AAG on-board, it looks like FISA authority is non-issue here.  But it appears we are in a constitutional crisis nonetheless.

Beginning:

>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.

>The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.

>The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. 

Additionally it's reported that the reason this occured was because Trump was boasting about his access to secretive information.

>In his meeting with Lavrov, Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” the president said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange.

>Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.

It was also noted that none of this was the US's to reveal and would likely damage our relationship with the country who shared the information.

In a statement, Sen. Feinstein said that ""[the] innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice. The only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.""


CNBC included the following as highlights of the more than 300-page transcript:


>- Steele, Simpson testified, told him the FBI also had a source inside the Trump operation, although he wasn't sure whether that meant the presidential campaign or the Trump Organization. The bureau was more inclined to believe Steele's information, he said, ""because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization."" NBC News' Ken Dilanian later tweeted that the supposed walk-in source ""was a mischaracterization by Simpson of the Australian diplomat tip about Papadopoulis.""


>- Simpson touched on how the Trump Organization handles paying taxes: ""One of the things we found out was that, you know, when it comes to paying taxes, Donald Trump claims to not have much stuff. At least the Trump organization. So they would make filings with various state and local authorities saying that their buildings weren't worth much.""


>- Simpson discussed Trump's relationship with Sater: ""This was something he didn't want to talk about and testified under oath he wouldn't know Felix if he ran into him in the street. That was not true. He knew him well and, in fact, continued to associate with him long after he learned of Felix's organized crime ties. So, you know, that tells you something about somebody.""


>- Fusion GPS Joshua Levy claimed that someone died as a result of the dossier: ""Somebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.""


>- Fusion GPS did not secure full access to Trump's tax returns, Simpson said: ""They were Trump properties and I believe we may have reviewed some public information about estate taxes and things like that. We didn't have access to his tax returns.""


>- Simpson said he only become aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer when it was reported in the New York Times: ""I was stunned.""


>- Simpson had no ""factual reason to believe"" the Trump Tower meeting was a Russian attempt to make contact with the Trump campaign, but: ""You know, as a sort of question of counterintelligence and just general investigation of Russian methods and that sort of thing, I think that's a reasonable interpretation.""


>- Fusion GPS concluded that Trump ""exaggerated"" his properties' worth in legal filings — but that did not indicate or show connections to Russia: ""Not that I recall.""


>- Simpson said Trump's country clubs aren't making any money: ""They were not profitable entities. I don't specifically recall. I just remember that these were not doing very well and that he'd sunk a lot of money into them and he hadn't gotten a lot of money back yet.""

Russia has said it is standing by to continue the peace talks which was scheduled for today. Could the resistance and increased killings of civilians prompt Putin to reconsider and reach a settlement, short of what he has previously demanded of NATO?

In his testimony, Comey expounded on his numerous interactions with President Trump that he initially described in the [opening statement](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf) that he released to the media yesterday afternoon. 


Comey spoke candidly in response to the Senate Intelligence Committee's series of questions, stating (among other things) his beliefs that President Trump pressured him to end the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and that Trump eventually fired him for his handling of the overall investigation into the administration's relationship with Russia. He also elaborated on what he considers to be a long-term effort by the Russian government to meddle in the United States' 2016 presidential election which included cyber attacks on perhaps as many as one thousand government agencies and related institutions. 


What are the most significant takeaways from this testimony? How will it affect the media and the public's perceptions of the Russia controversy, if at all? Similarly, how will this testimony affect the likelihood of an impeachment of the president, if at all? 


Do Comey's remarks prove that Trump obstructed justice in any way, as some of his critics allege?

First, [CNN is reporting](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-wiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html) that Paul Manafort was wiretapped both during the 2016 campaign and beyond:

> US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.

> The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.

Second, the [New York Times is reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html?_r=0) that Manafort was told by prosecutors to expect to be indicted:

> The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, then followed the house search with a warning: His prosecutors told Mr. Manafort they planned to indict him, said two people close to the investigation.

On the one hand, this may spell trouble for President Trump as it may implicate the highest ranking members of his campaign in nefarious activity.

On the other hand, this may at least partially validate Trump's claims of wiretapping. There is a chance that Trump's communications with Manafort could have been collected on.

Recently, Flynn has been charged with the following by Special Counsel Mueller:

>Flynn is accused of falsely claiming that he had not asked Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, last Dec. 29 ""to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day.""

>Flynn also allegedly lied by telling the FBI ""he did not recall the Russian Ambassador subsequently telling him that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request,"" the information says.

>Flynn is accused of falsely stating that he ""did not ask the Russian Ambassador to delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution,"" according to the filing.

>The charge against Flynn carries a maximum possible prison sentence of five years.

Personally, I feel that the second charge, stating that he did not recall something that in fact did happen, sets an important precedence, as the default ""get away"" answer used by Sessions, Flynn, or usually any lawyer, is ""I don't remember"" or ""I don't recall"". This case makes it so that that is not viable to tell the FBI or judge you don't remember something critical. 

And in regards to the prison sentence, while it may not seem like a lot at first, the charge isn't for colluding with Russia, its for lying to the FBI. And 5 years is longer than a single presidential term, so unless Trump somehow gets a second term as president (unlikely in my opinion but not impossible), putting Flynn in prison for 5 years is the equivalent of permanently taking a chess piece out of the game.",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

1. Every prominent Chinese international relations scholar except one predicted Russia would not invade.
2. Chinese officials rebuffed Biden administration representatives multiple times when presented with intelligence over the past 3 months, explicitly stating they ""did not think an invasion was in the works."" 
3. The Chinese embassy in Kyiv didn't issue evacuation notices to the 6000+ Chinese students studying in Ukraine and is now struggling to safely charter flights for them. This is highly out of character for a country that prides itself on looking out for its overseas citizens and makes propaganda films like ""Wolf Warrior"" to emphasize it.
4. While not explicitly supporting either Ukraine or Russia, China has expressed its displeasure of the invasion by having its state-owned banks restrict financing Russian commodities, abstaining from the UN Security Council vote, not helping Russia evade sanctions thus far, implicitly criticizing nations who ""unscrupulously damage other countries' sovereignty,"" and openly calling for negotiations and peace.

The Stimson Center's explanation for China's massive oversight in spite of their own satellite intelligence was their military philosophy based on Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War,"" which stresses ""winning without fighting"" and views all-out warfare as the least desirable tactic to be used only as a last resort. The Chinese expressed support for Putin's anti-NATO position before the Olympics fully expecting him to surround Ukraine with troops and negotiate from a position of strength, as they might do. Instead, Putin cashed their support in as a blank check for a full-scale invasion that united the West in fury and placed China in the crosshairs as a potential accomplice.

Not only have there been hundreds of cease-fire violations in Ukraine’s eastern territories controlled by Russia-backed separatists as of late, there have been numerous reports that Russia is massing an unusual number of troops on its border with Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, these recent events have alarmed NATO and sparked much speculation as to Russia's next moves and ultimate aims.

Biden in his first telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy affirmed “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression,” according to a statement from the White House. Meanwhile, the 30 members of NATO have sent envoys to discuss the situation and express concern. On the other hand, the Kremlin warned that any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine would escalate tensions further and prompt Russia to take additional measures to protect itself.

Scholars and policy experts have speculated that Russia might be testing the waters and probing how the new Biden administration will react. However, some have not ruled out another full invasion and land grab by Russia. This is particularly because Crimea has been suffering from a debilitating water crisis ever since Ukraine shut down the [North Crimea Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Crimean_Canal). This action in the aftermath of the annexation has devastated the agricultural industry of the region and created huge financial strain on Russia. Last month, the Ukrainian government reaffirmed that they won't turn the water back on until Crimea is returned to them. It's therefore likely that Putin is planning, or at least considering, to further invade Ukraine to capture the source of the canal, and turn the water back on by force.

The overall US/NATO resolve has remained largely consistent at base levels and aligned with the Ukranian people.

Presently, based on the Russian conduct, it does not look like Putin wants to part with much of the Eastern and Southern territory that it occupies, perhaps even less likely is Crimea which it has unlawfully occupied and annexed in 2014.

2. The invasion is primarily a result of Putin's desire to recreate a ""Greater Russia"" and is essentially driven by imperialistic ambitions rather than a reaction to anything Ukraine, NATO, or the west more broadly has done.

Macron, in a TV interview Wednesday night, gave a long and sometimes-ambiguous discussion of how France might react if Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear force were to come true.

His answer, to the France 2 network, suggested that such an event may fall short of France's own threshold for striking back.

The position was at odds with a much firmer statement by G7 countries Monday, in which France and other nations warned of ""severe consequences"" to the Russian use of nuclear weapons.

Macron was asked: ""Would France consider a tactical strike by Russia as a nuclear strike?""

 He replied: ""France has a nuclear doctrine. It lies in the nation's fundamental interests that are clearly defined. They wouldn't be questioned should there be a ballistic nuclear attack.""

France's [current nuclear policy](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04079/) is to use nuclear weapons only in self-defense, a definition Macron suggested would not be met by an attack on an allied nation like Ukraine.

Macron also tweeted on Wednesday: ""We do not want a World War.""

It came after the joint G7 statement, in which member states — including the nuclear-armed US, France, and UK, said: ""We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences.""

71,Russia takes step towards mass mobilization amid new criminal codes amid reference to Martial Law. If transition to war occurs; Must US and NATO respond with direct involvement or should it ask Ukraine to compromise. Is there another alternative?,445.0,xjlckm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/xjlckm/russia_takes_step_towards_mass_mobilization_amid/,459.0,1663709723.0,"With recent Ukranian counter attacks and plausible success of Ukraine in capturing some of the lost territories and attacks inside Russian territories with either drones, longer range missiles and or saboteurs; Putin has been under increasing pressure to declare war and transition from special operation to mass mobilization. 

Putin had been hesitant in the past, but now he could change his strategy. He will be giving a nationally televised speech on Ukraine Wednesday \[rescheduled from Tuesday\]; he may well approve of some limited martial law and escalate; if escalation occurs, it may well be reminiscent of attacks on Grozny in Chechnya and Aleppo in Syria. 

The Russian State Duma, \[its lower house of parliament\], passed on Tuesday a proposal which would allow concepts of 'mobilization' and 'martial law' into the criminal code.

Russia's parliament further approved harsher punishments for certain crimes, including desertion, harming military property and insubordination during military operations. A copy of the proposal suggests that voluntary surrender will be a punishable crime by ten years in prison, according to Reuters.

This movement coincides Ukraine's success, Russian occupied regions in the Donbas region announced on Tuesday that they would hold referendums to join Russia. According to RBC, the Russian backed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic will have a referendum on uniting with Russia between September 23 and September 27 - from this weekend. This may well include the partially occupied Kherson region. 

Ukraine for its part has maintained that only force can resolve its conflict and take back its territories. It has further asserted that the referendum only demonstrates Russian weakness. U.S. has rejected the upcoming referendum as a sham. 

Must US and NATO respond with direct involvement or should it ask Ukraine to compromise. Is there another alternative?

If the United States were to begin working with Turkey, however, to clear out ISIS from Syria (a plan articulated by the Turks yesterday), would this not change the situation significantly inside Syria?  Turkey has been working with Assad's Syrian government and Russia for months now, and so this operation would essentially align American foreign-policy objectives with those of Russia and Assad's Syria, and could even allow the United States an avenue for involvement without forming an outright alliance with Russia.

A few days earlier tensions soared in northern Kosovo after unknown attackers exchanged gunfire with police and threw a stun grenade at European Union officers overnight.

Animosity mounted after Kosovo scheduled local elections in four ethnic Serb-majority municipalities in the north for December 18, with the main Serb political party saying it would stage a boycott.

Explosions and shootings were heard earlier this week as election authorities tried to prepare the ground for the vote, while an ethnic Albanian policeman was wounded after law enforcement was deployed in the region.

Hundreds of ethnic Serbs, outraged over the arrest of a former police officer, gathered early last Sunday at roadblocks they erected the previous day, paralyzing traffic at two border crossings from Kosovo towards Serbia.

Serbian officials claim that the NATO and European Union-led peacekeeping missions are unable to protect the minority Serbs in Kosovo from harassment by majority Kosovo Albanians and that their security forces can do the job.

Aside from requesting authorization from NATO to send its own troop to Kosovo \[which it expects to be denied\], Serbia also raised combat readiness of its troops on the border with Kosovo and warned it would not stand by if Serbs in Kosovo, who make up less than 10% of Kosovo’s population, are attacked.

What are her chances like? It's been a while since the 2008 election and she's not as visible as she once was, but I would argue she's still not super popular among the general public. However, she is an avowed Trump supporter which helps her fit in with the current Republican Party and I'm sure helps her among her base. Alaska is solidly Republican which does't hurt. I know that she was very well-liked among a lot of Republican/conservative members of the general population in 2008-09 and into the early 2010s, but it's been several years and I don't know what her popularity is like now.

Interviews in 2008 (like the ones with newscaster Katie Couric) showed that, at least at the time, she had little knowledge of things such as foreign affairs; moreover, she was generally seen as not good with the news media. One Couric interview, in particular, was famously widely maligned, including by comedienne Tina Fey who parodied Palin on the television show ""Saturday Night Live"" with the line ""I can see Russia from my house.""

Though things like foreign affairs aren't quite as important as a rank-and-file Congressperson as they are in the role of the Vice President, I don't know if that type of thing will help or hurt her.

Add into that this (also relevant to world stage):

> Trump’s most astonishing policy statement is his declaration that America would only defend the Baltic states from Russian attack if he concluded that they “have fulfilled their obligations to us.” Given that Trump has spent his entire campaign insisting that America’s allies are not fulfilling their obligations to us, that’s pretty close to saying Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are on their own.
> 
> It’s hard to exaggerate the magnitude of Trump’s remarks. NATO, the military alliance that underpins the post-World War II order, rests on the principle that if one member is attacked, the others will come to its aid. Saying that the United States may or may not abide by that principle is the military equivalent of saying that the United States may or may not default on its national debt (which Trump has also said). Were Trump elected, these comments alone would reshape the geopolitics of Eastern Europe, as regional leaders began cozying up to Russia out of fear that the United States wouldn’t defend them.

RAND's analysis suggests territorial debate is too narrowly focused on one dimension of the war’s trajectory. Territorial control, although immensely important to Ukraine, is not the most important dimension of the war’s future for the United States.

RAND concludes that, in addition to averting possible escalation to a Russia-NATO war or Russian nuclear use, avoiding a long war is also a higher priority for the United States than facilitating significantly more Ukrainian territorial control.

Furthermore, RAND acknowledges that the U.S. ability to micromanage where the line is ultimately drawn is highly constrained since the U.S. military is not directly involved in the fighting. Enabling Ukraine’s territorial control is also far from the only instrument available to the United States to affect the trajectory of the war. RAND highlighted several other tools—potentially more potent ones—that Washington can use to steer the war toward a trajectory that better promotes U.S. interests. Whereas the United States cannot determine the territorial outcome of the war directly, it will have direct control over these policies.

The alternative, RAND asserts, is a long war that poses major challenges for the United States, Ukraine, and the rest of the world.

Fewer people now can afford the luxury of filling up the tank. Prices on food and all other products are also soaring due to the rising inflation and increasing transportation costs.

Meanwhile, Russia has found ways of overriding the sanctions with the help of China and India.

Washington and Brussels urge Beijing and New Delhi to refrain from importing Russian energy but to no avail.

-Trump declared “My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,” Trump said Wednesday, saying the latest attack “had a big impact on me.”

Trump is relying on the judgment of Mattis, according to the source."" Graham and Mccain suggest the U.S. should ""lead an international coalition to ground Assad’s air force.”

**Edit 2:** Asked directly whether Assad should leave power, the president said, “I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity. He’s there and I guess he’s running things, so something should happen.”

**Edit 3:** Defense Secretary James Mattis will brief President Donald Trump on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago on military options against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's regime. Mattis is expected to present Trump with a range of options, including:

- Grounding all Syrian aircraft

- Strikes against their air defenses

- Standoff strikes

- Targeted strikes against those responsible for the chemical attack in Idlib.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the conditions of Assad's ouster would be determined through the international political process.

""The process by which Assad would leave is something that I think requires an international community effort, both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war, and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving,"" Tillerson told reporters on Thursday.",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

Its leader, Alexey Navalny, is in prison. His followers are outlawed; they are forced to hide outside the country. It is similar to former elections in neighboring Belarus. The regime is going to hold elections without international observers in order to legitimize Putin for upcoming years. 

Navalny can be treated differently, though. He is a nationalist and homophobe that is usual for Russian politicians, but still, he is a sincere anti-corruption fighter and a personal enemy of Putin. Navalny was a target of an assassination attempt a year ago, probably made by special forces, but he returned to Russia even though he knew he could be arrested and even killed.

His supporters are not the candidates for parliament as they are arrested for a range of pretexts, forced to flee, and are not allowed to take part in elections for reasons that look absurd. Some of the Navalny’s followers are officially called ""foreign agents"".

Before he got poisoned, Navalny created a unique service – “Smart Vote” which gives recommendations to voters for the purpose of concentrating votes for a specific candidate. During the municipal elections of 2019-2020, this resulted in a number of opposition candidates to the city parliaments. 

But now, for opposition voters, the choice is complicated.

The recommendations of the “Smart vote” fall on “anyone except the ruling party”. In the meantime, “anyone” mostly means Putin's pocket communists-descendants of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) where Putin used to be a member, or LDPR nationalists of Zhirinovsky. This choice reduces the number of parliamentary mandates of the ruling party - United Russia, distributing them between two other main parties. Meanwhile, the service pays the least bit of attention to the Democratic party Yabloko due to some disagreements.

It is still unclear how to transform a good idea into a qualitative result for democratic freedoms.

  *  US can't have land warfare against Iran. Iran has population of 70 million and the country is mountainous as hell. More than twice the size of Iraq!

  *  Whole country would unite to fight the common enemy.

  *  After initial attacks Iranians can escalate the war, but US has no means to end it.

  *  Iran is technologically and culturally more advanced that Iraq. Aerial warfare was ineffective against Serbian military in Kosovo war and same would happen in Iran.



  *  Iran can constantly harass oil and gas shipments in the Gulf with asymmetrical warfare.

  *  Iran can sabotage oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain etc.

  *  Iran could create a major oil spill and set it on fire: it would block the Straight for weeks, even months. Also, mining the straight would be a good option. 


  *  US attack against Iran will turn Iraqi government against US. (Iran has Shiite majority and they are already starting to purge Sunnis from the government). Attacks against remaining US troops, contractors and embassies will either force US to get drawn to Iraq war again (this time fighting against majority of Iraqis with Iranian help) or leave the country and lose it to Iranian influence.

 Klitschko wrote on Telegram that hundreds of such centers are in operation, as well as hundreds of emergency generators, adding that “I do not want, especially in the current situation, to enter into political battles. It’s ridiculous.”

Klitschko, who had been mired in several disputes with Zelenskyy before the invasion, said the president’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts, including “incomprehensible photos” posted online.

 “To put it mildly, this is not nice. Not for Ukrainians or for our foreign partners,” Klitschko said.

The Russian invasion in February has transformed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from a leader with sagging popularity into one of the world's most famous political figures. Yet before the war, Klitschko was better known globally, at least to boxing fans.  

Even when the Russians were nearby, Klitschko never stopped working out of City Hall, a massive stone building in the center of Kyiv, surrounded by sandbags. He said in a recent interview with *The Sunday Times* that he's left the city just twice since the war began. 

 Is Klitschko, a potential challenge to Zelensky?

>This could all change in the event of a large-scale conflict in Europe. Public support for joining the NATO alliance is at a record high in Sweden and Finland as a result of the ongoing tensions. If the worst should occur in Ukraine, it would only drive Sweden and Finland away from non-alignment and towards NATO membership. If one of the reasons to not join NATO is to avoid disrupting the precarious balance of power in the region and Russia disrupts that balance by invading Ukraine, it would make NATO membership a viable option for Finland and Sweden. In this case, it is highly likely that Finland and Sweden would join together, as they did in 1995 with the EU.

It was sent as follows.



""Thank you for contacting me regarding H.R. 624 – the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). It is always a pleasure to hear from those that I represent in Congress.

Every day U.S. businesses are targeted by thousands of  state employed hackers working for the  government s of China ,  Iran, North Korea, and Russia. These hacks result in the loss of valuable intellectual pro perty and sensitive information—$500 billion  worth in  just  the last year. This is the largest theft in the history of the world.
 
The Chinese and Russians are literally robbing us blind,  and there is currently nothing that the U.S. government can do to stop it. 

Our Nation has spies in China and these other countries, so our intelligence community has knowledge of secret techniques that the Chinese , Russians, and Iranians employ to rob American owned businesses. Because this information is classified, the U.S. government cannot adequately warn private businesses how to better protect themselves.

The government currently has no methodology for sharing  such information with the private sector. You would think that we already do, but the government is desperately trying to play catch-up with advances in technology.

CISPA would allow the U.S. government to share classified information with private American businesses, so these businesses can adjust their website filters to new and classified threat signatures.
 
I voted in favor of CISPA. I  did this only after I received multiple classified briefing on all aspects of the bill.

As a former trial judge, I am very leery of giving our government any more authority than it already has.

I believe that some counterterrorism powers granted to the federal government since 9/11 have gone too far.

We have been expanding federal police powers so much in the last few years that we are losing a balance between security and liberty.
 
I am satisfied that CISPA will not expand government intrusion into the lives of Americans. I strongly oppose any bill that would allow the government to spy on U.S. citizens.

CISPA specifically prohibits the government from searching your library records, what books you buy, your firearm sales record, what ammunition you buy, your tax returns, your education records, and your medical records. The federal government cannot and shall not snoop into your private lives.

Furthermore, CISPA does not allow the government to use any information that could be used to identify an individual.

What CISPA does do is protect our businesses from continually being robbed by the Chinese. It allows private businesses to have someone on their payroll receive a security clearance, at no cost to the federal government, so that person can learn from the government the latest techniques the Chinese are using to rob their business.

These businesses will work with the federal government on a strictly voluntary basis. Nothing in CISPA can force the private sector to participate in information sharing.

CISPA would also allow the private sector to share with the government ways that the Chinese and other hackers att ack their systems and network. Our g overnment networks are attacked every day and are increasingly becoming more vulnerable. The Chinese, Iranians, and North Koreans would love nothing more than to be able to affect our Nation's po wer grid, nuclear power plants, water resources,  and defense systems.

I have always said that the private sector is more innovative than the federal government. I believe that advances in the private sector can help keep our Nation safe from foreign interference.
 
Cyber threats evolve at the speed of technology. It may surprise you to know that the Chinese government is already spying on American citizens by reading our emails, seeing our search histories, and monitoring what we purchase. 
 
It is the duty of the United States government to protect its citizens and its territory from threats both foreign and domestic. This includes protecting U.S. digital territory. But, and I cannot stress this enough, CISPA focuses on keeping foreign hackers from spying on and attacking  our businesses, infrastructure, and our citizens . CISPA does not give the government the authority to monitor your networks or emails. CISPA does not give the government the authority to shut down websites. And CISPA  does not allow the government to amass data on U.S. citizens. 
 
The business community overwhelmingly supports CISPA. Because companies are being robbed blind, CISPA is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, GOOGLE, AT&T, Verizon, IBM,  Microsoft, Intel ,  Oracle , and many  many more.  And because Americans are being spied on by the Chinese and Russians,  Facebook also supports CISPA. You may be surprised to know that the Chinese use  Facebook to spy on U.S. citizens. 

Finally, CISPA grants individual citizens, who feel that the government violated their privacy by sharing information with companies, the right to sue the government. This is a right that is currently not enjoyed under U.S. law.

I believe it is paramount that U.S. citizens have recourse  against the government if they feel they have been wronged. 

I hope this better explains my vote.""

We are a group of Ukrainian scientists asking for your help in stopping the aggression against our country and helping Ukraine reach a peaceful solution to the problems it faces. Regardless of which language we use in our families or professional lives (e.g., some speak Ukrainian and some speak Russian), we are citizens of Ukraine and we are convinced that no part or region of our nation needs “help” brought by the bayonets of outsiders. Moreover, the presence of the foreign troops on our soil will have both short- and long-term destabilizing effects on our society. The aggression must be stopped before it escalates into an uncontrollable situation.


A few words to our colleagues and friends from Russia: Your freedom tomorrow starts with our freedom today. Help us by protesting your government’s actions and by refusing to participate in a disinformation campaign against Ukraine. To freedom, ours and yours!

There is no more Warsaw Pact. The EU centralizes Europe to an extent(albeit more economically than militarily) and there's the United Nations Security council which accounts for the worlds superpowers and the veto gives France, the U.K. and the US the power to block motions from China and Russia and vice versa. I've heard people argue that Putin wants to destabilize EU and NATO but how is NATO at all as important as the EU in the modern age? And if it exists to protect Europe from Russia then couldn't the argument be made that there should also be protection put in place against the US given our track record in the Middle East and South America? So why do NATO deserve to exist in the 21st century?

Edit: Let me clarify something. I'm not saying the US would go to war in Europe. I'm saying that the US(the most powerful member of NATO) has relationships with countries, like Cuba, Chile, Iran etc., that are comparable to Russia's relationship with Poland, Romania, Ukraine etc.. I would even go as far to say that the US has a more imperialistic track record than Russia/USSR. There was a time when NATO(united military of capitalist countries) was at odds with the Warsaw Pact(united military of socialist states), but the Warsaw Pact is gone. And I see that Russia is a threat to former eastern bloc states and I know that it is powerful and but other countries in the modern day could say the same thing about the US(from a Syrian perspective, what is the difference between Russian interference and US interference). So why is Russia(a powerful country but still only one state) such a pariah that it requires the existence of a union of western military powers to oppose it? At the same time why does the US not need the same check on its military power. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

First off, I can understand why some countries would like to have nuclear weapons. I think NK or Libya are good examples. It gives them leverage in the global discourse. So, my question isn’t *why does anyone want nuclear weapons?*

Rather, Russia and the U.S. have ~7,000 weapons each. While France, China, the U.K, Pakistan, and India don’t have nearly as many, the all have over 100 each. Why? Is this just the result of human nature equivalent to the proverbial dick-measuring contest? 

Now, I’m no expert on geo-politics, military readiness, or anything of that nature. But as I said above, I can see why in the most basic sense a country would want nuclear weapons. But, at the end of the day what good does having 7,000 of them do? 

I would speculate, if a country—any country—drops a nuke, the whole world would rally together to punish the offender. If a country drops multiple, I think the world would obliterate them in one sense or another.  So if a country never intends on using their nuclear warheads, or only would use them as an absolute last resort for defense, why would they have so many?

My basic questions are:
1.  Why do nuclear states need so many nuclear warheads?
2.  What are the arguments for keeping such a high number?
3. Is there any proposal or thought on what a “reasonable” number per country would be?",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

Thus, having Ukraine in NATO might lead to war with Russia, or undermine the world's belief in article 5 if Russia attacks Ukraine and we *don't* respond. Both of these are hideous outcomes which is why almost all international relations experts don't want Ukraine in NATO.

Trump's comments might seem like simple ignorance, but not paired with his other statements:

- As part of his monologue about other countries ripping us off, Trump includes our NATO allies: **"" We are defending Germany, we are defending Japan, we are defending South Korea, we're defending so many countries, we get peanuts.""** Trump wants to ""renegotiate"" our troop deployments: **""South Korea should pay for them.""**

There’s more than one side to consider here and reddit (in general) has been failing to foster a genuine discussion on this story that argues against the popular opinion. Here are a couple points I wanted to make: 

(Also check out [this panel] (http://csis.org/event/schieffer-series-discussion-data-surveillance-prism-and-nsa) on this very topic hosted by Bob Schieffer. I'll reference it implicitly and below, since it gels pretty well with my opinions.)

**1** **Stop calling this man a hero.** Seriously, I don't care if you believe in the cause he did this for or not we shouldn't be putting this guy on a pedestal. If you are participating in civil disobedience, part of that action, according to Henry David Thoreau, is to be willing to pay the price for those crimes. Look at Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, and Ghandi. These people are heroes. They stood up to injustice peacefully and paid the price, sometimes with their lives. *That's* heroic. Turning tail to China and Russia with a backpack full of secrets to sell is a coward's tactic. It’s the difference between being a whistle blower and committing treason.

Also don't take everything Snowden says at face value. In my opinion, he was overselling the info we had and what he really knows to make his product more appealing to the Chinese. The claims he was making seemed very far-fetched for someone in his position, and if he was planning to sell his information it stands to reason that he would try to make it sound more attractive for potential buyers. I can’t point to a lot of hard facts to back this up, but call it a hunch.


**2** To think that the NSA even has the capability to read every person's emails and listen to every person's phone calls is ludicrous. Do they collect everyone's meta-data? Yes. Is it illegal? No. Should we be discussing the merits of it is legal or not? **ABSOLUTELY.**

BUT...that conversation needs to be driven by FACTS, not fear mongering and speculation.

To think that the NSA has enough analysts to actually look at the content of everyone's communications data is a fantasy. Even if they had the capacity, the legal safeguards of preventing them from targeting innocent Americans means people can't just be targeted without reasonable suspicion without at judicial warrant.

I do get that the court that approves this activity is secret by nature, and I think it's fair to expect more transparency not just from this, but in general about this program. I feel that this should have been made public when it was implemented so we could discuss this in the public forum rather than it being leaked. PRISM is an instance where I feel the government used classification to shield their political reputation rather than national security.


**3** Like it or not, signals intelligence (SIGINT) is a necessity for tracking terrorists around the world. SIGINT is the foundation of intelligence against terrorists and other disciplines can't stand without it.  The capabilities that the NSA data collection gives us are instrumental in this sense. I do think we, as a country, need to have a discussion about just how threatening terrorism really is and how much of our fear is just a hangover from 9/11. In my opinion, terrorism is still a concern that necessitates a vibrant intelligence community that can handle such elusive threats. In that sense, I am more concerned about the potential for lives to be lost rather than my meta-data being stored.


**4** Regarding Germany's complaints toward the United States about spying on the EU and Snowden saying that they are ""in bed with each other"": he's right in a sense. Obviously friendly countries share intelligence. This is nothing new. But I would also have to assume Germany's outrage over the US spying on them is an act, or just extremely naïve. In the nation state system we live in, states don't have fixed allies, only interests. Every country spies on every other country, no matter what their allegiances are. Espionage isn't an act of war. It's how the game is played in this system. Even if you don't want to do that, it's irresponsible as a nation since your obligation is the safety and well-being of your people. If everyone else is doing it and you aren't, you're at a huge disadvantage. If the Germans are so upset, they should get better counter intelligence. This is obviously a very geopolitical/realpolitik take, and that philosophy has its flaws. But it's an accurate descriptor of the international system that we live in, which, in my opinion, works better than what humanity has tried in the past.



Anyway this is my opinion and feel free to respectfully engage me if you agree or disagree. And even though I disagree with how the part of the argument that is most prominent on reddit is taking over the conversation, it's still a conversation worth having. Keep speaking your mind and contact your congressional representatives and let them know how their constituents feel. An informed and honest electorate is what drives a successful democracy.

**TL;DR: Don't be lazy. Read things if you want to discuss them.**

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit 2:** Wow I didn't think this was going to get any attention. Thanks for the generally good and civil responses. I don't have time to respond to everyone here but I'm glad I fostered some debate. I did want to add a few things in general:

Sorry I didn't source all my arguments and but I'm doing this from my iPad with average Wi-fi so I couldn't put a ton of research time into it. I'll plan a little better next time. Also this is mostly my informed opinion and doesn't have any more or less merit than reddit's other opinions. I just wanted to try to give a voice to the minority that the main subs/most upvoted posts didn't reflect.

187,"Assuming that Russia hacked the DNC and/or others with the intent of influencing the election, what should Trump do about it? What is expected of him, and what is within his power?",112.0,5mc8qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5mc8qm/assuming_that_russia_hacked_the_dnc_andor_others/,356.0,1483686714.0,"I tend to trust our intelligence agencies when they all agree that Russia was responsible for hacking and attempting to influence the election (call me crazy, I know).  Assuming that this is true, what should Trump do about it?  In particular, what would liberals / Democrats want him to do about it? 

Is it just a matter of getting Trump to acknowledge that the hacking occurred?  Is that the goal here?  If Trump came out and said ""Yes, Russia hacked us, and that's very bad, and we should try to prevent it next time"" would that be a sufficient response? Or is Trump expected to punish Russia in some way, possibly sanctions?  

As an aside, are the reports true regarding John Podesta's email password being something like ""password""?  If so, doesn't he deserve some of the blame for making it extremely easy for another country to compromise our election?  To me, it's kind of analogous to someone who leaves the keys in the ignition and the car running every time they park.  Eventually, their car will get stolen.  Yes, the car thief should be fully punished, but the owner of the car was also acting irresponsibly and should change their behavior.  This is especially true when the stolen ""car"" is not just personal property but instead is a democratic election that affects an entire country. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

The Magnitsky Act was passed in response to the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison, and provides a mechanism for sanctioning individuals for human rights abuses. Russia's reaction to passage was a ban on US adoption of Russian children, as well as travel bans on a list of US officials, along with ongoing lobbying efforts.

The initial sanctions list included individuals directly connected to Magnitsky's death, with more individuals added over the years. According to the [Treasury website](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/), there are currently 44 individuals sanctioned under Magnitsky. I will include the list in the comments section. There are also a variety of downloadable SDN lists (specially designated nationals and blocked persons) available via the Treasury site.

Owing to China’s history of conflict with the British Empire, China’s leaders are familiar with the way the British operated in the nineteenth century, and they seem to appreciate how the empire’s power did not rely solely on soldiers or warships; it came, rather, from the empire’s control of ports, canals, railroads, mines, shipping routes, telegraph cables, commercial standards, and financial exchanges"".

Putin invaded the Ukraine to annex Crimea after the 2014 coup that ousted the Russian friendly government there.

For example, during the cold war, many self described socialists were highly educated and the only place socialism was able to live was on college campuses or in highly educated/prosperous cities like New York, DC, San Francisco, and Portland. I believe it was the same in Europe, where cities like London, Berlin, and Amsterdam harbored socialists.

If you have been following the campaigns you like most thought this was a 3 headed race, and barely that. It was narrated as a Clinton v. Sanders Battle Royale, with an O'Malley in the mix.

Literally every single story I've read and heard leading up to this debate and throughout the entire campaign season has focused on those three individuals. Tuning to CNN last night it was much to my surprise to see five candidates on the stage. Let's leave Chaffee out of this (I'm not sure he was all there anyways), and focus on the other four.

So we know the story of Clinton, we know what Democratic Socialist Sanders stands for (it's reddit after-all), O'Malley might not be as well known, but he didn't give me much reason to want to know more about him. However there was this other fellow on stage who was captivating, Jim Webb.

From the first answer he gave last night he had my attention. 

Cooper asked ""Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?""

*No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race.*

What an answer? Am I right? 

It was a prelude to a night filled with some of the most reasonable and responsible rhetoric I'd ever heard from a candidate. This is coming from someone who considers themselves a Republican.

Some of the highlights:

When people were going on about the gun debate and talking about how we need more gun control, or I did this, or I voted for this... Webb comes through with the only answer that actually makes sense.

*Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that.*

*A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.*

*WEBB: So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.*

*COOPER: Senator...*

*WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.*

You can't ask people living in places where a police officer is more than 30 minutes or an hour away to not be able to protect themselves. Not everyone lives in urban Baltimore Mr. O'malley & not everyone has bodyguards 24/7 Mrs. Clinton.

When talking about military force and whether or not it should have been used in Lybia. Webb, once again takes the issue and breaks it down into the components that really need to be examined.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?*

*WEBB: Look, let's start -- I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.*

*Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.*

Talking about the things happening in the Middle East without equating the cause & effect is pointless. The candidates looked for the rebuttal their constituents wanted to hear. Webb, answered the question with facts.

Further supporting his view with reasons and basis for why it is what is:

*This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.*

*There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings.*

*It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.*

The conversation moved on to talk about Webb's decorated service and it is quite decorative. I sort of feel bad for only hearing about him last night, because the man is an American hero. When Cooper tried to engage him into calling out Sanders for dodging the Vietnam war. Webb eloquently said it's each mans choice, but that if you were looking for a Commander & Chief he is the most qualified. 

Isn't that true?

Who of those candidates, or of any on either side, are more qualified?

When Chafee tried to question Webb on his opinion that the Iran deal weakened America's position in the region. Webb once again retorted with a clear an accurate answer.

*I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.*

Btw, the only candidate to every mention Israel and our ally, in a debate which focused on the Middle East for a large swath of time.

Cooper asked each candidate what is the greatest threat to the U.S. Instead of giving an answer to a question that is way too complicated with a simplicity, like each other candidate did. Webb once again gives us an answer rooted in facts, understanding & reason-ability. 

*Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.*

Topics moved towards immigration and once again Webb seemed to be the only one that actually had a level headed approach to dealing with the issue. He was the only one on stage that said ""No country has -- is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue"". 

He actually presented a balanced answer that I think most Americans would support and his political history shows he has actually acted upon what he says. *I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.*

Every other candidate, especially O'Malley seem to think a country with no borders is a better America. I ask him to go look at how Europe is currently doing economically with those kinds of careless policies.

When talking about the NSA, Webb once again provides an answer that isn't just meant to rile up support, but actually rooted in reason. 

*We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought -- if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.*

Would anyone be opposed to that? We know we need to be protected, but that doesn't mean endless surveillance for endless time. I know I'm on video when I walk into a store, but that video doesn't need to be kept forever, and accessed by the privileged, if there is no reason. That's a sensible approach.

Speaking of sensible a lot of what was said on that stage is never going to happen. Sanders and his socialistic ideals are never going to pass in Congress. I know he wants a revolution, but Capitalist America isn't just going to become Denmark. 

Webb actually presented ideas that are possible, that can be done in a divided Congress. When asked about how he differed from Obama, he once again presents reasoned & accurate assessments.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?*

*WEBB: I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I -- Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.*

*I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead -- working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).*

It seemed like every candidate forgot that they wouldn't be issuing executive orders all day and that they would actually have to work with the Republicans to get things done. Can anyone tell me how in the hell Sanders would get anything that he wants done?

The conversation moved on to global warming. 

Candidates like O'Malley tried to tell us how we need wind turbines to fix our problems. Then Webb had his chance to defend his ""very different view"" as Cooper put it.

*You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are -- again, are you -- the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?*

*WEBB: Well, the -- the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?*

*And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.*

*We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on -- on doing that. The -- the agreements -- the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the -- of the Chinese government itself.*

*So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a -- a way to address climate change.*

Ding, ding, ding guess what Senator O'Malley Iowa's turbines don't mean anything when China & India are polluting the planet. To try and fix a global problem with domestic policy is quite possibly the most disingenuous thing one can do.

Webb wasn't given much of a chance to say the things he wanted, but when he forced his way into the conversation he said so much that made sense to me. He gave reasoned answers, he gave plausible solutions & he addressed concerns that so many either are unaware of, or have been sold a false narrative on.

Webb concluded his limited time with his closing statement:

*You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.*

*One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.*

*We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.*

*I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of -- of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.*

I always considered myself a Republican, but after watching the debate last night Senator Webb gave me a reason to believe in the Democratic party. I never thought I would say that. 

Webb is a man that I can stand behind and say, you know what, he actually represents me. He's not a career politician. He wasn't raised with a silver spoon. He has an immigrant wife who lived the American dream, and he wants to protect it. To make sure it exists for our future generations, like it did for her. He is a qualified Commander & Chief. 

Webb might not have been known by many before last night, but he certainly is known by many today. I hope those of you who think you already know who you are voting for will look at Webb and ask yourself, why not him. I know I will, and so far I haven't come up with a reason to say no.

TL;DR- Webb, a virtual unknown to many, came out on the debate stage and proved he is knowledgeable, qualified & reasonable. The only candidate that seems to be able to break the divide in Congress, the only one who isn't a career politician. Someone who wasn't raised with money & who's life is an example of the American Dream. Look at the debate and the things he said, and I think you too will come away with a greater appreciation for him.

Lawrence O'Donnell had David Frum [on his show on 2/27/17](http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/frum-there-may-be-security-risks-in-the-white-house-right-now-886243907996), along with Richard Stengel, where they discussed this. Here is a transcript from part of the interview, starting at just after 3:00: 

----

*Frum*: I'm here with a special commercial message, which is, please stop talking about a Special Prosecutor. A Special Prosecutor is a law enforcement official whose job it is to go find if crimes are committed. It's not illegal for an American citizen to have conversations with a hostile foreign intelligence agency. It's inappropriate, it's unethical, it's a security risk, but it's not a crime in most cases. So, this is a trap. It takes us down a path of legality. The thing we want to know is are there security risks inside the White House. It's not a crime to be a security risk, it's just dangerous to have them inside the White House. So, I plead for people to think, not in terms of a Special Prosecutor under the Special Council Law, but of an Independent Commision, run by Intelligence professionals, that has the power to identify security risks, and to recommend that they be excluded from government, and to go fast- because you don't want to wait for the legal process. You want to get security risks out of the government fast. And that is-- the higher up that person is positioned, the closer to the office of the Presidency that person is, the more important it is to get them out of office fast. 

*O'Donnell*: David quickly, just to complete your public service announcement, who do you want to appoint that Commission?

*Frum*: It will have to be appointed by Congress, and I don't have a lot of confidence in Congress right now, but public pressure is an amazing thing. The kind of people who should be running it, are people who have served at the highest levels in the Intelligence Community. Professionals, not lawyers.""

*O'Donnell*: So, Rick Stengel, a Commission which I will now sketch into shape, with appointees coming from the Democratic leadership of the Senate, the Democratic leadership of the House, and appointees coming from the Republican leadership of the Senate, the Republican leadership of the House. I think David makes a very good point: the limit, the problem with a Special Prosecutor at this stage, is that the limitation of the focus is on crime, and nothing but crime, and if the Special Prosecutor doesn't find crime, that Special Prosecutor might actually end up revealing nothing.

*Stengel*: I won't get into the statute, the laws passed after Watergate-- difference between Independent Council and Special Prosecutor-- the key word is ""independence"" here. So whether it's an Independent Commision, like 9-11, or an Independent Prosecutor, that's the key thing. But the thing I would add in my public service announcement, is that the investigation has to be larger than just the connection between Trump world and Russia. Russia has been trying to invade our domestic space, and influence our elections since 1982, which is in that great New Yorker article this week. They have been knocking on the door, and finally, they got someone to answer the door: Donald Trump. The ramifications for our democracy are huge. The investigation can't just be about Trump, but about how they're doing this and how Trump responded. Because Trump has played into their act. He has been what Lennin called a ""useful idiot"" to their efforts which noone has done since 1982.

*Frum*: I want to disagree with that. I mean, I agree with Richard Stengel, those are things that we want to know. I mean, there should be books written about them, but right now-- right now-- there are people in the West Wing with access to all kinds of secret information, including the names of American agents inside other countries, who may be security risks. You have to exclude them and you have to do it fast. I don't want members of Congress on this Commission. I want professionals-- the Commission must be appointed by Congress-- but make it go fast. Find the risks, identify them, and isolate them from power.

*O'Donnell*: So, Rick, I think we can all agree that an investigative priority would be individuals who are currently working in the White House, and working back from that, transition officials, where apparently there was a significant amount of contact, and then campaign officials.

*Stengel*: See the other thing that people forget to mention is that during the campaign, Donald Trump, candidate Donald Trump, quoted from Russia Today articles, quoted from Sputnik pieces that are Russian propaganda. That famous Sidney Blumenthal reference that he did was from a Sputnik piece. How Russia has infiltrated our campaign space is a very dangerous thing. I agree with David. There is an actual security risk right now that needs to be investigated.

The idea is quite interesting, and I want to understand whether it will result in success or not.

To fight the Kremlin, the Russian oppositionists from Navalny's team made a special service called ""Smart Voting"". This is a website where oppositionists are going to publish recommendations on voting in the upcoming elections to the Russian Parliament. The website will directly indicate which candidate you need to vote for. The main idea of this system is to consolidate the actions of voters to ensure the opposition gets maximum votes.

Sounds great, doesn’t it? The problem is that almost all parties running in the elections are controlled by Putin. Major “opposition” parties like the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia are actually Kremlin’s puppets.

The only party that seems to be the real opposition is the democratic party “Yabloko”. Still, for some reason, Navalny's followers barely include candidates from this party in their voting recommendations.

You might be wondering where the real opposition is. The answer is: real oppositionists are simply not allowed to participate in the elections.

Not everything that happens in the world is the president’s fault. Sometimes you are given a bad hand of cards, and you do the best you can do with those cards. 

Let’s take a look at the three overarching issues that have led to the cratered approval ratings of this administration: economy, pandemic, and war. 

The Trump administration, however you may feel about Trump, have enjoyed historic economic gains. Of course, these gains cannot be sustainable forever. As fast as the economy shoots up, it’s destined to come back down. Anyone, even if it were Trump in office now, would see these historic inflations.  Because historic gains lead to historic inflations, and we have a recession about every 10 years in this country. So how has the Biden admin dealt with this issue? Biden has sent out money to everyone to help stimulate the economy and is currently raising interest rates to slow down inflation, while also being careful as to not crumble the economy. 

Secondly, we have Covid. That’s an unforeseen and frankly, unstoppable, pandemic that could have happened no matter who’s in office. Again, we must look to how this administration has reacted to it. The Biden admin distributed testing and vaccines nationwide, at record volumes and record speed. But viruses, as viruses naturally do, have mutated and now we have various forms of Covid to deal with. This pandemic is an ongoing problem that we’ll probably wrestle with in some form for the next decade. 

Finally, we have war. Russia decides to attack Ukraine and the world has to figure out how to deal with this. Fighting back with troops is out of the question, since no one in their right mind wants world war 3. Short from war, Biden and his European allies have done everything else. Give weapons to Ukraine? Check. Sanction Russia? Check. It’s so severe that the Russian economy is crumbling before our eyes, and innocent Russian people are suffering. But this was a a sacrifice that needed to be made to respond to Putin. 

So, that leads us, to why the Biden administration sees itself with terribly low approval ratings. Is it because the Biden admin hasn’t been public enough touting their own efforts and achievements?  Is it because after all of this, the public still doesn’t feel like the Biden admin hasn’t done enough? Is it because no one knows or cares about what the Biden admin has done, but seeing food and gas prices as historically high prices is enough to lose confidence in this administration? 

Where is the disconnect?",PoliticalDiscussion,Russia

19,Megathread: Senate Intel Committee Releases Final Report Detailing Ties Between 2016 Trump Campaign and Russian Interference,60059.0,ic2tq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ic2tq0/megathread_senate_intel_committee_releases_final/,7432.0,1597763545.0,"A sprawling report released Tuesday by a Republican-controlled Senate panel that spent three years investigating Russia’s 2016 election interference laid out an extensive web of contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russian government officials and other Russians, including some with ties to the country’s intelligence services.

The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, totaling nearly 1,000 pages, provided a bipartisan Senate imprimatur for an extraordinary set of facts: The Russian government undertook an extensive campaign to try to sabotage the 2016 American election to help Mr. Trump become president, and some members of Mr. Trump’s circle of advisers were open to the help from an American adversary.

The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, in a late-night announcement Tuesday, said that 'pursuant to a subpoena' Mueller has agreed to appear before both panels on July 17.

'Americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia's attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign's acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) in a statement. ''We look forward to hearing his testimony, as do all Americans.''

28,Megathread: U.S. Intelligence Told Lawmakers of Russian Strategy to Boost Trump Re-Election,56699.0,f72zp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f72zp5/megathread_us_intelligence_told_lawmakers_of/,7710.0,1582246088.0,"Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.

The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.

During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.

That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.

45,Megathread: Michael Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting,52243.0,9289mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9289mr/megathread_michael_cohen_claims_trump_knew_in/,9427.0,1532655173.0,"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.

Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.

Stone was arrested in 2019 during the Mueller investigation, found guilty of making false statements and obstructing an investigation, and sentenced to 40 months in prison. Earlier on Friday, Stone's attempt to appeal the sentence was dismissed by the District of Colombia Circuit Court of Appeals.

President Trump had tweeted about Stone's sentence numerous times in recent weeks. Last week, he tweeted that Stone was ""a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt, one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history. He can sleep well at night!""

Barr’s handling of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, saying that Mr. Barr put forward a ""distorted"" and ""misleading"" account of its findings and lacked credibility on the topic.

Judge Reggie B. Walton said Mr. Barr could not be trusted and cited ""inconsistencies"" between his statements about the report when it was secret and its actual contents that turned out to be more damaging to President Trump. Judge Walton said Mr. Barr’s ""lack of candor"" called ""into question Attorney General Barr’s credibility and, in turn, the department’s"" assurances to the court.

67,Megathread: Bernie Sanders in narrow win over Buttigieg in the New Hampshire Democratic primary,47515.0,f2lv20,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f2lv20/megathread_bernie_sanders_in_narrow_win_over/,22736.0,1581483432.0,"Bernie Sanders narrowly won the New Hampshire Democratic primary by a margin of about 4,000 votes, or less than 2 percentage points, over Pete Buttigieg, according to an NBC News projection.

Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont, had been leading in the polls, so his victory wasn’t a surprise. But he and Buttigieg were closely bunched with the third-place candidate, Amy Klobuchar, allowing all three to claim either victory or solid momentum going into the next round of voting.

At the same time, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were headed toward poor showings and failed to get any delegates, NBC News projected.

Among those pardoned was George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to federal officials as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

Also pardoned was Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2018 in connection with the special counsel’s inquiry. Both men served short prison sentences.

197,Megathread: US Special Counsel recommends firing Kellyanne Conway over alleged Hatch Act violations,32706.0,c08xvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c08xvw/megathread_us_special_counsel_recommends_firing/,3655.0,1560448017.0,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal watchdog agency recommended Thursday that President Donald Trump fire one of his most ardent defenders, counselor Kellyanne Conway , for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity by government workers.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which is unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller’s office, said in a letter to Trump that Conway has been a 'repeat offender' of the Hatch Act by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are exempt from the Hatch Act, but there are no exceptions for White House employees.

The agency does not have authority to fire Conway, who was appointed counselor by Trump, so it would up to the president to follow its recommendation and dismiss one of his most unwavering defenders.

As of this date, March 3, 2022, Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, in much the same way as I have predicted here and elsewhere.  The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

I originally submitted on December 8, 2021, before Reddit Admins decided to [censor all Russian domains, in response to Putin's invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/t66l5f/reddit_blocked_all_domains_under_russian_cctld_ru/).  Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:

**********
**********

After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",geopolitics,Russia

The [current turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/europe/belarus-protests-guide.html) resulted.  As is fairly common in certain Eastern European elections, the 80% margin by which he claimed victory gives rise to obvious doubts as to legitimacy.  Mass protests and demonstrations resulted.  Lukashenko has 'won' past elections by similar margins, at least 85-90%+.  Lukashenko has arrested most of his political opponents, and jailed or exiled others.  Journalists which report on the extent of his corruption (of which there is no shortage) tend to find themselves in prison.  His title as Europe's so called 'last dictator' is well deserved.  

**The Global Response to Lukashenko's Purported Re-Election**

The global response to Lukashenko's purported re-election has been largely as would be anticipated.  Western countries -- and specifically the United States, through Mike Pompeo -- have expressed their reservations.  The results are self evidently suspect.  Despite this, Russia and China both endorsed the results and both countries have officially signaled their endorsement of the results.  Notably, Russia historically has been Belarus's strongest and closest ally, the animosity between Putin and Lukashenko in the recent years notwithstanding.   

**Uncertainty from Russia**

Despite the official endorsement from Putin, uncertainty remains as to the future of Russian and Belarusian bilateral relations.  Several prominent Russians, including those inside Putin's inner circle, have signaled that the Lukashenko's backing from Moscow is not guaranteed.  

Several developments this year contextualize the current status quo.  First, negotiations for discounted oil broke down in totality earlier in February 2020.  Russia not only suspended deliveries to Belarus, but offered future sales at ""[market rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-russia-putin.html)"" on a purely commercial basis.  Second, the oil negotiations broke down after Putin's proposal to merge the two countries was [flatly rejected](https://www.rferl.org/a/day-of-reckoning-as-pressure-mounts-belarusians-balk-at-prospect-of-russia-merger/30309691.html).  Natural gas sales were still discounted somewhat, but the lack of a market rate discount for oil sales to Belarus was a significant blow to the integrity of their relationship. 

The basic idea here is that when global oil prices were high, Russia could with very little significant loss discount its sales to Belarus to gain favor and geopolitical influence.  When oil prices bottomed out -- as they have in recent years -- the costs of that deal to Russia rose, so Russia sought to re-negotiate.  In the past, Lukashenko made few concessions (and in fact used the potential of closer ties with the West to extract that concession from Russia, consistent with his historical maneuvering of the animosity between Russia and NATO to his distinct advantage).  At the very least, Russia wanted closer economic (and by implication, political) integration; potentially, integration to the level of merging the two countries once Lukashenko left office.  Lukashenko predictably rebuked any such proposal. 

**Shrinking Russian Sphere of Influence**

From the outside looking in, it may not make sense why Russia would even want to integrate with Belarus.  All doubt however is resolved in consideration of how the other near and distant dominoes seem to be lining up -- each of them to fall outside the Russian sphere of influence.  Consider Kazakhstan, for example.  Nazarbayev (Kazakh president) has made deliberate efforts to broaden its economic and cultural reach outside the sphere of Russian influence, even to the point that he changed [the Kazakh alphabet](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41800186) from Cyrillic to Latin in 2017.   The idea was to draw a line in the sand relative to the scope and extent of Russian influence in Central Asia in general and Kazakhstan in particular. 

The fact that Russia hemorrhaged allied states following the USSR's collapse is a matter of historical record.  Thirteen Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO.  So, when Georgia endeavored to join the EU in 2007, Putin invaded Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- both of which remain allegedly ""disputed"" territories to this day.   A [highly deceptive](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/HUDOC_38263_08_Annexes_ENG.pdf) analysis concluded Georgia was to blame; but the whole reason Russia invaded in the first place was because Georgia was actively seeking NATO membership -- of course, to prevent exactly such an invasion.  In reality, Russia invaded a sovereign country for the purpose of preventing it from joining NATO.  Putin's response shows that in Russia's analysis, Georgia is better as a fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

A similar pattern played out in Ukraine.  As I have discussed before, when Ukraine sought closer economic and political integration with Western Europe and the United States, that was met with Russian meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics, even to the point of installing Yanukovych as Russia's puppet Ukrainian president.  Thereafter, in the face of maidan, Putin invaded eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea.  In the example of Ukraine as in Georgia, the outcome shows that Russia would prefer that Ukraine be a failed or fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

Recall that the goal here was for Putin to create an economic alliance in at least Eastern Europe and Central Asia to rival the EU, and ideally as an insurance policy against further sanctions.  The first step in that process would be developing individualized economic integration projects among each of the former Soviet bloc states.  Instead, Putin lost Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine in the span of less than a decade.  Ukraine was the first such integration project -- and that resulted in then-president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych's absconding Ukraine for Russia in disgrace. 

**So is Belarus next?**

Perhaps.  It's a question worth asking; especially considering what ""being next"" could mean.  

In a first set of possible worlds, Lukashenko is out because of his own decisions, or because he is forced out (potentially by the protesters, Russia or both).  In 2018-2019, when Russian-Belarusian bilateral relations were at their worst, it's conceivable that Putin might have tried something like he achieved in Ukraine -- but highly unlikely.  

It isn't obvious that Putin would be unwilling invade, given in particular the fact that he invaded Georgia and Ukraine under somewhat similar circumstances and that at this moment Lukashenko is very weak.  Lukashenko has never faced mass protests/demonstrations of this caliber before.  Putin has, and he survived them, but the public's dissatisfaction with Lukashenko's ""leadership"" is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, the consequential economic fallout attributable to the world's response to the coronavirus, and an increasingly ravenous lion to the east in its once-closer ally Russia.  

This combination of factors certainly suggests that if Moscow sees the opportunity to try to replace Lukashenko with someone more reliable to the Kremlin, that is exactly what the Kremlin would try to accomplish.   In that situation, Moscow would be re-running the same play-book it ran to get Yanukovych elected as president of Ukraine.  Even if such a far-fetched plan were to work -- and it almost certainly would not, in the short term or the long term -- who would take Lukashenko's place?  There is no one that would not leave Moscow worse off than they would be with Lukashenko.  While it's obvious why he's not ideal, given the recent history of strife between the two countries, there is no world where Russia's interests are -- at this time -- served by trying to replace Lukashenko with a Kremlin puppet.  

In the second set of possible worlds, Lukashenko remains and has to quell or pacify the Belarusian political unrest while maintaining ground against increasing Russian pressure.  To accomplish this, Lukashenko could do something like seek a trade deal with the EU, as both Georgia and Ukraine did.  But that would almost certainly would involve some kind of military response from Russia, just like Georgia and then Ukraine.  While there's an argument to be made that Lukashenko's historically closer relationship with Russia (however complicated) insulates him from the kind of retaliation Putin visited upon Georgia and Ukraine, he would still be playing with fire.  The Russian response to that kind of a bargaining chip from Russia would likely not come in the form of unwillingness to discount oil; it would come in the same form as was witnessed in Eastern Ukraine.  To be clear, neither Putin nor Lukashenko benefit in that case.  

The remaining option is most likely:  Lukashenko ""cracks down"" on the protests, and then everything goes back to normal.  

**Why Belarus is Different from Ukraine & Georgia**

As I wrote before, Belarus is not Ukraine.  Maidan in Ukraine was in direct response to Ukrainian government's preventing Ukraine from joining the EU.  The Ukrainian government opted for a counter-agreement with Russia instead.  In response, Ukrainians took to the streets and sought Yanukovych's resignation.  He subsequently fled to Russia.  There were other abuses that precipitated the demonstrations, like Yanukovych arresting his pro-democracy political opponents and arresting journalists who were reporting on the extent of his corruption, but the threshold moment was when Yanukovych tried to rebuke the democratic will of the Ukrainian people (shirk the EU in favor of the Kremlin).  So, for Ukraine, the goal was a clear and decisive move towards the EU and the United States (and NATO, by implication).  This was in response to decades of Kremlin meddling in Ukrainian domestic political affairs.  Maidan there was Ukraine setting forth a future for itself that did not include Putin.  

Belarus also isn't Georgia.  The purported underlying ethnic conflict behind the Russian invasion of Georgia was little more than an illusory pretext; Saakashvili's primary aim for Georgia was to become a NATO member and there was clear support for that in the Bush Administration because of the implications that would have to world oil markets.  Specifically, despite the fact that Georgia has no reserves of its own, a pipeline across Georgia would substantially decrease Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  Bush even outlined a pathway for both Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.  This was intolerable to Putin, and so he invaded as a result.  

Belarus and its present situation is almost wholly incongruous.  Belarus is now and has always been a far more authoritarian regime than Ukraine ever was, even at its worst.  Unlike Ukraine and Georgia, Belarus never made the initial step towards actual democracy that ultimately laid the foundation the Ukrainian maidan or the Georgian efforts to draw closer to the West.  Belarus also does not have ambitions of closer ties with the West, and the EU and Untied States in particular -- which Ukraine has sought for some time.  Lukashenko only ever used that as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from Moscow -- a fact of which Putin is invariably aware.  The riots taking place now in Belarus are not oriented towards any goal in particular, either.  It's arbitrary rage.  Even if they were oriented towards democratic reform, and it is not clear that they are, Belarus has no intention of divesting itself from the Russian sphere of influence -- however high the costs of maintaining that relationship may be.  

**Compromise / Cooperation best serve both Belarus's & Russia's Interests** 

If both Belarus and Russia act rationally, they will cooperate and compromise.  Russia will have little choice but to accept the fact that Belarus is not merging with Russia any time soon.  The costs of Russia's invading would be inexorably high.  There is no one in Belarusian politics that can replace Lukashenko that would be both able to preserve Belarus as a state and that would in the same instance be able to more effectively advance Moscow's interests.  Likewise, it is in Russia's interest that these riots and protests throughout Belarus come to and end -- as quickly and expeditiously as possible.  Political unrest in one totalitarian country has a tendency to spread to another; as Putin has experienced time and again, dating back to his time in Dresden through the present.  Further, this all comes at a time when Russian public confidence in Putin is at an all time low -- and the potential for another Moscow maidan (and perhaps one that might actually be successful) is at an all time high.  Given that, the more pertinent question in the final analysis might even be, if Lukashenko falls, is Putin next?  Their fates are tied together, whether they like it or not.",geopolitics,Russia

Probably because it upset some Chinese nationalists/pro-Chinese Quorans (Lin Xieyi comes to mind).

I posted it on Quora because I think it's important to debunk some of the ill-informed and simplistic opinions about Singapore's foreign policy toward China.

# Do Singaporeans agree with the ex-diplomat that China is exercising influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore?

At first I didn’t, or was undecided, but now I do.

If you are a PRC patriot, or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations, please stop reading now. It’s for your own good.

Let’s examine the source in question. Who was this “ex-diplomat”?

· Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs

· He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.

· He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.

· Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)

· He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy

· There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence…by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers

· It is possible that the government prefers to use “unofficial” means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives

Now let’s examine the substance of his argument.

That China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.

But Bilahari Kausikan’s concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore’s sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one’s own benefit

Now let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)

But this is not a valid excuse. People who employ this excuse are essentially saying “So what? everyone does it”. To quote the Chinese Ambassador’s response *“I would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different.”* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.

American influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.

But **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable. The appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring.**

**SPECULATION ON CHINA’S 2016-2017 INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN**

In August, Huang Jing was exposed for giving *“supposedly ""privileged information"" to a senior member of the LKY School, so it could be passed on to the Singapore Government. The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy”.*

About 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with “very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy”), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China’s rise.

I think we can put two and two together.

I do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani. I think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to. I have no doubt that he earnestly, sincerely believes in the views that he propounds. I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book “Has China Won?”. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.

When Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan’s comment: *“This is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'”*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)

Kausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)

If you don’t have time, I’ll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):

*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position…*

*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing’s influence operations stems from China’s triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*

*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order… On this first track of state-to-state relations, there’s nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*

*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it’s also a Leninist state…and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP’s “magic weapon”… the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party’s interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*

*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation’s history and culture, now rejuvenated…and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office… In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China’s interests and work to advance China’s interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the 华人 (ethnic Chinese) and the 华侨 (overseas PRC citizens)…*

*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China’s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*

*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride…Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel…But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*

*\[the narrative of China’s absolute rise and America’s inevitable decline\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called “useful idiots”.*

***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental…many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government…Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore’s interests with China’s interest.***

***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016–2017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***

***It’s clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don’t know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***

*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*

This is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.

​

**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**

What is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.

In its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.

This is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us “See, this is what you are doing! Stop it!”. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that “no, actually we’re not doing that. We’re doing THIS”.

**MYTH 1. Surely as a “Chinese country”, Singapore should “explain” China’s position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**

**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**

**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**

**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it “taking sides” with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**

**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn’t know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**

Let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.

**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a “Chinese country”. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore’s identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being “race traitors” by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a “Chinese” identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.

Yes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to “empathize” with it.

But it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China’s claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China’s interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China’s interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.

**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China’s rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US’ intrinsic strengths and some of China’s structural challenges.

China is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.

But what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China’s rise (Mahbubani’s included) tend to take the Whig view of history - “up and up and on and on”

The Chinese never tire of reminding us that China’s presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America’s presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America’s presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.

Asia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.

**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China’s stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.

This is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.

This myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.

Singapore’s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity “soft” balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than “hard” balancing against China and “hard” bandwagoning with the US.

By the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don’t blame him, I think it’s a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.

So, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.

**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.

Now, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China’s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.

And in case you think our statement on the PCA’s verdict was somehow “extreme” or “new”, let me read out the statement to you:

>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  
*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  
*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  
*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*

In other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as “taking sides”? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?

Let me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?

Note also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?

Non-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a “hiding” strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.

​

And while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore…and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?

*“I am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs…but when my security, Singapore’s survival, Singapore’s prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral”* \- Lee Kuan Yew

*“Singapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big ‘trees’ in the region”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *“now that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly…we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers”*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.

But has there been any fundamental change in Singapore’s policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.

The Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao’s China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a “running dog” of the West.

Lee Kuan Yew’s views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.

>*“The Chinese may make a miscalculation…they may become assertive and pushy, which is contrary to their long-term interest, which is to win over the smaller countries in the south to their side”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, 2011  
*“\[My uncle-in-law\] had this romantic idea that, you know, \[China\] is a land of my forefathers. I have no doubts that the land of my forefathers would have brought me down in the world…They (the Chinese) wanted me to contribute \[to my uncle-in-law’s manor house which the Chinese refurbished and made into a historic tourist site\]. I said no, no, I’m not Chinese, I’m Singaporean, I’m not going to visit the place…I have no romantic view about where I sprang from. I’m very grateful that my great grandmother who was born here decided she’s not going to go back (to China) with her husband because she doesn’t know China…I’m a lucky fellow. Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea…I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different. Their dress, their manners, their language. They are a different lot, that’s all. They come from a different society. Of course, at the end of the day they are Chinese.”* \-Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“That romantic idea of going back to the bosom of your motherland is a delusion. We have become different, that’s all. You can go back to China, you’re still different…If you go to China, I don’t think you will belong. They’ll say okay, we’ll accept you. But look at even the Malayan communist cadres who sent their families and children there…- nevertheless, they were treated differently…You think you’re Chinese , and that you will blend in, but you will not. You are already different. We are already different. Just like the American and the British people, or for that matter, the South African whites, Australians, New Zealanders and the British. The Taiwanese mainlanders and Chinese mainlanders, who have not stayed in Taiwan, yes, they are same stock, same heritage, but had different exposure, different standpoints, different views of the world. Are we Chinese? Yes, ethnically. Can we sit down with the Chinese and really feel part of them? Not possible. Because you speak Chinese? No. Your major premises are in your mind” - Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011*  
*“\[The Chinese\] expect us to be more respectful - you must respect me. They tell us countries big or small are equal, we’re not a hegemon, 不称霸. But when we do something they don’t like, they say you have made 1.3 billion people unhappy … So please know your place”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“I do not see Singapore surviving on the Chinese economy. If we spoke only Chinese, we would not be today’s Singapore. What is the difference if China is ten times stronger? It will make us ten times stronger? No. Our prosperity comes from linkages with the world…the future is the same. We are not Hainan Island. We are not Hong Kong, where they have no choice. We are in the centre of an archipelago of great diversity, with rich natural resources, and the world will come here”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“How can \[the Chinese object to the American logistics hub here\]? That is crude. If they ask us to stop the logistics base, our answer would be: you can use the logistics base and store your equipment here (so we would host both the Chinese and Americans”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into ‘conscribe’, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am Chinese. They are hypersensistive”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“You have to accept the fact that they (China) are the biggest boy in the neighbourhood. They will not be the biggest in the Pacific because the US will always be there to counterbalance them. But increasingly, they would be able to keep the US away from the coastal regions. That’s a development we have to accept. No more \[uncomfortable for Singapore\] than for the other countries…It’s even more tricky for Vietnam. We have no conflict of interest with China…we have no such overlapping claims with them.”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**CONCLUSION**

Let me emphasize again: I see the rise of China as a good thing in the long-term. It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China’s own behaviour.

But in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore’s own national interest - determined by Singaporeans’ own choices ALONE and no one else’s, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I’m only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.

Huang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy. When they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive space, we must continue to quietly, tactfully, but ruthlessly** ***slice those fingers off.***

*Russia has begun mobilizing troops along its border with Ukraine, presenting a fresh challenge at the Biden administration and threatening to upend a cease-fire between Ukraine and pro-Russian fighters.*   


 A German source (NTV) reported today:

*Russia has called troop movements near its border with Ukraine a self-protection measure. ""On Russia's borders, the activities of NATO, other alliances and individual states are increasing,"" a presidential office spokesman said. ""All this obliges us to be vigilant."" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that an escalation in the Donbass region could destroy Ukraine*

[https://icds.ee/en/rumours-of-war-another-russian-surprise-in-ukraine/](https://icds.ee/en/rumours-of-war-another-russian-surprise-in-ukraine/)   

(That source is worth a read to get a good understanding of the current situation)

  *- 20th of January 2021: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov issued an ‘ultimatum’: ‘If the setting (ustanovka) \[does not change\], then we will rearrange our actions accordingly’.*  
*-Calls to annex the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). On 28 January vom chief editor von RT*  
*- On 3 March the ‘national militia’ of the DPR announced that they would launch pre-emptive strikes in defence against ‘Ukrainian terror’*  
*- In recent weeks two themes, each more lurid than the other, have risen up the scale of Russian media coverage: Ukrainian massing of forces for a decisive offensive and the certainty of devastating Russian reprisals*

Troop movements can be considered rather normal, but having propaganda being broadcasted and lavrov being extremely aggressive and threatening surprised me a little bit.  That looks like a rather holistic move.

Russia and Ukraine are building up their forces near the conflict zone. The question is, why? This analysis will try to go into some of the potential end game scenarios and explain why it is happening. The reader should not take this article for anything else than an analysis from a hobby enthusiast.*

**The show of force**

The most likely reason seen is Russia trying to muscle itself in front of Kyiv and Washington. Many experts say the recent Russian military movement does not comprise sufficient force for a conventional Ukraine invasion. With Russia's military posturing, it appears to be primarily coercive and demonstrative in nature as of now.

This argument is backed up by the fact that Russia's Western Military District has, per April 3, not mobilised key regiments and divisions that would likely be necessary to support an offensive against Ukraine. Moreover, Russia has also not built up the required logistical depots — including fuel, ammunition, and medical supplies — for a major offensive. Although there might infrastructure left from the many skirmishes and threats of escalation the last seven years, it is less likely western and Ukrainian intelligence would not have picked it up.

The third point is the lack of stealth and subtlety in the military build-up. If an offensive were the primary goal, the Russian military would not have openly telegraphed ongoing deployments, according to Mason Clark, lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. \*\* On Telegram, Twitter and other Social Media, there are many pictures and videos of the troop deployment that makes it easy to follow the movement.

The timing has also been an argument against an invasion. Right now Ukraine and Russia are at that time of the year called Rasputitsa. The time where travelling on unpaved roads or across the country is difficult and definitely be a disadvantage for an attacking force. 

**The Peacekeepers**

The second reason that might explain Russia's action if preparing for a military campaign is to get Russian ""peacekeepers"" in the Donbas region. Russia has denied and official military forces inside the area, blaming all Russian casualties or prisoners as voluntary soldiers without Moscow's orders. A triggering event, either natural or fake, can provide Russia with the Casus Belli to move into Donbas after an ""invitation"" of the local government in the pretence of protecting Russian citizens.

It would have the merit of preserving existing territorial arrangements, at least outwardly, yet it would allow for the revival of military operations at any moment required by Moscow. Moreover, it is the one military option that fits observable evidence: the movement of forces from Russia and local reserves' mobilisation.\*\*\*

**The (water) invasion**

The least likely option, but not impossible, is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, of all the analysts found, no one saw this as the main reason for the Russian forces' escalation in the region. Often the Crimea Water crisis is an argument as a reason for war.\*\*\*\*

A forced takeover action of the canal from the Russian military should be considered a last resort, given that the cost of such an operation for Russia would significantly exceed the possible benefit in almost any category.

To try would mean it would be necessary to capture more than 70 km of Ukrainian territory up to the left bank of the Kakhovka reservoir, which would meet strong resistance from a different Ukrainian military that was in 2014 and also entail new sanctions.

Simultaneously, the decommissioned canal has deteriorated in the last seven years, and without a significant overhaul, Russia would lose most of the water during transmission. The canal will also serve as a high-risk target for sabotage from the Ukrainian military, demanding many resources to protect it.

An invasion in this degree would be based on more goals or motivation than just water for Crimea.

*So what is the reason for this escalation?*

**Testing a new President**

When Trump took over the Presidency in 2017, there was a celebration in the Kremlin. However, the party soon ended as both sanctions, and the distance between Washington and Moscow continued. In some ways, the pressure on Russia increased. Trumps administration sent and approved the use of the Javelin missiles for frontline duty. A much welcome weapon to combat Russian tanks for the Ukrainian military, although not a gamechanger. \*\*\*\*\*\*

Biden presidency has early shown its support to Ukraine, and the recent escalation might be to see how far the new administration is willing to go. Putin might hope that Biden is a continuation of the Obama presidency, a man that Putin did not take seriously. However, the Russian President might be disappointed. Biden history in US politics goes back to the 70s, and he has experience both with Putin's Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union.

**Stopping a new Zelensky**

Something happened with the Ukrainian President in 2021. First, he stopped three pro-Russian tv channels from the air, and then sanctions hit the country's oligarchs, even the owner of the tv channel that made Zelensky famous, Ihor Kolomoyskyi. These events could be seen as a domestic issue, supported by the US to approve his falling approval ratings. Then the real bombshell hit. On February 19, Viktor Medvedchuk was put on the Ukrainian sanctions list due to the financing of terrorism.

Medvedchuk has been named Putin's man in Ukraine, and the Russian President is also the godfather of Medvedchuks, daughter. A man who has always been in the centre of Ukrainian politics and who always have promoted Russian interest. The sanctions made him powerless in the country. Zelensky could not have made such a move without guarantees from an ally more powerful than national oligarchs and Russia. The fact is that within two months, Ukraine has taken down a pro-Russia propaganda network that took years to build up. It must have been a surprise for both Medvedchuck and the Kremlin to see him being played out on the sidelines so quickly.

**The Nagorno ghost**

The war in Nagorno Karabakh might have ushered us into a new age of warfare, the age of drones. The conflict, where Armenia was supported by Russian arms and Azerbaijan by Turkish, was almost a walkover for the Azerbaijani forces. Turkish drones destroyed Russian bought tanks and armour.

Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones became overnight a weapon in demand, and one of the first buyers was Kyiv, who already have managed to put 6 of them in use. A joint venture between Ankara and Kyiv has also been made Russia's headache, which now must use more resources to research and incorporate drone warfare into its armed forces. The JV is seen as a win-win situation as Ukraine establish a new market and military capabilities, while Turkey might avoid western arms sanctions.§

However, it is to be noted that, like the Javelins, the drone programme is not a game-changer. Still, it puts another weapon in Ukraine's arsenal that again demands more resources to counter. In that sense, it is not surprising to see that the Russian is transporting the S-300 missile or other SAM system near Ukraine. This system might be permanently positioned in Donbas, as evidence suggests that drone use has been a severe problem to the separatists on the front line. In a simple sentence, after seven years, Ukraine has found an area of warfare where Russia lags.

All countries bordering Russia, except China, strategies a war with Russia on the following equation: How much damage can we inflict before Russia sees it as not worth it. The best window for Russia was in 2014.

Although Ukraine is still heavily shorthanded, especially the navy, no one can argue against the progress made. Russia will win if this is one to one conflict, but the costs will most likely be high; many believe it's too high.

First is the idea that Russia is a declining power whose aggression towards its neighbors is borne of weakness, not strength. It is a defensive power with great strategic depth, but is riddled with weak demographics, a moribund economy, crippling and systemic corruption, an outdated military, and woeful social indicators from alcoholism to suicide to life expectancy. Its GDP is now 8% of the U.S. and 12% of China's (by far the biggest gap in more than a century). It is falling rapidly in the economic totem pole and peak oil will be its deathknell.

Second is the idea that Russia is a rising power whose tactical acumen on the world stage places it firmly in the space of the great powers. It is one of the Top 4 ""pillars"" of the geopolitical structure - along with China, the European Union and the United States, and their ties to the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America give them a major strategic advantage. Their frozen conflict inroads into Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova,  and their big stick diplomacy against Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, etc. are proof of Russia's growing might. They can outmaneuver both the EU and USA with ease and have manager the enviable feat of subverting Western democracy and institutions at pennies on the dollar.

What I intend to bring to you today is my own, unprofessional (but hopefully respectful of the rules of reporting information in an unbiased manner that I learned in my own field of study) analysis of the predicament that Poland finds herself in, the dangers ahead and the hopes for the future. Or to put it in more dramatic terms, I'd like to outline for you what geopolitically-minded Poles believe needs to go right for Poland to survive as an independent state and what they fear could go wrong.  

I need to warn you in advance that this is not an academic paper, there won't be citations of scholarly literature after each claim. My ""sources"" are a mixture of lectures from both [Polish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3xu1zimPVw&t=2s) and [foreign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7AgYqoaNs) observers of the subject, various [think tank events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dckWnhSO-EA) and [reports](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html), [articles from more specialized media](https://www.defence24.com/geopolitics/), as well as my own understanding of situation in a broader historical context, my own attempts to read between the lines of what the relevant world leaders are saying as well my perception of the mood in the country sampled from ""the word on the street"".  
If that seems insufficient to you, please keep in mind that my aim is not to bring you any shocking revelations and trend-setting conclusions. I merely wish to present to you the various ways in which more or less geopolitically-conscious Poles think and talk about the present and future of their country. So without further ado, let's begin:  

**The Stage**  

Poland is in its current shape and geographic location strategically indefensible and its geopolitical position independently untenable. With no significant natural barriers in either direction, in her 1000 years of history, independent Poland has never existed for long with greater powers to both West and East. That said, it's important to state that as tragic as the country's flat and indefensible geography is, the part of the Northern European Plain it's situated on is also the narrowest in the North-South direction and along with Ukraine constitutes a gateway between East and West. When Poland controlled most of those lands, her curse was also her blessing and contributed in a major way to Commonwealth's status as a great power. Poland lacking control of the entireity of this gate reaps none of the benefits of having a say who comes through and faces all of the threat of being in the way.  
Poland's current sovereignty can be attributed almost entirely to a ""freeze"" in great power politics brought on by the establishment of the so called ""Rules-Based Global Order"" introduced by the United States following World War 2 in order to bring the Western states together to help America stand against the Soviets.  
After the collapse of the USSR, a decision was made to maintain said order and invite Poland, along with other countries liberated from the Communists who were ready to take that offer, to the club, resulting in Poland joining NATO in 1997 and the EU in 2004. This, along with drastic and arguably haphazard, but comprehensive liberalization reforms carried out in the early 90s, resulted in steady growth of prosperity, culminating in Poland officially joining the ranks of developed countries in 2018.  

**The Predicament**  

Given Poland's unfortunate geography and relatively small population and economy, it can never realistically hope to stand against hostile foreign incursions of both hard and soft power without outside help. That makes it so that what Poland needs above all is a powerful and reliable ally with a vested interest in Poland existing as an independent state. This notion is as obvious today as it was in the inter-war period, but just as back then the allies proved not rich enough in the above qualities to keep Poland from Stalin, the fear is that should the Global Rules-Based Order unravel further, the same will prove to be true once again.  
Of course, great many people in Poland are free from that fear, trusting in lasting endurance of NATO as deterrence to outside threats and the EU continuing to be a stable environment for Poland to thrive in and increase her prosperity and it's entirely possible that they may prove to be correct, but we're not here to look at the world from a perspective in which geopolitical realities are assumed to be put on hold indefinitely.  

**The Dangers**  

The more things change the more they stay the same, the mortal threats to Polish sovereignty remain Russia and Germany. I'll start with Germany as that's the part that already raised more eyebrows and objections and I need to quickly clarify that educated, reasonable Poles on the most part don't consider Germany to be hostile to Poland or believe that it will turn hostile in the future. The threat I am talking about pertains to the sovereignty of Poland, not to Polish lives and basic individual freedoms and the loss of said sovereignty is to happen through further gradual osmosis of German soft power into its weaker neighbour, accelerated by further institutional integration within the EU (especially if conditions of this integration would be unfavourable to Poland), not armed conflict of any kind.  
A large segment of Polish society, what could be roughly described as ""liberals"", considers that outcome to be acceptable if not desirable. Some believe that by the time it happens, we will all be a one big European family and it won't matter who's stronger than who, some concede that it's the only option and it will happen no matter what, so there's no point fighting it and some even believe that being de facto governed by German politicians is prefereable to living under a Polish government. The ""conservatives"" largely see the threat of German domination as one of the main arguments against further European integration, but it's important to note that Poland still remains the most pro-EU country in Europe. I'll come back to that topic later.  

Now let's discuss Russia. Poles view Russia most unfavourably out of any nation in the world and there is virtually no diplomatic dialogue between the two countries. When you say ""foreign threat"" in Poland, you're saying ""Russia"", when Polish army trains, it trains against Russia, when Polish MOD buys equipment, people will judge the purchase based on how they think it will fare against what the Russians have. Polish politicians have to bite their tongue not to call Russia ""enemy"" when speaking publicly and the guy who tried to start a pro-Russian political party ended up locked in jail, because he was found out to be an agent.  
The reason for that is that everyone barring a handful of fringe political groups, especially from the extreme right, recognizes that Polish and Russian interest in the region are fundamentally irreconcilable, the same as they ever were.  
Other than the need for good allies, what is also universally recognized in Poland is that the country would greatly benefit economically and strategically from being neighboured by friendly, like-minded countries to the East. **Continued independence of the Baltics as well as integration of Ukraine and hopefully Belarus into the political and economic sphere where Poland resides are vital geopolitical interests of Poland.** Securing these latter two goals would push the Russian threat further away (I don't want to use the term ""buffer zone"", since that term has very negative connotations when applied to this part of the world due to what Russians understand by it), make Poland less periferial in this community of nations and preferably allow it to extert the same kind of influence that Germany exterts on Poland.  
Russia has obviously other plans for the region and I have to leave it at that, because explaining the point of view of Russia is a monumental task that goes far beyond the scope of this post.  
Now an important question is what geopolitically-literate persons in Poland exactly fear from Russia. Few consider an outright invasion of Poland to be a real possibility in circumstances remotely resembling the ones we have today, although it's important to note that according to most analysts and recently conducted war games, from a purely-strategic point of view and based on concentration of troops in the region, Russia is perfectly capable of swiftly beating Polish forces and forcing them to retreat beyond Vistula assuming access through Belarus.  
A more realistic scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the aforementioned countries of interest forcing Poland to either react and risk potentially even nuclear retaliation or concede to being encroached on by a threat that could one day turn existential.  
A specific and the most relevant example of such a scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the Baltic states. Assuming Belarussian neutrality (which is the better option for Poland), the aid provided to the Baltics would need to come through the Suwałki gap (the strip of land where Poland borders Lithuania) which is not possible due to the concentration of the area-denial missile systems in the exclave of Kaliningrad. To open the passage, those area-denial system must first be destroyed. So **in order to protect her vital geostrategic interests, Poland would need to get a go-ahead from her more powerful Western allies (i.e. United States) to attack Russian territory, destroy crucial Russian assets and risk starting a nuclear war.** Or go at it alone and get smacked down by Russia eventually. Nobody assumes that Poland has the green light to provoke a nuclear war, so that's a serious headache. And it gets worse.  

**The Future**  
*or riding two horses into the storm*   

As bad as being expected by your stronger allies to be the first to confront a greater threat without knowing how much political will to support you if you do there is, it gets worse without them. With increasing talks of a) EU wishing to become independent from US militarily b) American leadership reconsidering its commitments to Europe and shifting its attention towards Asia and (I don't want to make this political in the internal sense, but it would be dishonest not to mention it) c) Polish government's universally condemned transgressions against the system of democratic checks and balances weakening Poland's claim of entitlement to protection by the Rules-Based Order by default, Poland might soon face a situation where failing to secure firm commitment from one of her allies will leave her with none. Which one of those allies should Poland stake her chips on is the essence of the geopolitical debate in Poland and that's regardless of whether the participants realize that what they're talking about is geopolitics or not. If you exclude the fringe, and in my personal view, ignorant propositions that Poland should either stand alone against the world or cozy up to Russia (A sidenote: there is an intriguing notion that Russia might be willing to extend a very sweet deal to Poland to secure our non-interference in the next Russian adventure, but if such a thing was to happen, it would be because Poland is a problem for Russia, not because they like us, so that's not an argument for being pro-Russian before that happens), what we're left with are two directions, doctrines or options:  

**The Atlantic Option**  

Proponents of the Atlantic Option will tell you that Poland is a prime candidate to serve as a continental anchor for the atlantic sea powers of United Kingdom and United States and it's reasonable to expect those countries to be interested in keeping us an ally. The idea is that Americans and the British have a use for Poland as a form of a wedge between Germany and Russia keeping those countries from consolidating into something that could threaten them.  
Its opponents will tell you that Poland is on the wrong side of the Jutland peninsula to be the continental anchor and that turning our back on EU and clinging onto Americans for dear life like we currently do without even knowing if they will care about what happens in Europe is misguided. Whether the latter will prove to be true or not, the apparent pros of this option are enticing. For one, US being the (increasingly doubted, but still reigning) military hegemon and being too far to extert the kind of dominating influence a neighbour could, is the perfect ally for Poland assuming their commitment. And Americans, whether they mean it or not, assure us of their commitment at every occasion, so for as many things as you can fault our government, not being eager to mistrust them is not one of them. Secondly, to serve as this wedge, Poland would need to be in a decent shape not only militarily, but also economically and being economically propped-up by the largest economy on the planet (in nominal GDP, I know) is again a mouth-watering perspective. Finally a firm alliance with America would likely imply encouragement and support for Poland to extend its influence to the the countries of interests I mentioned earlier in order to incorporate them into the wedge, whereas European states could just easily have them for themselves.  
As for the cons, other than the lack of certainty of reciprocity, they are as follows:  
- being America's great landing strip would put us in greater danger than a humble existence within EU would  
- many people strongly favour European values and the institutions that foster them over American flavour of freedom with its for-profit prisons and things of this sort  
- turning our back completely on EU if we were ever forced to could be economically suicidal to the point where even the mighty US couldn't subsidize us out of poverty given how deeply Polish economy is integrated with the EU, especially Germany  

For now, despite the threat of United States turning its attention entirely to Asia (or even, God forbid, sacrificing us to Russia for their aid there), electing an islolationist president or an idealist president who deems alliance with Poland not worth tolerating our leaders' encroachment on democratic values, or even the possibility that when things get too tense, the Americans will reveal that they never cared that much to begin with, we put our faith in the Atlantic Option. That's a long list of cons and despites, which is understandable why many people prefer

**The Continental Option**  

The Continental Option stakes Poland's security on firm integration with the EU. Its proponents believe that just as good EU was for us economically as an economic union, it will be good for us militarily as a military union. They reasonably posit that Poland, being a country with a major interest in security matters, should jump at Macron's invitation to form a EU army and place their allegiance there instead of USA in matters like military equipment procurement and the choice of foreign expeditions, eventually even aiding in going against the interests of the United States should that ever happen to be good for Europe. They believe that a deeply united Europe would be a formidable force that nobody would dare confront and that a membership in this organization is more than enough to keep Poland safe. The problems with this approach vary from obvious, like the fact that no European country has currently any real capability to project significant force into Poland or the fact that major European powers don't share the same attitude to Russia as we do (see: Nord Stream 2), to very controversial like potentially questionable long term viability and stability of the union itself. The last problem, which I hinted at before, is the notion that even if things go splendidly in terms of ensuring Poland's security, integrating our armed forced into a structure that's in large part controlled by states which may not have our best interests in mind in matters less drastic than foreign incursions will result in finalizing the de facto loss of sovereignty that a deep integration into the EU entails. As many potential flaws as there are with this deal, it seems to be the one that is more likely to remain on the table should our worries about the direction the world is going were to materialize.  

**Conclusion**

As you can see, given that both options are, however much needed, far from perfect and in a nightmare scenario it's possible that neither will be avaliable or sufficiently realized when needed, if Poland is ever forced to choose (and we're not here to proclaim The End of History and state that it never will), it's reasonable to expect that things will never be as good as they are now that we have the luxury of enjoying all the military and economic boons that a one, amicable community of nations has to offer us.  
It's important to note that both sides of the debate have arguments with merit and it's near-impossible to objectively attribute the correct amount of weight to them without countless preconceptions and biases getting in the way. **It's a difficult and important debate and its outcome could determine not only the fate of countries that along with Poland would need to radically reconsider how they see their security situation, but even significantly influence the nature of the future relationship between United States and European Union.**

Minsk (in a move similar to Turkey's last year action) is flying migrants from Middle East to Belarus, and forcing them, using military forces, towards UE's borders. This move, straight from hybrid warfare's playbook, is already causing some political and social destabilisation in Polish media dispute, causing unreasonable actions of politicans from both sides. 

The border crisis is fueled on the eve of Zapad '21, massive military manouvers in Belarus and Russia's western districts. Yesterday, news emerged about Russia mobilizing 50k reservists this month, scale unseen since the fall of USRR.

If there is a will in Moscow to test credibility of NATO in a limited capacity, for example by ""accidential"" crossing of border by some training units, through the Suwalki Gap, the timing to do this might be better then ever. USA credibility has taken a hit in Afghanistan, Poland is not received well in the West due to undemocratic actions of its government.

58,Why was the British Empire so successful?,703.0,i8d413,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i8d413/why_was_the_british_empire_so_successful/,241.0,1597236447.0,"The British Empire was one of the largest empires that ever existed. British school children could see in their textbooks that one fourth of the globe was colored in red and they must have been proud of it. However, the British empire never had an army as large as France or Germany. It never had a population as large as China or Russia. British technology, although impressive, was not something out of this world. Then why were the British so successful?

After having read a few books about the British Empire (ie. Unfinished Empire, Empire project), it seems to me that the British Empire was more akin to a multinational corporation like Apple of Google. 

For example, Apple provides a useful **platform** for creative and innovative developers and each creator can amass wealth and prestige by developing first class Apps which catch the attention of consumers around the world. In the same vein, the British Empire provided a platform (finance, communication, transport, trade network) for different stakeholders to amass wealth and prestige. 

Chinese merchants in Canton traded with the East India Company and they became rich. Houqwa is the best known example. Some even say that he was one of the richest persons of the early 19th century. Indian merchants, especially the Parsi(Persians), collaborated with the British and they also became rich. Jews from Europe and the Levant, and also from Baghdad joined the Empire and traded with East Asia. The renown Sassoon family is one of them. They were originally from Baghdad but migrated to India and familiarized with the British. The great conglomerate which rules India to this day -  the Tata group -  came also from an illustrious merchant family which did business with the British Empire.

British corporations which dominated China, namely the HSBC, Jardine & Matheson and Swire & Co employed not only white people from Britain but also other Europeans and many Chinese. Actually, those Chinese who worked for them established their own private companies, including banks and factories. They were not traitors to their countrymen, but skilled managers. Even Li Hung Chang, the so called Bismarck of China, hired them to modernize his fatherland. 

Wealthy Germans and French, regardless of any national sentiment of enmity, also invested in Britain and they allocated their wealth in British banks. And unskilled laborers from Malaysia had better chance of earning an income by working for a British company than in other places. 

In other words, Britain provided a ""platform"" for self-enrichment to a myriad of different groups regardless of faith or race. **What came to be the British Empire was in reality a complex network of colluding interests.** 

A passage from *Unfinished Empire* (2012) gives an exquisite illustration of the essence of the British Empire.

>""The island of Singapore... the government, the garrison and the chief merchants are English but the great mass of the population is Chinese, including some of the wealthiest merchants, the agriculturists of the interior, and most of the mechanics and laborers. the native Malays are usually fishermen and boatmen, and they form the main body of the police. The Portuguese of Malacca supply a large number of clerks and smaller merchants. The Klings of Western India are a numerous body of Mohammedans, and, with many Arabs, are petty merchants and shopkeepers. The grooms and washermen are all Bengalese, and there is a small but highly respectable class of Parsee merchants. Besides these there numbers of Javanese sailors and domestic servants, as well as traders from Celebes, Bali, and many other islands of the Archipelago. The harbour is crowded with men-of-war and trading vessels of many European nations, and hundreds of Malay praus and Chinese Junks...little fishing-boats and passenger smapands; and the town comprises handsome public buildings and churches, Mohammedan mosques, Hindoo temples, Chinese joss-houses, good European houses, massive warehouses, queer of old Kling and Chinese bazaars, and long suburbs of Chinese and Malay cottages.""

For the British, the empire is now forever lost, but the lesson still stands. A successful hegemon must provide a *""platform""* which enables the self-enrichment of its partners. In IR parlance, it must provide ""global common goods."" America has been able to provide them for 5 decades after 1945. Would/Can America provide them also in the future? I think this is an important question.",geopolitics,Russia

It goes something like 

>Saudi Arabia is intentionally leaving the oil taps on as a strategy to kill North American shale!  Flood the market with cheap oil, drive out those companies by bankrupting them, then go back to the glorious days of high oil prices!

Sometimes you'll see this repeated with Iran as the primary target, because the Saudis and Iranians have very high tension right now.  Unfortunately, this analysis is mostly false.  It's not 100% wrong - I'm sure the Saudis will be happy if Iran gets hurt, or if North American shale companies go bankrupt.  But it's simply not the primary reason why they are pumping.

---------------------

What is the reason Saudi Arabia is still pumping?  Because they can't drive the price down by themselves - they're only 13% of world oil production.  If they were to cut production, the price of oil would rise...  but not that much. If the price increases by 10-15% but your volume plunges, you just lost a huge amount of money.  It makes zero financial sense to cut production by yourself - you do nothing but lose money.

But what about OPEC?  If OPEC were to slash production as a group, would that make a difference?  Potentially.  OPEC controls about 40% of the world's production.  This is less than their heyday (more than 50%) but it's still a huge chunk.  The problem is that OPEC doesn't work - a cartel only functions if the members trust each other not to cheat.  If a cartel has cheaters who continue to pump high volume after agreeing to a production cut, the cartel falls apart.  And Saudi Arabia absolutely does not trust the rest of OPEC.

To see why, you have to glance backwards a few decades.  In the 1980s the price of oil had slipped heavily, and the Saudis held meetings to push it back up.  The Saudis believed that they had OPEC's agreement to limit production, and started to slash their own production.  The rest of OPEC didn't stick to it, and continued to pump.  The Saudis went forward, undeterred.  The cut their own production to a quarter of previous levels... and not much happened.  The rest of OPEC didn't cut, and prices didn't rise by that much (*certainly* not enough to make up for a 75% fall in volume).  Saudi Arabia lost a boatload of money, and got pissed.  They turned the oil tap back on and flooded the market, and prices dropped like a brick.  That moment essentially sealed the end of OPEC.

Since then OPEC has barely functioned.  Leading up to the 91 Gulf War, Saddam wanted a production cut to help himself and all members.  But the Saudis didn't trust him (or anyone), Iran hated him, and nothing happened.  In the mid-90s oil fell to *fifteen dollars a barrel* before the cartel got its head out of its butt and was able to agree to mild production cuts in 1998.

Even these cuts were unlikely to work for long, or to drive the price of oil very high, but geopolitical factors saved OPEC for a while.  In the early 2000's three things happened

* 9/11
* Two middle eastern wars
* Demand from China and India skyrocketed

Without having to have any production cuts at all, the price of oil went through the roof, shattering OPEC's own lofty late-90s goal for what the price should be.  It was basically nirvana for oil producing countries.  But the deep divisions and mistrust remained.  In 2008 the price began to crash as the global recession hit.  OPEC held meetings and tried to agree to production cuts to keep prices high.  What happened?

>On 10 September 2008, one such production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of OPEC negotiating session where the organization voted to reduce production. Although Saudi Arabian OPEC delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. The New York Times quoted one such anonymous OPEC delegate as saying ""Saudi Arabia will meet the market’s demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed.""[58]

This is the new reality of OPEC - agreement to cut, followed by backstabbing.  This quote is from 2008, before North American shale was really a huge concern in the market.  But the Saudis see (out of pure, financial self interest) the best thing as 'pump baby pump'.  They don't trust the rest of OPEC - particularly not the basket cases like Venezuela who are almost certain to cheat.  There might be some trust among the Arab gulf states, but not among membership at large - too many poorly run governments and untrustworthy strongmen.  Remember, this is before shale was on anybody's mind as a major problem.

So we reach the current day - prices have dropped because of slowing demand in China, and increased shale production in North America (just to list a few primary reasons).  There are a lot of countries desperate to cut production.  But the Saudis have publicly proclaimed that ""We don't care if prices crash to 20 dollars a barrel"".  That number isn't an accident - *that matches history* - the last time OPEC actually cut was in 1998 when prices hit 15 dollars a barrel.  $15 in 1998 is roughly $21.80 in 2015. Things have to get incredibly, incredibly bad for OPEC to actually band together.  And 20 dollars a barrel is where the Saudis probably stop making money - their production costs are estimated somewhere between 10-20 dollars a barrel ([estimates](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/news/oil-prices-production-costs/) [vary](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/07/22/u-s-winning-oil-war-against-saudi-arabia/)).  The simple truth is that Saudi Arabia can make plenty of money right now because their production costs are so low, and they don't want to lose volume or market share.  They don't trust OPEC to keep with a cut because of their historical experience and the bad governance in many of their partners.  So they keep pumping because there's nothing else to do.

As I stated in the beginning, I'm sure they are happy about some of the side-effects of this strategy.  The Saudis would love to hurt shale producers, even if it would only be a temporary hit to them.  They're definitely happy Iran is feeling the hurt of low oil prices, because Saudi Arabia is basically in a proxy war (or two) with Iran.  The Saudis are also more than happy to hurt Russia, who is financing Assad (whom they oppose).  This is all true, but it's mostly secondary side-effects.  The primary reason for low oil prices today is the 1980's era OPEC cheating - The Saudis have played this game before and gotten burned.  Until things reach their breakeven point of about 15-20 dollars per barrel, Saudi Arabia isn't budging.

As an aside, the entire 'drive shale out of business' model wouldn't really make a lot of sense anyways.  Shale is a flexible (well, flexible for O&G) type of production that can start/stop fairly quickly.  If the price goes back up, shale production revs back up and the price drops again after just a short interlude.  The big American O&G companies are also advancing technology in this area incredibly fast, and the cost to produce is dropping.  Even bankruptcy wouldn't really be a problem - even if all the shale companies went under, the US and Canada are financially advanced.  Some company or financier would always be there to buy up the bankrupted assets and quickly revive the dead company in the event of high prices.

73,Is Europe today resembling Germany in the nineteenth century before unification? What do you think the geopolitical potential of a unified Europe would be?,641.0,o1olyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/o1olyf/is_europe_today_resembling_germany_in_the/,373.0,1623904716.0,"It does resemble Germany from the later nineteenth century in many crucial ways, particularly in being a place where a sort of ""pan-ethnic"" identity has long existed alongside massive political fragmentation.

# The present situation

Today the European Union stands as a sort of entity that is more than just a economic bloc but less than a full political federation, like the post-Napoleonic German confederation. There are of course differences that include still entrenched specific national identities, [economic differences](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gs4eo4/if_the_eu_splits_then_will_it_be_a_northern/) between the different regions, outside influence trying to keep the region divided and such. But there are also massive advantages, first of which is of course the fact that the [dominant Western establishment elite wants federalization](https://www.ft.com/content/3d0cc856-e187-11e6-9645-c9357a75844a) in order to allow the EU to become a true global political giant in its own right that would be on the same level as the US and China.

Today we are also seeing the rise of genuinely pan-European forms of nationalism being on the ascent. Primarily of two kinds, one is the more [liberal variety](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/02/huntingtons-disease-and-the-clash-of-civilisation-states) pushed relentlessly by the establishment and latter is the [ethnic variety](https://www.politico.eu/article/who-are-europe-far-right-identitarians-austria-generation-identity-martin-sellner/) seen in the various identitarian groups. And although they differ in many ways and the former is pushed by those in power while the latter is from groups aspiring to power, they converge on the same final goal of European unity. If the establishment form of pan-European liberal nationalism continues to fail to garner mass support to push for federalization, it is not at all unlikely that parts of establishment will defect and try to use pan-European ethnic nationalism as an ideological justification to rally the masses for unification. This scenario is all the more likely keeping in mind the [rapid pace at which Western European politics has been moving right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51721356) since the 2015 migrant crisis. One thing however to keep in mind is that both forms of these pan-European nationalisms are primarily found in the West, so the reactions and developments in the East would be interesting to see to say the least.

This all comes in the backdrop of a decline of individual European states on the world stage. France or Germany or Italy today are dwarved massively by the US or the rising China, creating geopolitical pressures that has helped lead them closer into a union.

# Potential unification scenarios and similarities to German unification

As mentioned above, despite massive integration between the elites of the different European countries there continues to exist an economic split between the North and the South and a more political split between the West and the East. These can potentially make the union very vulnerable and prone to collapse, especially keeping in mind potential outside interference to stop any federalization. The scenario where the US tries to exploit West-East fissures to get countries like Poland to torpedo a full federalization is not at all unlikely. Especially keeping in mind that a united Europe would be a power in its own right separate from the US, reducing the global influence of the latter by a large amount. This is something the American leadership certainly is not going to simply accept as the current arrangement where a loosely united Europe is dominated by it is the ideal scenario for Washington DC.

Keeping the above points in mind, a scenario I find particularly likely is that at the beginning there would be a federalization of old ""Frankish Europe"" as in the territories of the former Carolingian empire. This is especially likely if the Brussels establishment becomes desperate with time but the North-South and West-East divisions turn out to not be bridgeable for the time being. This ""core"" Europe, that should consist of Germany, the low countries, France and potentially Scandinavia than can play the role of Prussia, essentially expanding Southward and Eastward with time. The German unification that happened in the nineteenth century was an event of Prussian expansionism, where Prussia pushed out Austria and then proceeded to take in smaller northern and southern German states under its aegis and justified doing so through the ideological banner of German nationalism. A similar thing can happen here although admittedly future scenarios are not fully predictable.

One very important thing that can see the whole of Southern Mediterranean Euterpe be willing to be absorbed by any ""lesser"" federal EU, especially if the issue of a fiscal union with the North is resolved and France is indeed in, would be the matter of [sub Saharan climate migration](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/08/26/the-coming-migration-out-of-sub-saharan-africa/). The South would be directly threatened by this and would likely become desperate for Northern help in holding off the tide.

# The geopolitical potential of a federal EU

Any federal EU would be demographically robust, either equal to or ahead of the US and only behind a China that has entered demographic stagnation like itself and an economically backwater India. It also has robust military assets including nuclear arms in France and massive potential for a buildup.

It is hard to argue that any potential European federal state, especially if the whole of the union is unified would be anything short of a superpower. It would also under the ideological banner of pan-European nationalism have the potential to eventually absorb countries like Norway and Serbia. In a potential scenario after Putin where the Russian regime and the ruling elite becomes more amenable to Western Europe, there would remain the potential that Russia may also be absorbed which would almost certainly see Europe becoming more powerful than the US or China. A ""Dublin to Vladivostok"" state, unlikely as it is today, is still not entirely improbable and has the potential to be the premier world power. This sort of room to easily expand is something neither the US nor China has.

We should also remember climate change would be aiding Europe geopolitically, primarily by massively damaging countries to the South while boosting the profile of those in places like Northern Euterpe. It is not [just Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/16/magazine/russia-climate-migration-crisis.html) that is set to be a beneficiary of climate change.

In terms of spheres of influence, North Africa or the Maghreb is almost certain to fall under the influence of any European federal state. Sub Saharan climate migration [will existentially threaten the countries here](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gldhce/comment/fqxg8hk) as I hand written here before and thus them likely turning to aid from North of the Mediterranean to hold back the migration is likely.",geopolitics,Russia

Russia has been claiming NATO is an offensive military against Russia and that Russia must buy these advanced weapons now.

But is this really? First off, Russia even with the fall of the Soviet Union, is a nuclear weapons state with thousands of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. Even a limited American incursion such as seizing Kalinigrad or Crimea could be met with hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons on NATO forces. Sure America has the more advanced weapons and may ""win"" as in come out on top in a non-city nuclear exchange, but why would America risk it? Historically, empires expand when they are desperate. The Romans needed loot and land to make up for farmland plundered by Hannibal, the British needed carve up the world as a a sea-power to compete with larger European land economic powers. The Nazis needed to expand into the Soviet Union for security, living space, oil and food. But the United States has no reason to attack Russia, it has the food, tech, oil, security, minerals, it won't risk even a conventional war against a foe like North Korea and Iran unless they were attacked first. Even in a conventional fight, where Russia held off nukes, Russia could tens of thousands of American troops, a war started by the US simply isn't worth it.

So why is this concern really? Historically, Russia has had a bad history of liberalization under the Yeltsin administration, where individuals were corrupt and the nation was starving. In comes Putin, coming up with reforms of controlling the Oligarchs and winning a victory in Chechyna against Islamic sepratists. Putin and George Bush got along at first, but concerns of American withdraw of ABM Treaty along with the US invasion of Middle Eastern states, gave Russia the feeling that US was pushing around its weight and reinforcing a cultural hegemony that could decide world affairs and break apart Russian economic partners. Combined with the Orange Revolution and the Euromaiden, Putin fears that these liberal revolts will spark one in Russia where the Putin regime would be overthrown.

So why the hate for NATO? Well NATO has had a history of increasingly expanding. Poland is known to be one of the members that angered Russia. Poland's economy saw rapid rise, and they could keep their military spending effective for they buy arms for the United States(cheaper). That means more money can be invested in the economy. This could happen to other Eastern European states as well such as Ukraine and Greece increasingly buying Western arms. Combined with the volumes of investment along with sanctions, Russia fears that the Eastern states will spread propaganda of ""the West is so much better than Nationalism, look at all this cool stuff I bought"", which could lead to a ""colored revolution of Russia"" which will lead to the deposition of the Putin regime.

Under this line of thinking, Russia ""won"" because (1) it showed how weak Ukraine was, (2) Russia was able to annex Crimea (the ""Taiwan of Russia"" since it was gifted to Ukraine by ~~Stalin~~ \[EDIT: Krushchev\] in 1954), and (3) it turned Ukraine into a frozen conflict with the Donbass, making it extremely unlikely it would ever be able to join the European Union or NATO.

But is this the correct take? It seems to me like Ukraine was a massive success for the West for a few reasons:

(1) Ukraine pre-Euromaidan was a 50-50 battleground between pro-West and pro-Russia. Russia's reaction, therefore, to annex Crimea and to sever the Donbass was short-sighted because (a) they took the most pro-Russia slices out of Ukraine (equivalent to the GOP losing Florida or Texas in the electoral college) and (b) they shifted a lot of soft pro-Russia support in the East of Ukraine against Russia.

The current geopolitical reality is that Yanukovich is likely the most pro-Russian leader that Ukraine will have for some time.

In a sense, Russia annexing Crimea was a pyrrhic victory, since it's hard for the pro-Russian coalition in Ukraine to take power having lost their base regions. The demographics aren't there any more.

(2) As a result of #1, Ukraine is now firmly Western-oriented. The long-running tug of war that long defined Ukraine between pro-Russia/pro-West has been replaced by a Kyiv Consensus, if you will.

Ukrainian politics now revolves around how pro-Western should the country be. The last election between Poroshenko and Zelensky highlights this new paradigm, with Western Ukraine (centered on Lviv) heavily and messianically anti-Russia (as always) and the Eastern parts (east of the Dnieper) now also anti-Russia, but of a more pragmatic flavor. Yuriy Boyko (the 2019 leader of the pro-Russia camp) was only able to secure wins in the rump Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts still under Ukrainian control, and only secured 12% of the vote, no longer enough to make it to the second round as the pro-Russia camp could previously do.

The end result of all this is simple: the Government in Kyiv is now anti-Russian. People focus on the 10% of Ukraine that the West ""lost"" but don't realize the 90% of Ukraine that the West ""won.""

If you told Western diplomats a decado ago whether they'd trade Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to the Russian sphere for a strongly pro-Western political class governing everywhere else, it'd be considered the bargain of the century.

Ukraine was essentially carved in 2014 with Russia getting 5 million and the West getting 38 million. That's a massive imbalance.

(3) As a result of #2, the West no longer has to play footsie with Kyiv, worrying that they cannot enter into meaningful integration because Ukraine might swing pro-Russia at the next election. Since 2014, cooperation between the West and Ukraine has massively increased, not just in terms of military aid, but political reform technical assistance, economic links, and booming trade ties. Some businessmen in the West are now eyeing Ukraine as the new frontier, as Poland and Romania's economic prosperity has made them more expensive bases for low-value manufacturing.

I could easily see Ukraine now becoming a foundry and a breadbasket for Europe. The end effect of course being that a Ukraine that is more enmeshed in the Western alliance is now more valuable given its value as part of the EU's supply chain. And a feedback loop is taking place. A parallel would be Taiwan, which long sought to become a supply chain link with the West that would enhance its military security by making it indispensable as part of the Western supply chain (see how much TSMC and semiconductors now factors into Washington's calculus about ""losing"" Taiwan).

This at least is my thinking about Ukraine and why the West won a resounding victory. Happy to hear other takes, however, and people's thoughts on why Russia was actually the ""winner"" in the conflict, which seem very prominent across Reddit.",geopolitics,Russia

Geopolitics, in its essence, is a machine. A complex mechanism of moving cogs, manifesting itself in the form of trade deals, territorial expansion, populism and technology. A system so thoroughly complex it’s only rival might be that of the human brain. 
 
Like it or not, the geopolitical players of the 21st century have been set, the cogs have been moved into place and the machine is running efficiently, oiled by newfound armed conflict and populist movements across the world. Now the goals of the most stable individual parts have been shifted from maintenance of their own self interest to hindering the development of their rivals. Akin to containing a virus at its source, before becoming unable to do so.
 
A geopolitical struggle has been brewing right under the nose of the international system, one so insatiably ripe for exploitation it’s truly a miracle it has not been discussed further in international forums. 
 
What might this brand new frontier of geopolitical expansion be? The Arctic.
 
Saying the quiet part out loud is deeply unpopular, however the simple fact of the matter is that it is in the short term interest of some nations to prevent a slowdown of climate change. Some prime examples of this would be that of Russia, Canada, and Denmark.
 
A balance must be struck, masterfully at that. Nations that have everything to gain from the habitability of the Arctic, also have everything to lose by letting these facts be known. 
 
The warming of the earth’s atmosphere, at any rate, is an inevitability by this point, the real debate lies in how much it warms, if direct immediate action is taken in preventing further burning of fossil fuels and accelerating research on carbon capture technology, then it is estimated by the United Nations a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius can be achieved from pre-industrial levels. 
Year after year with shocking consistency, the polar ice caps become more and more vulnerable, with ice shelves previously thought to be unaffected from record warmths collapsing right under this very assumption. While this is undoubtedly a net loss for the preservation of the earth's environment, there are some willing to find opportunities where once it seemed scarce. 
 
The Arctic region is one filled to the brim with rare earth minerals, some examples being Praseodymium, Terbium, Dysprosium, and Neodymium. Along with an abundance of considerably more common yet invaluable natural resources like Coal, Zinc, Iron Ore, Lead, Nickel, Diamonds, and even Sand suitable for construction. 
 
It is safe to assume for any administration willing to attempt exploitation that any measures to extract these resources on a grand scale will be deeply unpopular. Massive protests would likely ensue and the native population of the area might attempt more aggressive means of protest, or possibly even become blatant saboteurs of the project. This has been seen by different projects in Canada, The United States, Finland, Norway, and even Russia.
 
Yet those who are disproportionately unaffected by the public outcry might be more suitable to achieve this future of mineral wealth and living space. The most notable example being Russia, who is uniquely suited to take advantage of this situation, given its chokehold on information through state media and historic willingness to commit atrocities to reach goals (though this is not always without repercussions by the international community). 
 
Of course, looking at any one country’s ambitions must be viewed through the lens of the country’s history, domestic politics, international goals, and the importance of culture and nationalism in their decision making process. Sometimes the most logical decisions simply aren’t the ones taken, as it might be under the jurisdiction of one man longing for former national glory, or delusions of grandeur. So what might be geopolitically advantageous for Russia might not be as Geopolitically advantageous for Sweden, who is surrounded by the economic might of the European Union, which has taken a decidedly aggressive anti-climate change policy.
 
Is it worth it to keep shooting for ambitions if every other shot ricochets? If your country doesn’t have the political will to endure the pushback, the answer is no. 

Yet for hundreds of years the use of the Arctic has been understated and undervalued, the quintessential example of this would be, of course, the acquisition of Alaska. “Seward's Folly” as it would be called domestically, named for the man who advocated for its purchase William Seward. It was seen as unnecessary, a frozen hellscape filled with Inuit and polar bears. But in 1898, 33 years after the purchase, gold was discovered and there began yet another great American gold rush. And would become one of the greatest investments into a nation ever made.

How does this translate into modern day geopolitics? Well, there is an argument to be had that nations who simply play it safe because of domestic pressure might end up on the wrong side of history by passing on a once in a thousand years investment. 

There are no right answers, the truth is the rush for the Arctic hasn’t truly begun, we as a species are in the preparation stages, only the truly foresighted governments and intellectuals have understood the genuine monumentality this will have on the global political system. 

In theory, melted ice caps could make way for practical usage of the famed Northwest Passage, which has put the United States and Canada at odds in the past 10 years. Canada believes that because of it being within the maritime borders of Canada it rightfully belongs to them, while the United States argues it is an international trade route, and should be given such treatment. Regardless of who is right, the fact is this will put the Canadian and US governments at odds, and will drive a political wedge between two countries with a growing nationalist sector.

This alone already has a huge impact, a country with a population smaller than California potentially having such influence over the United States is fundamentally against its doctrine. 

The newfound usage of previously uninhabited lands could bring about truly gargantuan cultural and social changes. While the ice caps melt to bring about reasonable temperatures closer to the poles, nations closer to the equator and with low sea levels will have to rely on nations like Russia and Canada to absorb a massive influx of migrants. 

This, in theory, could bring about a resurgence of nativist ideology in nations that will have to take in the migrants and further ingrain nationalism into its culture and society. 

If this happens, there will likely also be an increase in global armed conflict, nations struggling to survive closest to where the water disappears will be presented with a choice, acquire resources or die. Most nations will choose the former. Extremes in ideology will become far more common than in the modern geopolitical system, as more and more desperate measures will have to be taken to ensure stability, and could provide ample opportunity for “strongmen” with big promises and sharp tongues to achieve power, a far better option over the former “bureaucratic systems.”

This brings about an obvious existential threat to the existing liberal world order, and this realization in many powerful public officials has put the fear of god in them. Which is likely the reason for the very sudden shift in policy on climate change. While a few stand to gain in the short term, everyone loses in the long term. 

Unfortunately, some cannot afford the luxury of thinking about geopolitics in the long term. Plagued by the shadow of their next election campaign, or a gun pointed at their head if they don’t appease those keeping them in power. 

The intelligent thing to do is to play both sides, strike that balance, understand the detrimental consequences of playing too far to one side of the hypothetical, even though it’s too costly to maintain the status queue. 

In the coming years, nations will be presented with a choice, everyone will be forced to choose a side, no matter how much they try to delay. You may try to hide your head in the sand, but the tide will always be there to wash it away.”",geopolitics,Russia

""The received wisdom is that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has breathed new life, and a new sense of purpose, urgency and unity into nato. Someone forgot to tell Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Over the past month the Turkish president has blocked nato enlargement, warned of a new offensive against American-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria and stoked tensions with Greece, also a member of the alliance. A few pundits, in the West but also in Turkey, are once again debating whether nato and Turkey should part ways. This time, they are not alone. “Leaving nato should be put on the agenda as an alternative,” Devlet Bahceli, leader of a nationalist party in Mr Erdogan’s coalition, recently said. “We did not exist because of nato and we will not perish without nato.”

Frustration is also mounting in Western capitals, and in Kyiv, over Turkey’s willingness to accommodate Russia. Many in those places had hoped that the war in Ukraine would force Mr Erdogan to reconsider his romance with Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Opportunism has prevailed instead. Turkey has sold armed drones to Ukraine and closed access to the Black Sea for Russian warships, but it opposes Western sanctions against Russia and openly courts Russian capital. According to a report in the Turkish media, dozens of Russian companies, including Gazprom, are planning to move their European headquarters to Turkey.

Aside from a few words of condemnation at the start of the war in Ukraine, Turkey has remained on good terms with Russia throughout. When Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, visited Ankara this month his Turkish counterpart kindly suggested that the West should ease sanctions against Russia if Russia relaxed its blockade of Ukrainian ports. When Mr Lavrov repeated his claim that Russia had invaded Ukraine to liberate it from neo-Nazis, his host said nothing.

Mr Erdogan’s move to block Sweden’s and Finland’s accession to nato has further damaged Turkey’s standing in the alliance. The strongman has signalled that he wants the Nordic countries to extradite several members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (pkk), an outlawed armed group, and to drop a partial arms embargo against his country. He may also be shopping for concessions from America in exchange for withdrawing his veto, or from Russia for doing the opposite. Mr Erdogan occasionally sounds hostile to nato enlargement as a matter of principle. In a recent guest column for *The Economist*, he went as far as to blame Finland and Sweden for adding an “unnecessary item” to nato’s agenda by asking to join the alliance.

Mr Erdogan may have reasoned that a couple of foreign crises were needed to distract Turkish voters from their fast-diminishing circumstances, as galloping inflation, officially measured at over 70%, devours their savings and wages. In late May he warned of a new military offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria. Forced to shelve such plans, presumably because of opposition from Russia or America or both, he has since lashed out against Greece, demanding that it demilitarise Greek islands hugging Turkey’s western coast. He has also suggested that American bases in Greece pose a threat to Turkey (which hosts American forces itself). This might be bluster, and blow over. But obstructing Finland’s and Sweden’s nato membership while war rages in Europe is bound to have consequences, even if Mr Erdogan backs down. Sweden had been one of the few countries keeping alive Turkey’s hopes of membership in the European Union. That support has now gone.

That may seem a price worth paying to Mr Erdogan if the row fires up his nationalist base. Mainstream Turkish politicians, as well as many humbler Turks, see the pkk purely as a security threat, and have long criticised the West for not taking their concerns about the group seriously. They have bristled especially at America’s decision to team up with the group’s Syrian wing to bring down Islamic State’s caliphate. Westerners, meanwhile, tend to believe that Turkey bears much of the blame for the pkk’s emergence by refusing to grant the country’s Kurds the rights they demand. They have also concluded that Mr Erdogan cannot be trusted to decide who is or is not a terrorist. By applying the label to thousands of people, including bureaucrats, academics, peaceful protesters and Kurdish politicians, and often throwing them into the same prisons as armed militants, Mr Erdogan has cheapened the term as badly as he has Turkey’s currency.

Turkey and the West will never see eye to eye on the issue, and Mr Erdogan’s antics, as well as his habit of suggesting that the West, and not Russia, is the biggest threat to his country, will only make matters worse. Already, 65% of Turks say they do not trust nato, according to a recent survey, although 60% support membership of the alliance.

## Never say never

None of this spells doom for the relationship between Turkey and nato. Western countries will try to work round Turkey’s veto by providing Finland and Sweden with security guarantees. This may leave Turkey sidelined within the alliance. But its departure or eviction from nato is still fantasy. Turkey is on the front line of the war in Syria and close to other conflicts in the Middle East; it controls access to the Black Sea, which has been central to all of Russia’s recent wars; and it serves as a corridor for trade between Central Asia and Europe, especially in energy, notes Ben Hodges, a former commander of American forces in Europe. “I don’t even want to think of nato without Turkey,” he says.

Especially in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Turkey also has no interest in surrendering the power of deterrence that nato membership offers. “I don’t believe it will ever happen,” says Tacan Ildem, Turkey’s former permanent representative to nato. There is no credible alternative, he says. Turkey will probably remain a headache for the alliance, even when Mr Erdogan is out of the picture. But it is a headache nato will have to live with.""",geopolitics,Russia

**The US is orchestrating a far-reaching campaign against China.**

[Full video: Vice President Pence's Remarks on US Policy Towards China](https://youtu.be/aeVrMniBjSc?t=736)

Did Cold War II break out last week while no one was watching? As the Kavanaugh confirmation battle raged, many Americans missed what looks like the biggest shift in U.S.-China relations since Henry Kissinger’s 1971 visit to Beijing.

The Trump administration’s China policy swam into view, and it’s a humdinger. Vice President Mike Pence gave a guide to the approach in a speech last week at the Hudson Institute (where I am a fellow). Denouncing what he called China’s “whole of government” approach to its rivalry with the U.S., Mr. Pence vowed the Trump administration will respond in kind. He denounced China’s suppression of the Tibetans and Uighurs, its “Made in China 2025” plan for tech dominance, and its “debt diplomacy” through the Belt and Road initiative. The speech sounded like something Ronald Reagan could have delivered against the Soviet Union: Mr. Xi, tear down this wall! Mr. Pence also detailed an integrated, cross-government strategy to counter what the administration considers Chinese military, economic, political and ideological aggression.

In the same week as the vice president’s speech, Navy plans for greatly intensified patrols in and around Chinese-claimed waters in the South China Sea were leaked to the press. Moreover, the recently-entered trilateral U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was revealed to have a clause discouraging trade agreements between member countries and China. The administration indicated it would seek similar clauses in other trade agreements. Also last week, Congress approved the Build Act, a $60 billion development-financing program designed to counter China’s Belt and Road strategy in Africa and Asia. Finally, the White House issued a report highlighting the danger that foreign-based supply chains pose to U.S. military capabilities in the event they are cut off during a conflict.
Any one of these steps would have rated banner headlines in normal times; in the Age of Trump, all of them together barely registered. But this is a major shift in American foreign policy. As China responds, and as other countries formulate their approaches to the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, a new international reality will take shape. With many longtime U.S. allies opposed to the Trump administration on trade policy and other matters, and with Russia, North Korea and Iran all looking to frustrate U.S. goals, an indignant China looking for opportunities to make Washington pay may find help.

American businesses engaged directly or indirectly with China could face difficulties as the U.S. strategy is implemented. American presidents have broad authority over trade and investment related to national security. Donald Trump has already used this to threaten and impose tariffs and Mr. Pence warned that even higher tariffs are on the way. The White House report highlighting supply-chain vulnerabilities could provide the basis for new and more far-reaching restrictions.
Business and investors may still be underestimating both the Trump administration’s determination to challenge China and the amount of economic disruption that greater U.S.-China tension can bring. To the mix of longtime China hawks and trade hawks now driving U.S. policy, national security matters more than economic friction, and many of the protestations from the U.S. business community may fall on deaf ears. Both China and the U.S. are likely to move quickly, unpredictably and disruptively as they struggle for advantage; Wall Street should brace itself for further shocks.
In terms of domestic politics, the new and more confrontational policy is likely to be broadly popular. Mr. Trump’s populist base resents the “theft” of American jobs, and human-rights and religious-freedom advocates are increasingly troubled by China’s severe repression at home and support for authoritarian regimes abroad. The foreign-policy establishment may oppose Mr. Trump’s tactics, but it generally accepts the need for a stronger stance against China. Businesses will be split; while some are heavily exposed to a potential deterioration in U.S.-China relations, others are angry about stolen intellectual property, resent restrictions on their access to Chinese markets, or fear competition from subsidized Chinese firms.

Democrats who have relished attacking Mr. Trump for allegedly being soft on Vladimir Putin will have a hard time explaining why a hard line on Russia is a patriotic duty but a tough China policy is a mistake. Things could change if the economic and political costs of confrontation rise, but at least initially the new China policy has encountered little opposition.

Replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, reshaping the Supreme Court, and launching a new Cold War in the same week is quite the trifecta. America may or may not be on the road to greatness under Mr. Trump, but it is certainly going somewhere, and at an accelerating pace.

After a decade of rising tensions by the leader (Milorad Dodik) of the Serb entity Republika Srpska, the culmination came this summer with the election of a new High Representative Christian Schmidt (possible higher engagement of European Union and West in Bosnia), imposing a law banning denials of war crimes in the Bosnian war 92-95 ([Serbs deny Srebrenica genocide](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/23/bosnias-peace-envoy-imposes-jail-terms-for-genocide-denial)) by former High Representative Valentin Inzko, the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina granting ownership of land and forests directly to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina  (not to its entities) and stronger US involvement with new sanctions against corruption ([Dodik to US envoy Escobar: F\*\*k the sanctions)](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/dodik-to-us-envoy-escobar-fk-the-sanctions/).  


An escalation came a few days ago when [Dodik announced RS withdrawal from BiH army, police, intelligence service, tax and judiciary system](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/dodik-announced-rs-entity-withdrawal-from-bih-army-tax-admin-and-judiciary/). In the complex BiH government structure, these decisions should be made in the state parliament (where Dodik does not have a majority). Instead, the decision will be made by the entity national assembly [in a few days](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/speaker-rs-parliament-could-adopt-dodiks-announcements-by-the-end-of-october/), causing a new de facto situation on the ground where state forces will be ordered to leave the RS entity territory.   


It is to be expected that Bosnian forces will not leave RS voluntarily. It is also to be expected that the majority of Serb members of the state army and police will side with Dodik. In such a situation, a conflict between the pro-Bosnian state army and police forces and Serb members of the army and police or a conflict between the RS special police forces (there are state and entity police working in parallel in BiH) and army members is inevitable. After the outbreak of the conflict, Serb barricades on the entity lines were to be expected (the situation of Serb barricades seen at the beginning of the war in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s). If those incidents happen in a few weeks / months, you should know that the new war in Europe started. We can say with 99% certainty that a decision on the expulsion of state forces from the RS entity will be made. The question is whether the ultimatum to leave the territory will be a few days / weeks (war) or half a year - a year (negotiations).  


The military-geopolitical situation on the ground is such that only a contingent of 600 EUFOR soldiers whose mandate expires in November is currently operating in BiH. An extension of the mandate requires a decision in the UN Security Council. Russia's decision to veto could show how serious the current situation is. Russia's veto ([announced this summer](https://www.sarajevotimes.com/moscow-could-respond-by-blocking-the-continuation-of-eufor-mission-in-bih/)) would leave only the Bosnian and Serb forces on the ground in Bosnia, which would practically mean the realization of the above scenario.   
There are currently no statements by Western officials in Bosnia about military intervention due to the deteriorating political situation ([""Just calls to engage from some Western NGOs""](https://twitter.com/DPC_global/status/1448617211325734913?s=20), although Annex 1 of the Dayton Peace Agreement (which is still in force) allows NATO to intervene freely due to breach of the agreement ([""It is understood and agreed that NATO may establish such a force, which will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council (“NAC”) through the NATO chain of command.""](http://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/annex-1a/)). In response to this, it was announced that Russia would enter the conflict due to the activation of NATO forces ([""If that is necessary, we will defend ourselves with our own forces. If it happens that they say NATO will intervene, we will ask our friends – who told us clear and loud they never abandon their friends – to help us,""](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/dodik-republika-srpska-would-ask-friends-to-help-in-case-of-nato-intervention/)).  


The secession of RS is not expected to receive recognition from the EU and the US, which is likely to lead to sanctions against RS, which will put RS and Serbia in a difficult economic situation. The biggest winner will be Russia, which will open a new conflict in the EU's backyard.",geopolitics,Russia

The Russian reaction to the Nile water crisis, during the UN Security Council's [discussion](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210707-un-security-council-resolution-sought-over-ethiopian-renaissance-dam/) last Thursday, raised questions about the reasons for the absence of Moscow's support for Cairo.

**Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, announced in the extraordinary session called for by Egypt and Sudan, its support for Ethiopia's position on the Renaissance Dam crisis.**

The speech of the permanent **Russian representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, rejected the threatening messages from Egypt and Sudan. He stressed that his country would not allow any military action against Ethiopia, and that it was concerned about the growing threatening rhetoric in the crisis.**

**READ:** [**Guaranteed impunity, Sisi has increased his violations**](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210713-guaranteed-impunity-sisi-has-increased-his-violations/)

The Russian position comes despite good relations with Cairo since [the coup](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170703-remembering-egypts-bloody-military-coup/) by Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, who visited Moscow repeatedly and awarded its companies giant projects, the most important of which is the [El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210311-el-dabaa-nuclear-plant-as-important-as-aswan-dam-says-russia-ambassador-to-egypt/) built by his counterpart Vladimir Putin, as well as [the Su-35 fighter deal](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200728-egypt-to-receive-russia-fighter-jets-despite-us-warnings/).

**In response to the Russian delegate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told Egyptian TV on Saturday: ""Maybe he will speak to Ethiopia about their threats of filling and protecting the dam from a hypothetical danger.""**

**The Ethiopians responded by praising the Russian position. At the meeting of the two countries' joint military technical committee in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Minister of Defence,** Marta Luigi, confirmed that Moscow supports her country in various international issues and arenas, including the [Renaissance Dam](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140510-ethiopias-renaissance-dam-is-making-waves-in-egypt/) file, and she thanked Putin.

## Interests

In an interview with *Arabi21*, the Director of the International Institute of Political Science and Strategy, Mamdouh Munir, said: ""The Russian position on the Renaissance Dam crisis is old, and they are keener on their relationship with Ethiopia than on their relationship with Egypt.""

**""They are well aware that the American influence on Egypt does not give them enough space to control it, while the great Chinese support for Ethiopia and the Chinese-Russian consensus give greater opportunities for Moscow to strengthen its presence in the Horn of Africa.""**

The Egyptian expert added: ""Moscow is good at playing between the big players, Washington and Beijing, and is trying to find a path between them, often towards China.""

**READ:** [**Since when has the UN Security Council supported Arab issues?**](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210712-since-when-has-the-un-security-council-supported-arab-issues/)

**""Politics is a game of interests and pressure cards, and Cairo does not hold any Russian pressure cards or interests that would be affected by its siding with Ethiopia,"" added Munir.**

Munir expressed his belief that ""Russian anger towards Sudan over [the naval base](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210713-sudan-reviewing-russia-navy-base-deal/) does not have a significant impact because Russia knows very well that its position will not change anything in the equation with the presence of China or Washington. **Therefore it preferred to bet on Ethiopia's winning horse instead of Cairo, which lost its water rights in the Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) agreement.""**

## Historical and political

Writer and political analyst Dr Ashraf Al-Sabbagh says Russia's shift is a result of ""historical, ideological, and political"" reasons.

He noted to *Arabi21:* ""Russia is not the Soviet Union that collapsed in 1991, and for the past 30 years, the Russian Federation has been ruled by extreme right-wing nationalists who developed a new combative, strategic and social doctrine for it, away from the remnant theoretical model of the Soviet Union.""

""Russia, as a major and nuclear country, and a permanent member of the Security Council, has its interests, and it is not ashamed of selling weapons, wheat and wiring, and looking out for its interests.""

""The far-right nationalist leadership in Russia has not forgotten the expulsion of Russian experts in 1972 and Cairo signing the [Camp David accords](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190326-remembering-the-egypt-israel-peace-treaty/) without Moscow,"" added Al-Sabbagh.

""Russia understood that the West is not satisfied with the way Sisi came to power, and this is where the desires of Cairo and Moscow connected. Moscow had stated that it would stand by Cairo against the West on files of democracy, freedoms, human rights and civil society, and that it would support the ruling regime as long as there is hostility between it and the West.""

""The cooperation of the two parties took place on the basis of hostility towards the West, but the Russian side expressed its desire to obtain military bases and facilities and to build infrastructure, railways, roads, and bridges.""

""Moscow wanted to take control of Egypt, even in terms of exporting weapons, fighters and missiles. Russia pushed its media to launch a campaign on rapprochement and strategic relations in order to drive wedges between Egypt and the West, isolate Cairo, and deal with it as Damascus deals with Tehran.""

**READ:** [**UN Security Council backs African Union mediation over Renaissance Dam**](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210710-ethiopia-un-security-council-backs-african-union-mediation-over-renaissance-dam/)

Al-Sabbagh added: ""The volume of economic exchange between them is very weak. They have added the prices of weapons to make it appear to be larger than it is, but Russia only receives a few tonnes of potatoes and vegetables from Egypt that it can get from Turkey, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, and Uzbekistan.""

Regarding the implications of the Russian delegate's speech at the UN, Al-Sabbagh says: ""They hope investments open up to the Russians, and hope to establish military bases there, after Russia failed to establish bases in Egypt, Djibouti and Sudan.

He stresses that ""Moscow has indications of a Western tendency to settle the dam file, and there is a rapprochement between Cairo, Western capitals and Washington, so Russia began to oppose everything and take sides with those against the Western desire.""

""Russian state media is pouring oil on the fire and provoking the Ethiopian public opinion, as the Egyptian statements are highlighted in provocative formulations to portray Egypt's growing threatening discourse.""

He explains that Moscow is trying to maintain relations with Egypt by showing flexibility with useless and non-urgent files, while being tough on important files, and taking malicious positions that include forms of pressure and bargaining.

He also notes that Russia is ""also trying to maintain relations with Ethiopia and give it a Russian media platform, relying on the possibility of gaining any interest from it and using it in its conflicts with the Americans and Europeans.""

""In light of Moscow's attempts to maintain balanced relations with Cairo and Addis Ababa, it has not forgotten to drive wedges between Cairo and Washington, Cairo and Brussels, and seek military facilities that have been rejected more than once. However, Moscow is manoeuvring and insisting through many channels, and exchanging files for others,"" he added.

Al-Sabbagh believes that ""the positions of the Americans and Europeans on the dam crisis are more moderate and logical than Russia and China.""

## Russian base in Sudan

As for the impact of Sudan freezing the agreement to allow the establishment of a Russian military base in the Red Sea after pressure from the US, the expert on Russia said: ""This base was a conspiracy by Russia, which took advantage of the conditions of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and his bad relations with the West.""

He adds, ""As usual, Moscow pushed its media to launch campaigns of confusion, exaggeration and misinformation to drive wedges between Sudan and the West. Al-Bashir was deposed, and Russia did not fulfil its promises to protect him, and therefore Khartoum began to reconsider its relations with all the countries of the world.""

He does not believe there are American or European pressures on Sudan, as these are major interests, and Sudan has the right to decide its fate and stick to the interests of its people.

The year 2020 has been highly successful for Turkey from a geopolitical viewpoint. This article will go into deep on what happened the last year, how the drone might change the conflict in Donbas and what we can expect in an era of new warfare. The article is written by a hobby enthusiast on the subject and should be treated as such.*

*UPDATED; 12 hours after this article was published Ukraine (if the source is to be trusted) confirmed that its Bayraktar is officially used in the frontline.*  

*Yuriy Misyagin, the Deputy Chairman of* [*#Ukraine*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hashtag_click)*’s Defence and Intelligence Committee:  “Bayraktar TB2 Armed UAVs made their first flights over the Donbas area and detected the locations of Pantsir-S1, S-125 and Tor anti-aircraft missile systems.”*

**Background**

February 2020. The Covid virus is just starting to get the attention it demands globally, but the headlines are in Ankara. The Turkish President has just ordered an offensive into Syria or, more specific, operation Spring Shield. \*

Just days before, many Turkish soldiers, from 36-100 depending on the source, lost their lives when the Syrian Air Force and allegedly the Russian Air force conducted airstrikes against Turkish Army positions. The following operation might just have changed warfare forever.

After five days the Russian President Vladimir Putin and Erdogan meet in Moscow, where a ceasefire was signed, but what happened in those five days?

The answer was a massacre. Turkey used for the first time its arsenal of drones that took Russian and Syrian countermeasures barehanded. Video footage showed them destroying one Syrian armoured vehicle after another, including more than 100 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and air defence systems. Reportedly dozens of Turkish ANKA-S and Bayraktar-TB2 drones attacked government targets and destroyed several Russian-made air defence systems. Hundreds of Syrian government soldiers were killed, and Turkey had pushed deep into the Syrian front in only six days; drones were seen as an apparent substitute for manned air-fighters for the first time.

* *The Assad regime suffered heavy losses as a result of the drone campaign: Several hundred soldiers, 151 tanks, eight helicopters, three drones, three fighter jets (including two Russian-made Sukhoi Su-24s), around 100 armoured military vehicles and trucks, eight aerial defence systems, 86 cannons and howitzers, ammunition trucks and dumps, and one headquarters, among other military equipment and facilities. -1*

It also, according to unofficial sources, took out the Russian Pantsir air defence system. This was the gamechanger that might have changed the course of warfare. 2

The events in Syria is not the first time drones has been used, but it was the breakthrough. The U.S had previously used drones, but their range, technological limits and inaccuracies had cost more than it was worth. The infamous Afghani wedding party strike in 2008 killed 37 civilians and a lot of U.S goodwill in the region.

The scenario was now different. The drones had performed their task optimally and hit targets precisely. It might also be the deciding factor in the Azerbaijani offensive later that year. However, the main point was not its effectiveness as a whole, but lack countermeasures that Russia could provide.

**A Ukrainian substitute**

One of the main problems that Ukraine is facing in upgrading its armed forces is the lack of funds and personnel to maintain a modern air force. The Ukrainian air force hasn't acquired a new manned warplane since 1991,\*\* It will cost much more than the current budget to replace or modernize them.

The second problem is that there are very few places, if any, where Russian surface-to-air missiles can not target Ukraine's aircraft while they're taking off. Even the country's Southern areas can not be safe for potential SAMs in the Transanitra region of Moldavia. So while Ukraine has logically bought and modernized their transport planes and helicopters, they have gone a different direction regarding the offensive air arsenal, rather concretely south over the Black Sea.

Since last year Ukraine has received and started operating 9 Bayraktar-TB2 drones for reconnaissance work in the front line. From 27 July 2020 until 7 November 2020, only three Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Donbas' frontlines. The reason could have been a shift of focus to Karabakh's ongoing war and reviewed peace talks. Still, it remains the fact that drones have provided a better overview and intelligence of separatist movements in the last months and, without a doubt, have saved the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.

Although I would be careful to state that Turkish drones' acquirement is the reason for the region's escalation, it will be reasonable to think the jargon and the top modern Russian anti-air system's movement frontline is connected. Political players would take the element of drone warfare into account.

**Turkish-Ukrainian cooperation, a Moscow headache**

Francis Fukuyama has stated that the world may have seen its last massive tank battle during the 2003 Iraq War. \*\*\*\* The success of drone warfare has have done much to promote Turkey's rise as a regional power in the year 2020, and the success of its domestic weapon industry is now seen as the country success story.

A more critical point, especially from Ukraine POW, is that the world has still not seemed to catch up with effective countermeasures against the new generation of drones. While Russia has unique and modern anti-air systems, it is still designed for fighter jets and planes, not drones with a wingspan of 12 meters or less. It can be argued that the Russian weapon industry has in its reach to modernize the formal aspects of military, tanks, planes etc., forgot the new technology of drones and laser.

A more severe concern for an attacking force will be if Ukraine starts with weaponizing its drone programme. In cooperation with the Turkish and Qatari weapon industry, the Ukrainians have started with a programme to introduce a small, lightweight catapult-launched loitering weapon system, dubbed RAM. \~ While it might be difficult to hit one Bayraktar drone, a swarm of RAM drones can be next to impossible. Ukrainian troops theoretically could deploy so many drones and loitering munitions—and add unarmed decoy 'bots to the mix, too—that there would be more targets than Russian missiles. The potential targets are then just limited by the scope of enemy material nearby.

The costs of the rockets might be higher than the price of the RAM drones also. The second countermeasures Russia has is jamming the drones. There is clear evidence they already are doing; just a couple of days ago, something jammed an observation drone by the OSCE. However, unlike non-protected OSCE drones, Ukrainian drones most likely use NATO/Turkish countermeasures that, by all indications, are more advanced.

Moscow might need new and better air defences and jammers. If Ukraine goes all-in on drones, Russia might have to go all-in on defences *against* drones, and that takes time, money and technology that will not be ready for battle within a month or so.

**Not a gamechanger in the concise run**

This article bases its arguments on sources and hypothetical situation based on the information available. The aspects of how ready Ukraine is and what countermeasures Russia have is very unreliable.

However, Turkey has decided and influenced heavily three regional conflicts based on the drone weapon platform and arguably have risen to be a regional power to challenge Saudi-Arabia and Iran. Another fact to consider is that the three losing factions (Syria government, Armenia, Libyan House of Representatives) have all been supported and supplied by the Russian arms industry.

The Armenians deployed foreign drones as well: the Russian Orlan-10 UAV. However, the Orlan-10 could not defeat the Bayraktar TB2 UAV. Turkey effectively concluded one of the 'frozen conflicts' of the former Soviet Union through the simple export of a drone fleet and removed a strong playing card from Russia in the region.

It would be wise of Russia not to underestimate Turkey's threat as it loses grounds on two fronts critical to Ankara's national interest. Turkey is in a prime position to leverage its defence relations with Ukraine against Russia, which it already has started with.

In November, Ukraine and Turkey stated they would form a JV to produce Ukrainian armed versions of the Bayraktar TB2 drones.

The Donbas war is also benefiting Turkey as an excellent spot to test the weaponry in live conflict.

To conclude the Turkish aspect, the country is seemingly rising as a global challenger to the Russian military industry as a 100% self-sufficient country in terms of military production. It has placed thoughtfully doubt in Russian hardware for many potential buyers. The Pantsir missile system was specially placed under suspicion as twitter videos showed them reduced to rubble from drone strikes.  The Pantsir system might be in use in the separatist area of Donbas.

On the other hand, Ukraine might finally have a card in the game to move away from the Minsk agreement that is seen as very skewed towards Russia from the perspective of Kyiv. The perceived new hand might also be a part of a renewed political push from Zelensky to remove pro-Russian influence from the country.

This position is where it can become dangerous for Ukraine. Like Saakashvili in Georgia 2008, Ukraine can think they have a more substantial card than reality display. The sheer machine of the Russian military demands more than just drones and history has been demonstrated that Russia will act if given a dare to do so. It is a different story to fight against Russian supported enemies than to fight Russia itself. Like all neighbourhood countries to Russia, the aim is always to make the nation bleed enough until most Russians say it's not worth it.

If the drone programme of Ukraine is as good as the recent confidence from Kyiv has shown, it can be a bloody conflict. Russia's air superiority will not be guaranteed, but there should be no belief that it alone will stop pure determination from Kremlin.

The most lucid optimistic argument comes from Igor Schatz in [this long twitter threat](https://twitter.com/copernicus2013/status/1495936129358520321?s=21). I have compiled it to readable form here. I am curious if anyone here sees major flaws with his reasoning. His basic is that Putin’s bluff has been called and Putin is now chained to an outcome he did not want. Schatz’s comments in essay form below:

My 2 cents on Putin’s decision today:

This is a strategic defeat for Putin and a full-scale war is even less likely after today then before. Let me explain in this thread. The primary goal of Putin has been to subjugate Ukraine and especially its foreign and defense policy to Russian interests and priorities.

In essence the goal was to make Ukraine into a vassal state, a la Belarus where Russia retains full political control and leverage and which is currently in the process of soft annexation. The primary tool to achieve this goal have been Minsk protocol 2 which were signed in 2015 after a Russian-military-led offensive on Debaltseve, a small town in Donbas but a major railway juncture. 

This agreement achieved a cease fire, a pow exchange and basically stopped the active phase of the conflicts. The protocol aimed at reintegrating the separatist part of Donbas into Ukraine proper but on the conditions drafted by separatists’ Russian handlers. More specifically, Putin’s focus on Minsk 2 was on the part that would require Ukraine to conduct a constitutional reform that would give the separatist region a special status that would allow it to veto any foreign and defense policy decisions. 

Since separatists are just Russian puppets and their leaders are in fact Russian citizens ( the current one is even a member of Putin’s party ), this would essentially give Russian government a direct political control over Ukraine, essentially eliminating its sovereignty for all intents and purposes. Additionally, the protocol envisioned full amnesty to separatists many of which engaged in outright criminal activity and human rights abuses that would be on par with Hamas. It also stipulated that the separatist militants would be renamed and remade into a local police with potential jurisdiction over the whole country, and it also put the region in charge of appointing its own judges and prosecutors, that of course would be drawn from the ranks of militants with the implicit advice and consent form Kremlin. You can imagine the kind of Justice that would be practiced by such judges and courts.. there was 0 chance that Ukraine was going to accede to giving up its sovereignty, as it has had 0 political and civic support for obvious reasons.

The confidence game put on by Putin that involved the massive show of force aimed at compelling Ukraine or compelling the west to force Ukraine to abandon its sovereignty via this backdoor maneuver. Putin’s calculus was that the west is divided and weak, Biden Administration is weak especially since he canceled sanctions on NS2 in may and practically agreed at the Geneva summit in June to do Putin’s bidding on talking Ukraine into Minsk 2. 

Putin also counted on destabilizing Ukraine politically by keeping the threats of force, potentially leading to the fall of government and divided country that would lead to a friendlier regime that he could either control or even potentially install. All of these assumptions of Putin were proven wrong… the west is united, and even Putin’s attempt to send separate letters with same demands/proposals to different countries in a gambit to try and pick some off didn’t work.

Instead he got one response from the EU directly basically telling him “buddy, why you wasting your time and printer paper sending your silly letters around when you can just send one directly to Brussels which is where you gonna get a single response from”. His progressive escalation also didn’t work on rattling Ukrainians.. there was no panic in the country, the political leadership was united and showed amazing resilience and resolve and the army was disciplined not to respond to military provocations. 

Putin kept escalating because inertia took over and because he assumed that credible threats of war (culminating with nuclear drills over the weekend) would scare soft Europeans who don’t want war and who are visiting the Kremlin like never before. At the same time, the US has turned up its own info war which basically meant to say that a) we are not going to honor your ultimatums and b) we have seen your war threats and are ready for war if that’s what you intend. 

The reaction from the Ukrainian government was similar a) your demands to give up our sovereignty are unacceptable; b) we will talk about our aspirations to join NATO louder because its our sovereign right to chose alliances we sign up for and c) we see your troops on our borders and hear your threats but we won’t panic and we are confident in our army that acquired a lot of combat experience since 2014 ( I’ve seen a number of 400,000 of Ukrainians with active combat experience ) and is highly motivated. Meanwhile, the UK, Canada, the US and a number of other NATO countries have been sending plane loads of weapons to Ukraine for weeks, on some days up to a dozen planes - to either help deter Putin or help Ukraine army defend the country more effectively. 

In the end, Putin’s confidence game has failed, since he never planned on the actual war which would be costly in resources and lives and very risky since given Ukraine’s resolve he wouldn’t achieve political aims even by military means, he doesn’t have enough troops to control the country which is the 2nd largest in Europe by territory and has a large population motivated to kill an invading force, and this adventure might even cost him his own regime at home.

The decision to recognize the separatist part of Donbas today is probably the worst outcome for him and the best for Ukraine: it buries Minsk protocols, getting Ukraine off the hook politically and preserves the status quo by freezing the conflict but in a favorable state: full responsibility for the area is shifted to Russia, Russian troops that are already present there would now merely operate actually wearing their uniforms and as such holding Russia more accountable for what happens there while accelerating military and economic aid for Ukraine as well as needed domestic reforms that would speed up the eventual path to the EU.  For Putin, this is a strategic defeat because he lost Minsk protocol as a tool for potential political leverage over Ukraine.

Ukraine is now more united, more anti-Russia and on a faster path of spinning out of Kremlin’s “sphere of influence”. Why did Putin go for this option ? Well, faced with western and Ukraine’s resolve in response to his ultimatums and what he thought were credible threats of force, but unwilling to make good on these threats (high five to the boys at Langley for confronting his bluff in the information space) he also needed to save face and show a win for all his Herculean confidence efforts. The win that he needed for this not so much to show to his domestic audience but to show to his own little circle of strongman that constitute his inner circle… because coming out of this as a loser in their eyes would basically dramatically shorten his reign.

The residual risks right now is that the separatists might want to expand their territorial control since they only control 1/3 of the administrative regions in Donbas and claim domain over the whole admin region. While this is a risk, it doesn’t seem highly likely since it would create a risk of a big war for Putin that he was trying to avoid, since expanding territories controlled by “sovereign republics” doesn’t score anything for Putin politically while risking far harsher sanctions and bad optics of dead civilians that allegedly he wants to protect, etc.. this is probably a good time for him to consolidate and absorb mild sanctions from the west while doing his best to shift attention from this issue for now he is likely to come back with another attempt at Ukraine at another time, but for now he knows he lost badly and its better to get attention away from this quickly to make sure the strongmen around him don’t think too hard and realize the same. 

It’s much better for him to focus on the ongoing soft annexation of Belarus which I predicted a month ago. Russian troops aren’t leaving after the end of planned exercises yesterday, and Belarus is holding a constitutional referendum on the 27th. Part of this constitutional reform calls for allowing Belarus to host nuclear weapons on its territory (guess whose wink-wink), and if you followed Belarus elections in August 2020, you’d know that results of the referendum are preordained. 

So we will likely have permanent Russian military bases and nukes on Belarus territory shortly… look on the map and you’ll see that Belarus is quite close to the center of Europe.. this would be a legitimate win for Putin and I think he’d want to focus the attention of his entourage as well as homegamers watching state tv on a legitimate win and away from Ukraine where he lost.. the small wild card is whether anti-Lukashenko protests that were suppressed in 2020 will will resume if the people realize that their independence and sovereignty at stake in a country where Lukashenko has little support and legitimacy.. mind you, Lukashenko has always been independent-minded on behalf of his country and this is a new development. 

Some final thoughts: why has Putin decided to raise the stakes now.. i think COVID is partially responsible.. during COVID Putin has been isolated and has narrowed his inner circle and the people he sees personally. Just look at him meeting foreign leaders to refuse to submit to the anal-probe Covid test at the opposite end of a 50 foot long table. 

My theory is that he is deadly afraid of COVID partly because he has grown more paranoid, partly because he might be immune compromised based on reports of some severe illness he might have had in 2019 (unconfirmed), and also because he is not vaccinated and he has seen the severe death toll of the unvaxxed in Russia. I am pretty confident that he is not vaccinated because he is too paranoid to allow himself to be injected with anything. 

Because his inner circle likely narrowed to the hard liners, this also means that his sources of information and advice have narrowed and he likely only receives advice and info that he wants to see and/or that his entourage wants him to see. And he probably miscalculated in his assumptions that his confidence van would succeed because they were based on information that wasn’t representative of reality. My theory also explains why his speech today was so unhinged. He came across extremely angry, but mainly because he has lost and he had to resort to the option in his arsenal that he wasn’t really planning on using.

To summarize: Putin played a high confidence game to compel the west to new world order and to compel Ukraine to loss of sovereignty and lost. There won’t be a full-scale war (though limited confrontation in the east Ukraine is still very much on the table). But there also won’t be a big deescalation, though I think we will see some troop drawdown shortly since he can’t keep the troops idle for too long living in tents in the middle of the Russian winter end. 

Basically, if Putin was serious about a full-scale invasion he wouldn’t need the theater of recognizing the separatist “republics” first; he also would have had the state prepare the nation for war through months-long war propaganda - which wasn’t happening … Putin thought he was going around open-carrying in Massachusetts but realized that he is in Texas instead... so he had to resort to grabbing a misplaced wallet and retreating to the nearest bar to get drunk.",geopolitics,Russia
127,Is current China an example of a successful fascist state?,500.0,o9jp9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/o9jp9q/is_current_china_an_example_of_a_successful/,225.0,1624884978.0,"""Fascism"" of course is a popularly abused term, with even academic definitions at times getting to the point of being so vague as to be meaningless. Nevertheless for the definition of ""fascism"" here I will be referring primarily to the works of the late [Zeev Sternhell](https://press.princeton.edu/our-authors/sternhell-zeev) as well as [Roger Griffin](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/templates/pages/staff.aspx?uid=p0054581) alongside an attempt at identifying the common traits that were shared by the ""fascist"" states and political movements in the 1930s and 40s.

The first example is obviously going to have to be Italy, where the model originated alongside Germany serving as the second model. Merely reactionary regimes like Spain under Franco or the Latin American juntas during the cold war are going to be excluded from this.

Now to define the pillars of ""fascism"":

- Some form of state led market economy. Called ""corporatism"" by Mussolini it is generally a system where the market is formally subordinated to the state not just in theory but in practice as well. Heavy interventions, regulations, as well as the subordination of economic interests to that of the state and the political leaders in charge of it.

- A totalitarian state with a surveillance and censorship apparatus that monitors and controls the entire flow of information to the general public.

- Revolutionary nationalism with the narrative of a ""national rebirth"". Dubbed ""Paligenetic ultranationalism"" by Griffin it is usually manifested in militaristic mass movements led by charismatic leaders preaching the glorious rebirth of the nation. Mainly a propaganda narrative but still the ideological heart found across all decidedly ""fascist"" states and movements.


From above, we can see that the concept of the ""total state"", a state that completely dominates the economy (without abolishing the market) and the society at large is one half of the fascist coin. The other half arguably is the revolutionary  nationalism with the narrative of rebirth at the center.

Now China arguably passes the requirement of being a unitary totalitarian state. The state is the ultimate overlord of the economy and society. The CCP has the final say on all matters and actually practices that formal right of its all the time. The state also completely monitors, controls and censors the flow of information in the public sphere.

The one trait then that China is not possessing entirely is the ""paligenetic ultranationalism"" layed out by Griffin. But this in the end is primarily of propaganda value, and China today clearly shows a high level of Han ethnic nationalism. It is manifested in numerous forms such as the currently ongoing attempt at forcefully Sinicizing the Uyghurs to the Chinese leaderships repeated use of the ""century of humiliation"" in propaganda and promises of national rejuvenation to the population.

From the above, I am obviously arguing that the ""Chinese model"" right now is extremely similar to the Italian fascist model. Now to preempt counter arguments about the militarism and imperial ambitions of the axis that China seem to lack, I would argue that these two traits are less ""fascist"" and more a general trait of the international system and of great powers of the time in which the movements of Mussolini and Hitler took power. Germany and Italy as is well known were late comers to the game of colonialism and failed miserably at establishing territorially massive states like Britain, France, the US or Russia (that later became the USSR). That general climate of seeing continental sized territory and resources as necessary to be globally competitive was something that served as the crucial reason that drove Italian and German expansionism.

China today exists in a rather different geopolitical situation with adversaries to whom its relations are different. There is no Chinese equivalent to the red scare and the USSR in the east that served to radicalize the European political right. The United States today is the principal threat to China, and it is not seen as being as existentially threatening as the Bolshevik state was viewed by the German elite. China today is also a territorial and demographic behemoth in a way that Germany and Italy never were when compared to the US, the USSR or the British empire and this surely soothes the mindset of the Chinese elite. Its also flanked on all sides by states that are too powerful to be easy prey (Russia and India) or are going to be likely defended by the US, a decidedly superior military power. It then can be stated that under these circumstances the Chinese ruling elite has decided on gradually building up power and pushing ahead rather than attempt an ""all or nothing"" gamble like Hitler did.",geopolitics,Russia

I have translated and summarized one of the most popular posts on Zhihu (China's Quora) about Chinese- Indian relations. I feel this is useful information to share as it summarizes and explains the CCP's current view of India (accurate based on my personal links to CCP) and explains why China behaves so antagonistically. This post is **LONG** but is still much shorter than the original. The original has 9 chapters, chapters 5 - 9 focusing on Chinese military strategy in a Sino- Indian war. In the r/india post I have focused on the politics and reasons for conflict described in chapters 1-4. **For** r/geopolitics **I have added a shortened version of chapter 5 describing the importance of Taiwan in Chinese grand strategy.**  I have left out most of the historical background, Chinese idioms and cultural aspects in an effort to shorten the post. **The most important parts are in bold and italicized, I would highly recommend reading those**. Feel free to pm with any questions, Ill try to answer some in the comments. Apologies in advance for mistranslations and/or incorrect information.

If this post gets enough attention, I will post all the chapters and maybe even the full translation. if you want to read the full post I have attached the link. Google translate is 70% accurate and there are a few very important errors.

**Link to post:** [**https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401**](https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401)

**Chapter One, India is big trouble for China in the future**

Today, China faces significant problems on its borders, totally surrounded by strong neighbors. The United States has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security. Russia. although it has a small population, has a large geographical advantage . Although Sino-Russian relations are good in the short term, it could be a big variable in the long run. However, an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is India. India is very weak on the surface, but has a greater potential for development. If you take the long-term view, India is likely to be a significant power in the future.

One reason many people like to laugh at India is that in the 1980s, the economic strength of China and India was evenly matched, but after China’s reform and opening up, China’s economy grew rapidly, and China’s GDP is now five times that of India. This shows how slow India’s economic growth is. However, if you compare it on a global scale, you can actually find that India’s economic growth is not slow. Since 1980, India’s GDP has increased 30 fold. In contrast, the GDP of other developing countries except China and India has only increased 10 fold, and the GDP of developed countries has even increased 8 fold. To a certain extent, it is not that India’s economic development is slow, but that China’s economic growth is too fast. ***China’s economic achievements conceal India’s economic miracle. If there is no comparison with China, then India’s economic growth can be considered a global miracle.***

On the other hand, China’s rapid economic growth has not come without a price. Due to strict family planning rules, China today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time. India has not implemented such a strict family planning policy, and the proportion of young people is very high. Although this has dragged down economic growth, India’s demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years. We know that young people are the main creators of social wealth, and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of China. To some extent, if the number of young people in India is twice that of China in 2050, even if India’s per capita output is only half of China by then, India’s GDP will be on par with China and become the world’s top three economies.

A power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated, although India is a very weak country at the moment, and the lower limit is low; but the future development potential is very large, the upper limit is very high. Although China is now flourishing, if one day the country is facing an aging crisis, on one hand, fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers, on the other hand, the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time, the national willingness to fight is reduced. At that time, it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising India than it is now.

**Chapter Two, the conflicts between China and India can hardly be reconciled**

It is difficult to reconcile the China-India conflict, just as it was difficult to reconcile the China-Soviet conflict before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The underlying reasons are not explained by ideology, territorial disputes, cultural differences, or foreign policy.

In the 1960s and 1980s, China’s greatest threat was from none other than the Soviet Union. If a torrent of Soviet tanks goes south from Mongolia, it will hit Beijing within a week. Since ancient times, the greatest external threat to China has been from the North. And in modern times, Soviet Russia has assumed this role. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks. This was similar to ancient cavalry, fast and ruthless, able to tear a hole in the opponent's defenses in a very short time

The key issue is that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained absolute geographic superiority . The Soviet Union not only controlled the outer northeast, but also Mongolia. When the Soviet Union did not control Mongolia, if the Soviet Union wanted to attack China, it still had to go south from the Northeast Plain and enter North China after conquering the Shanhai pass. But with control of the Mongolian Plateau, the Soviet Union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking China. Soviet tanks only had to cross the Yinshan Mountains to enter Hebei. After that, Beijing would be basically insecure to defend. In this case, China may only have to move south like the Central Plains dynasties in the past, and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the Soviet army.

This is the fundamental reason why China would fight with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and cooperate with the West without hesitation. As long as Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, China’s national defense cannot be assured. Thanks to an independent mongolia, China and Russia are moving towards reconciliation, in the long run, due to Russia's natural geopolitical suppression, it is still a potential threat, and China and Russia still guard against each other.

Taking the example of the Soviet Union, we can understand why Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile. ***The geography of India is very similar to China The main population centers of China are on the North China Plain, and Beijing is the throat into the North China Plain. The population centers of India are on the Ganges Plain, and New Delhi is the throat to enter the Ganges Plain. The south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline, and the southeast has a large island like Sri Lanka.***

But compared to China, India's geography is extremely bad. All of the core areas of India are in the hands of other countries (Indus river, Lower Ganges, Siri Lanka). India does not have many natural barriers. The coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west, while China only needs to defend the east. This makes India very easy to invade as seen in history. ***This is the reason why India invaded Tibet in the 1960s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time. It cannot be said that India is a militaristic state, but because in the context of geographical disadvantages, it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents.***  
For India, China is the biggest geo-threat. This is because China not only controls the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but also is an ally with Pakistan. Once China and India go to war, India will almost certainly lose without external intervention. India’s Ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage. The geographical disadvantages of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the alliance between China and Pakistan are part of the reasons why China-India relations cannot be reconciled. ***But in the long run, even if China and India can complete the territorial conflicts and China and Pakistan no longer are allies, it will be difficult for China and India to reconcile completely. The reason is that both China and India want to become superpowers and leaders in Asia, inevitably leading to strategic collisions.***  
In the future, if both China and India want to rise up and become leaders in Asia, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise. The key point of the conflict is Southeast Asia, the backyard of both counties. Southeast Asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries. Forming battlegrounds for any major countries. China and India both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region. Southeast Asia has many Chinese and Indians. To a certain extent, Southeast Asia is to China and India what Latin America is to the United States, Eastern Europe is to Germany and Russia, and North Korea is to China and Japan. They belong to the range of interests that must be contested.

Therefore, if both China and India become stronger in the future, they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in Southeast Asia. On land, India can rely on the northeast states to infiltrate Myanmar and radiate to the Indochina Peninsula. On the sea, India can rely on the Andaman Islands to increase its influence on the Southeast Asian islands. This is similar to China. On land, China relies on the Trans-Asian Railway/Pan-Asian Highway to increase its radiation to the Indochina Peninsula, and on the sea, it relies on the Nansha Islands to increase its influence on Southeast Asia.

***Therefore, Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile unless three conditions are met: 1. China withdraws from Tibet, or the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau becomes a neutral buffer area similar to Mongolia; 2. China abandons support for Pakistan; 3. China and India abandon the competition for Southeast Asia. None of these three items can be done by China. Tibet is an indivisible part of our territory. Although India has long supported ""Tibet independence"", it is impossible for China to give up Tibet. It is also impossible for China to give up support for Pakistan, Because once you let India unify South Asia, India will be the spearhead aimed at our country. Even more difficult to deal*** ***with. It*** ***is also impossible to give up Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is our natural economic backyard, and has economic and military dual significance.***

In the short term, the main contradictions are 1 and 2, but as India's national strength over Pakistan get bigger and bigger, we cannot rule out that one day Pakistan will be completely defeated by India or even annexed, by that time China's direct geopolitical threat to India will be greatly reduced, if India can also annex Nepal, Bhutan and other countries, then it will have a pivot point in the Tibetan Plateau, and it will be difficult for China to go over the Tibetan Plateau to directly invade India. At this time, the Sino-Indian territorial dispute will no longer be the main conflict, and the main conflict will change to a struggle for spheres of influence.

***The nature of India's threat is the same as that of Russia and Japan; it is a territorial and existential threat. India, on the one hand, has ambitions to encroach on our territory, which is different from the United States, which focuses on economic interests. India also has attempts to dominate South Asia and encroach on Southeast Asia. When China is strong, both the United States and India will adopt a hostile policy toward China; but when China is in decline, the United States may relax its restrictions , but India will not. If one day India is strong and China is weak, then India will intensify its aggression against our territory and even threaten the safety of our national life and property.***

**Chapter Three, the dilemma of two-front warfare, China does not occupy an absolute advantage on the Sino-Indian border**

***The Chinese front is too long and needs to be guarded separately.***

To the east is Japan and South Korea, to the southeast is Taiwan that has not yet returned, to the south are the Southeast Asian countries with territorial disputes, and to the north is Russia, which has occupied the most territory in China in history. In the west of our country, the situation is more complicated. There are religious and ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang and Tibet, and India is eyeing them. This means that although our country is strong, it needs to be guarded by separate troops

Division of Chinese theaters and deployment of forces:

Northern Theater -- 3 army groups, North Sea Fleet-- Russia, Korean Peninsula

Eastern Theater -- 3 army groups, East China Sea Fleet, half of the air force-- U.S., Japan, Taiwan

Southern Theater -- 2 army groups, South China Sea Fleet-- United States, Southeast Asian countries

Central Theater -- 3 armies-- Guards the capital and reserve for other war zones

Western Theater-- 2 armies-- India

Division of Indian military districts and deployment of forces:

Northern Military District -- 3 army groups -- Kashmir, the western section of the China-India border

Western Military Region -- 4 army groups -- Middle section of the China-India border

Eastern Military Region -- 3 armies, East Sea Fleet -- Eastern section of the China-India border

Central Military Region -- 1 army -- Guarding the capital

Southwest Military Region-- 1 army --- Pakistan

Southern Military Region -- 2 armies, West Sea Fleet -- Guarding South India

India can use most of its military power against China. The Indian army has 1.15 million troops and has a total of 14 armies, of which 10 are dedicated to fighting China, accounting for 70% of its army. As for the navy, when a war breaks out between China and India, if the United States and India have good relations, India can send its entire navy to the Andaman Islands to block the Strait of Malacca. While most of the Chinese navy will be deployed in the Pacific to confront the United States and Japan. In terms of air force, northern India has a flat terrain and numerous airports, which can accommodate all the fighters of the Indian Air Force. However, there are not enough airports in Tibet to park a large number of fighters. ***If a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, how much force can be used to fight against India?***

It may be difficult for China to deploy troops on a large scale to support the battlefield, because each army group has clear responsibilities. Once a large number of troops are deployed, it will inevitably lead to weakness and give other countries a chance. For example, the 82nd Army is used to guard the capital , the 82nd Army is equipped to fight on the Great Plains, its plateau combat ability is not a strong point  
***This means that once a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, we may only be able to mobilize 5 army groups to fight, while the Indian side can mobilize at least 10 armies in response.*** Due to restrictions on the throughput of Tibet’s airports, the number of soldiers that can be sent to Tibet is also relatively limited, and most of the air force still has to stay in the east to confront the United States and Japan. As the Strait of Malacca is controlled by other countries, the possibility of our navy crossing the Strait of Malacca and fighting the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean is currently unlikely. Therefore, theoretically speaking, China would have to use 40% of the army, less than half of the air force, and close to 0% of the navy in the Sino-Indian war against 70% of the Indian army, close to 100% of the navy and air force. Currently, I believe that if there is no external interference, China can defeat India with only half of its military power. however, In the most likely situation for war, although our military is far stronger than India, it does not occupy an absolute advantage.

***In short, in the context of a potential encounter, China has several major disadvantages against India:***

***1. China's main strategic focus is in the east, 70% of its military power will be used to confront the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and it will not be able to spare a hand to deal specifically with India.***

***2. Since 2016, the United States has gradually locked China as its number one competitor. If China starts a war against India, if it is a protracted war, the United States and the West will inevitably intervene. At that time, there may be wars in Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea. Creating a 2 fronts situation***

***3. 60% of China's oil imports pass through the Strait of Malacca, and a large amount of export trade also goes through this place. Once fighting against India begins, India or the US may take advantage by blockading the Strait of Malacca. China's crude oil reserves can only support 6-12 months during the war***

***4. The risks and pressures of the two- front warfare can be handled in a war against India. However, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is complex and the railway cannot support the logistics required for large-scale military operations.***

 **Chapter 5: Regaining Taiwan is a prerequisite for resolving the Indian issue**

The importance of Taiwan is self-evident. First , Taiwan is a barrier to the southeastern coast. If Taiwan is controlled by an enemy country, the southeast coast of China, the most developed economic area, will become the frontline. Enemy aircraft can take off from Taiwan and bomb Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, etc. Secondly, Taiwan is a springboard for China's eastward exit into the Pacific. If Taiwan is recovered, the East China Sea Fleet can be stationed at Keelung Port. The US and Japan’s naval and air bases will easily become targets for our military, and the United States may shrink the line of defense from Ryukyu to Guam. Around. Therefore, for our country, the strategic value of Taiwan at the moment is far greater than that of Mongolia and southern Tibet.

At present, our military's technical means to regain Taiwan are mature. Our military far exceeds Taiwan's in terms of scale and equipment. The navy, air force, and rocket forces can suppress Taiwan in all directions. The biggest problem in regaining Taiwan lies in US interference. The United States' support to Taiwan can be described as unscrupulous. It not only sells equipment to Taiwan, but also allows the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to be undervalued, allowing Taiwan to enjoy a high trade surplus. This is a treatment that Japan and South Korea do not enjoy. Taiwan is a trump card for the United States to beat China, so the United States will not easily give up. 

***There is a view that the United States will not go to war with China for Taiwan. This view underestimates the determination of the United States to defend its world hegemony. With the rapid rise of China, the United States has already regarded China as its number one competitor.*** Taiwan being the core trump card for the United States to check and balance China. Once the mainland regains Taiwan, the United States will not only lose the Taiwan card, but will also produce a series of domino effects. Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia may fall to China because of the US inaction. By then, the US front in the Western Pacific will be at risk of collapse. In recent years, the United States has tried to suppress China's rise by various means including tariffs, technology, finance, and diplomacy, but they have not achieved the expected results. Therefore, the possibility that the United States may adopt military measures to suppress China in the future cannot be ruled out. The United States may not go to war with China for Taiwan itself, but the United States is likely to use Taiwan as an excuse to go to war with China. A similar example is that in 1914, in order to suppress the rise of Germany, the United Kingdom directly declared war on Germany under the pretext that Germany invaded Belgium and undermined neutrality. Before that, German domestic public opinion believed that Belgium was not worthy of the British war. This strategic misjudgment led to The outbreak of World War I. 

***After regaining Taiwan, China's geopolitical situation will be greatly improved.*** The first is the economic hinterland—the southeast coast- will gain an extra barrier. By then, the East China Sea Fleet can deploy to Taiwan and extend the maritime defense zone by 500 kilometers. The land defense situation will also be improved. First of all, the Eastern Theater will no longer need to maintain the size of the three army groups. The 73rd army stationed in Fujian can be transferred to the western theater to fight against India.",geopolitics,Russia

Since at least the nineteenth century with the rise of mass politics and modernity various forms of ideologies have been dominating public discourse and vying for control.

Liberalism has been the dominant in the recent era in it's various forms across much of the Americas, Europe, Japan, India, turkey among others while various forms authoritarian states without any very clear ideology is in power in places like Russia,Egypt and Pakistan. Iran is run by a theocratic ideology while China and some other states like North Korea and Cuba officially profess communism but only in name.

Both radical alternatives to liberalism, fascism and communism crumbled in 1945 and 1989 and now only have niche supports. But now liberalism or neoliberalism itself seems to be falling across the world which makes me think that we are about to see the emergence of new ideologies that will vie for power like happened in the last century so the question is then what will these be or what will these be *like*?

Pan-humanist egalitarianism aiming for a global state?

Radical environmentalism devoting all to repairing and conserving the environment?

Theocratic movements based around the large religions like islamism and Christian Dominionism/integralism? Iran is a sort of example in this.

A resurgences of socialism and communism?

A resurgence of fascism?

A race based civilizationism based around Samuel Huntington's work?

Old style ethnic nationalism?

Here's my two cents.,462.0,o0jyfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/o0jyfb/i_think_turkey_is_an_extremely_misunderstood_us/,186.0,1623778652.0,"Turkey opposes Russia in basically every front imaginable. Libya (where France’s support is against USA's interest), Syria, Azerbaijan, Ukraine etc, everywhere Turkey is in direct opposition to Russian position.

Forget about Libya, Syria, Azerbaijan maybe (I mean you know those very well). 

Take Ukraine, Turkey is doing what France or Germany should have been doing there. Making military agreements. Yet, as far as I can tell, Turkey doesn’t really hugely benefit neither does Ukraine have any ""huge"" geopolitical significance for Turkey. Granted, a bigger role by someone like Germany is needed to actually stop Russian aggression there.

Similarly, take Afghanistan, after ""official"" US soldiers, Turkey has the highest number of troops there. For what you ask? To serve US interest.

Turkey is also hosting 3.5M refugees or something like that (which is a pretty significant burden). I mean hosting that many people could destabilise entire country’s political balance.

Turkey also plays vital role in many other areas of geopolitical significance for the USA. Too many to write in one sitting.

Yet, there seems to be considerably negative public opinion on Turkey among the populace. Especially in Reddit and Youtube.

Also, the media spins surrounding Turkey also seems to be negative.

But I think this is bad for USA's relations with Turkey. As I think alienating Turkey would ultimately lead to them entering the Chinese sphere of influence.

One thing people point out is Turkey’s power projection. A lot of which is in fact, in support of USA's interest.

Also, Turkey seems to be growing in influence around the region and the Muslim populace. But, I mean, come on. If Turkey develops economically, it is inevitable that its influence would grow and so would its significance. What ultimately matters is that Turkey keeps on performing its roles in USA's interests.

Some people point out that, Turkey purchased the S400, therefore, Turkey is joining the Russia belt. But this line of thinking completely avoids any of the ground reality.

Turkey is a sworn enemy of Russia in almost every geopolitical spaces they are fighting in.

India is also in on S400. Should USA also distance itself from India for that reason? No.

Now, some people point out about growing authoritarianism in Turkey. But this is a complete bs non-issue.
As long as USA's interest is being performed by a country, USA never cares about what goes on within that country. Dictators, human rights violations etc all are done or present in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the other usual suspects. USA itself is probably the biggest savage of all. I don't think authoritarian tendencies should concern the USA as long as that country performs USA's geopolitical interests.

Now, regarding authoritarianism. I don't think Erdogan can do anything if he loses an election. The Turkish state is much bigger than Erdogan.
He is kinda like Trump. Popular among rural voters, conservative voters. And just like Trump, the more the media vilifies Erdogan, the more vote he gets.

But, just as Trump failed to do anything when he failed the election, Erdogan will also be unable to do anything. However, vilifying his voter base could even lead to him winning the election.

Although I think Erdogan will lose the next election due to the ongoing economic challenges in Turkey and the ongoing currency crisis.

Thus, I think this constant narrative of ""Turkey bad"" is incredibly harmful for US's geopolitical interests. And we should try to have more nuance while talking about this country. 
Moreover, pushing Turkey against USA would mean an incredibly useful and resourceful country will become antagonistic to our country. If USA were to win against the Chinese threats, it would be more useful if USA and Turkey remained true partners. 

Might I also point out that Turkey is probably the only Muslim country that has denounced Chinese aggression against Uyghurs in an official capacity, unlike some other so called allies of the USA.

TL;DR: USA and Turkey have a good partnership. Recent media and popular narrative against Turkey is unhelpful for overall geopolitical interest of the USA.",geopolitics,Russia

The increasing assertiveness of a rising China causes serious concern in New Delhi, but is seen as the best bet towards multi-polarity in Moscow. ""India continues to participate in the BRICS group and other multilateral forums dominated by Russia and China, without any anxiety about open differences with the former and ongoing conflicts with the latter. At the same time, New Delhi is pushing vigorously to strengthen the Quad framework."" This is a shift from non-alignment to what the author considers ""an unapologetic pursuit of an interest-based foreign policy."" While improving relations with Western powers India is also suffering setbacks in its neighborhood.Recent events in Afghanistan are further straining relations between India and Russia. While Moscow desires stability and sees the new administration as the most likely to achieve this, India is deeply concerned about growing Pakistani influence.  
\[Added info\] Russian arms exports have decreased by 22% from 2016-2020. While increasing exports to Algeria, China and Egypt, 90% of the drop are attributed to India reducing Russian arms imports by 53% ([Sipri, 2021](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/international-arms-transfers-level-after-years-sharp-growth-middle-eastern-arms-imports-grow-most)). \[/end\]  
Russia is trying to normalize relations between Beijing and New Delhi through formats like BRICS and is trying to keep good relations with India through new top level communication channels but the author thinks that ""the conflict \[...\] is now deeply structural; diplomatic Band-Aids are not going to fix the problem.""  
Future:  
The author notes that this new complex mechanic between Russia and India is due to their respective relations with Beijing and Washington. This and Russian cooperation with Pakistan on Afghanistan is likely to further the rift between Moscow and New Delhi.

I think the author presents a plausible case and was wondering how deeply Russian and Indian economies are intertwined and how reliant Indian defense still is on Russian arms, even when we have already seen efforts to address this possible security risk.

India being a democracy, the Modi government is also more accountable to public opinion. I must admit that Indian internals are hard for me to understand sometimes. How is the public perception of Russia, is the recent divergence of interests noticed?

I was also hoping to gain some opinions on how big the rift between the two could possibly become. Russia being in an ""uneasy alliance"" with China it relies, and will probably continue to rely, on India as a counterweight. But could increased Russian involvement with Pakistan or an increasingly dominant China lead to adversarial relations between New Delhi and Moscow? Could India ""trade"" the Russian veto for the US veto on Kashmir or is it no longer relevant?

140,Will US go to war with China over Taiwan?,460.0,rm8h37,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rm8h37/will_us_go_to_war_with_china_over_taiwan/,337.0,1640189559.0,"Long time lurker of this sub. So there's been a lot of talk of war with China over Taiwan, most of it focusing on how to fight the war and how likely will Taiwan + US win. What I haven't seen a lot of is whether US will actually go to war with China. 

From what I can see: 

1. Taiwan is not in US backyard, there isn't much in US's core strategic interest to fight China over Taiwan. (Freedom of navigation in SCS is important but not CORE interest)

2. It's not gonna be an easy fight, nuclear or not. Conventionally, the logistics to move enough materiel to fight in West Pacific is very expensive. And with Chinese A2/AD capabilities, it's not gonna be a walkover like desert storm. 

3. Will US citizens support an expensive (in both treasure and American lives terms) war with China? The last time Japan tried to be a hegemon in West Pacific, there was serious consideration under War Plan Orange to not get embroiled in war, had Japan not bombed Pearl Harbour. I mean, it's easy to talk and say yeah kill the Chinese and sit on their skulls, but is the average American citizen okay with sending their loved ones to fight China over Taiwan?

**Edit: Wow. This is actually my first time posting on Reddit. I'm amazed by the range and quality of responses and have tried to read through all of them. A few key points I keep seeing pop up, so I thought I'll do a bit of clarification here.

A. Let's assume the timeline isn't tight. Of course right now its impossible for war, if only because military buildup takes time (for all parties involved). But I guess what I'm asking is more general. Say, over the next 20 years, given current trends, what are the likelihoods of war with China?

B. For those who say the Chinese military is a paper tiger, I think its hardly grounded in reality? I mean, Sec Def recently labelled China as a ""pacing challenge"". A kind of benchmark you measure your own military progress on. And even if right now PLAN is no match for the 11 CVBG the US has, they are building up capability at an incredible rate. A new ship being commissioned every month + a Carrier that is at least on par with Kitty Hawk (maybe even Nimitz without the nuclear propulsion) with some EMALS thrown in is scheduled to be commissioned early 2022. China only commissioned her first carrier in 2012, and she's not that far behind US already, tech wise. And that's not including the rapidly expanding hypersonic anti-ship missile arsenal to keep the USN at maximum range. All this to say, US will be fighting a near-peer competitor, and I wonder what's the appetite for such a fight? Because sure as hell, it will be a war of attrition.

C. Playing the devil's advocate here, those who mention that the US is unlikely to go to war and instead just sanction China, how effective will those sanctions be? China is not like Iran, and economic sanctions affect it wayyyyy less. In fact, if we look at the trends for the last 30 years, China's dependence on FDI has dropped from 6% in the 1990s to right now 1% of GDP. https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/CHN/china/foreign-direct-investment. Export as % of GDP has also dropped significantly from 30% to now hovering around 15%. Of this 15%, US comprises roughly 17.5% of Chinese exports) 
And also, that's what the Belt and Road is for. It's a precursor to a new global institution based on Chinese rules, using a digital yuan that is free from US influence, so that China can break out of US encirclement in the economic sphere. 

D. EU is largely NATO, but has different policy concerns as US, and will not always follow US in policy. (I mean, just look at France breaking away from AUKUS Olympic boycott) We tend to think of EU being US's wingman, but when it comes down to it, if said policy doesn't align with EU's interest, they will walk away. Yes, it IS in EU interest to maintain FoN in SCS because according to UNCTAD, at least 30% of world trade flows through there. HOWEVER, the only reason why EU has trade flowing through there is because it is primarily trading with China (rest of SEA account for very little trade by % of EU). EU is already bristling with Russia, and to be able to exert maximum pressure, it can't afford to also open another economic rift with China. Getting EU buy-in to a broader war with China over Taiwan seems really difficult. And then there's S.Korea. S.Korea has been taking a very conciliatory approach towards China, once again for economic reasons, and that China is so near to it. AFAIK, the military alliance between S.Korea/Japan and US is of a defensive nature, i.e. they're not obligated to declare war if they are not personally invaded. Japan is facing a population crunch already (decades ahead of China), and its just really bad policy to send your remaining young people to war. 

E. Getting Taiwan = getting dominance over Westpac. This part I have some difficulty following. Some comments mention that if China manages to take Taiwan, China will get dominance over Westpac. I mean, isn't there Guam, Wake Islands, Haiwaii further west, and then NZ and AUS, not to mention Japan and the 2nd island chain? 

F. Regarding strategic importance of SCS. From what I understand, US's interest in maintaining FoN in SCS lies primarily in trade (correct me if im wrong). US would lose out a chunk if China achieves hegemonic status in SEA, but in the grand scheme of things, its not something that will cripple US. I mean, US's 3 largest trading partners excluding China are the EU, Mexico and Canada. SEA accounts for 6% of its world trade only.",geopolitics,Russia

There have been many articles talking about the rift between NBA and China. While, some might not consider this a worthy topic for this sub, but I think its very important, because of the following reasons

* Generated considerable media attention in both US and China
* Shows Chinese influence in corporate America
* A sign of deepening ideological rift between America and China

The article I will be looking at is from Sinocism  [**The NBA's poisoned China chalice**](https://sinocism.com/p/the-nbas-poisoned-china-chalice)

Now there are a lot of people who might not like me writing about this, as they didn't like the previous post  [Overview of China Influence and Interference Activities in Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ddbfg7/overview_of_china_influence_and_interference/)

There was a post the other day titled [What is the maximum pressure the US can put on China short of war?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/dep6y9/what_is_the_maximum_pressure_the_us_can_put_on/) And some one wrote the following

>China understand this well, so it intentionally avoid escalate the  current struggle into ideological fight, which would cause a new cold  war. that's why it never put huge effort like RT of Russia. CGTN rarely  trash USA, most of the time it only promotes domestic development.

Is it really non-ideological? According to George Kennan's Long Telegram  which he sent as Charge d'Affair at American embassy in Moscow in 1946, the Soviet Union posed a threat to liberal democracy at Home (ie the US). This Long Telegram served as a basis for the US Containment policy of the Soviet Union.

>In summary, we have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with US there can be no permanent modus vivendi that it is desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be disrupted, our traditional way of life be destroyed,

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union couldn't get an institution anywhere as influential as  the NBA to force an American to censor what he said so openly and blatantly, like how China pressured the NBA with regards to  Daryl Morey  Had this happened in the 1960s, the NBA would be investigated under [Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act) , and people would have been sent to jail.

There are many who consider this isn't geopolitics, it is OK with me. The Cold War was motivated by fear, and right now China is generating fear and anger in the US public This sort of incident will only stiffen the resolve of the China hawks in the US. The China doves will have even more difficult time persuading Congress that China isn't a threat.

# RELEVANT ARTICLES

There have been two recent incidents about Chinese interference in the US or involving US companies - [South Park](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/article/south-park-sends-satirical-rocket-to-china/) and [Blizzard](https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung). I am not going to spend any time discussing these incidents. Here are some relevant and serious articles about the NBA-China incident

[The NBA Is China’s Willing Tool](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/07/us-businesses-like-the-nba-are-chinas-willing-tools/) (Foreign Policy)

[NBA vs. China: The Power Struggle Behind the Standoff](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-vs-china-the-power-struggle-behind-the-standoff-11570557671) (Wall Street Journal)

[The Foreign Agents Registration Act Is Broken](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/22/the-foreign-agents-registration-act-is-broken/) (Foreign Policy). FARA is a piece of legislation that was introduced in 1938 to guard against Nazi influence in the US. After the 1966s, it had rarely been used.  [However, the DOJ has brought almsot as many FARA cases in the last 18 months as in the last 40 years](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/fara-law-explained-794340/). FARA as explained in the Foreign Policy article is nasty and far ranging legislation, one does not want to get caught in its cross hairs.

# SUMMARY

The incident started when Daryl Morey, the General Manager of Houston Rockets, a NBA team, wrote the following tweet, "" Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong "" than the commercial gates of hell for both the Rockets and NBA according to Sinocism.

The articles presents John Tsai, the owner of the  Brooklyn Nets  and Executive VP of Alibaba and those of Adam Silver, the NBA Commissioner.. This is what Adam Silver had to say,

>""There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,"" he said.  ""There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet,  and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting  Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.""  
>  
>""I think as a values-based  organization that I want to make it clear...that Daryl Morey is  supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of  expression.""..  
>  
>""What I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation,"" he said.  
>  
>""I  am also supporting Joe Tsai. I realize, as I said again, these are  complex issues they don't lend themselves easily to social media. I  can't ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on  Twitter.""

The article makes the following points, it says the NBA as leverage in China, if it presents a united front. It could backfire, since there is bipartisan outrage in Congress regarding this issue.

In a broader context has long wanted to increase its ""international discourse power  国际话语权“ . It comes into forms 1) On the one hand it is launching, buying, co-opting and coercing  overseas media outlets. 2) On the other it uses the power of the Chinese  market to co-opt and coerce global businesses, their executives and  other elite voices.  This is what the Global Times had to say

>The biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities  that value commercial interests must make their members speak  cautiously. Chinese consumers are not overly sensitive. Wherever it is,  touching a raw political nerve is extremely risky. Morey has neither the  IQ nor the EQ to talk about political topics. He will become an example  of clumsiness on some MBA courses.

The writer concludes by taking a quote from [The NBA Is China’s Willing Tool](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/07/us-businesses-like-the-nba-are-chinas-willing-tools/) written by James Palmer

>It will take political power in the United States to [counter political power wielded by China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/11/if-the-u-s-doesnt-control-corporate-power-china-will/).  For U.S. companies to stop appeasing Chinese censorship, corporate  decision-makers are going to have to believe that the reputational and  political costs of doing so outweigh the damage done to their interests  in China.   But it will also need targeted effort from politicians [who say](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1181030464661999616) they  care. That may mean dragging executives to testify about their  decision, forcing more public embarrassment. It may mean threatening the  government contracts and cozy tax breaks that firms often rely on.

# OPINION

To me its not about whether or not you agree with what Daryl Morey said, but whether the Chinese government can pressure a US organization to censor him. This gets into the area of foreign interference,

Unlike the author I think the NBA Commissioner is more worried about the fallout in the US than China. Professional sports in the US is regulated and depends on governments at various levels from municipal, state and federal. NBA is more susceptible to domestic political pressure than your average US company operating in China. Professional sports leagues in the US is socialist. So China's respond to ban the NBA in its entirety was the correct response from economic perspective, given revenue sharing in the NBA.

The NBA has faced bans in the past in China, the first was during the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Serbia, the second was in 2008 for comments made by some players. However, this time is different, not necessarily because its particularly bad, but because its occurring with the overall context of the Trade War and the current political climate in China.

The reason why I think this incident is different from telling the likes of Marriot not to list Taiwan as a separate country, because China was essentially telling the NBA to censor  Daryl Morey, thus restricting his First Amendment rights, which isn't a crime itself if   the entity pressuring the NBA isn't foreign.  Because a foreign government / entity is pressuring the NBA, this falls under FARA.  The NBA would have to register as a foreign agent.",geopolitics,Russia

150,Russia's Pacific Strategy,442.0,ruegag,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ruegag/russias_pacific_strategy/,142.0,1641144390.0,"With the eyes of the world fixated on Russia’s border with Ukraine, Moscow is beginning to make major moves 7500km to the East on the Russian Pacific coast. Most major powers have already begun their pivot to Asia, and now Russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. Will Russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant China in this theatre? 

With its heartland west of the Ural Mountains, Russia has long been tightly Europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the Indo-Pacific, Moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. These regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the Soviet Era, and aside from hosting Russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in Vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in Moscow since much of Nuclear forces were redeployed to Kola.   
At present Vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the Kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. The Russian *Vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving Russia could rapidly deploy forces to the Pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of Kremlin planners. The exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. The Russian forces have been a predominately Western focused force, and that stokes fears that the Russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the Pacific front continues to gain importance.   

To try and combat this Putin set in motion his own Pivot to Asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the Russian far-east. Little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in Kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

This issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in Russian surface fleets. With 5 fleets to modernise, Russia’s Pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its Baltic, Northern, and even Black Sea fleets meaning that Vladivostok continues to receive the Russian navies leftovers.  Although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia’s hegemony in the region. 

With an ascendant China in the region though is Russia being delegated to a junior partner? We certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between Russian forces and the PLA and PLAN, and in those operations Russia has largely taken a backseat to China in regional issues, such as Korea. The caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still haven’t seen what would happen if China and Russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. The closeness of the Russia-China relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. For the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

The question I would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for Moscow to place the Pacific front on the same priority level as the Northern or Black Sea fronts, and how would Moscow react to a conflict in the South China sea?   
My gut feeling is that Russia would assist China with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in Europe? I am keen to get this subs thoughts though.

But what if these aren't the best options? Ignoring Ukraine for the moment, what if it is better to let China have Taiwan and then fight on terms better suited to the USA and its allies?

To defend Taiwan would mean putting a lot of US assets into danger - major fleet units would need to sail within range of shore-based aircraft and terminally-guided IRBMs, USMC ships would be even more vulnerable and any fight would be in contested airspace. China's huge SSK fleet is designed to fight in the Straits as are its short-range assets.

Would it not be better to trade 'space for time' as NATO planned to do in a war against the WP? This would enable the USA to utilise its force multipliers without keeping one eye on the clock. The Chinese invasion fleet is a one-shot weapon. It will suffer massive attrition from ROC defences alone, without outside assistance, and the people of Taiwan will not meekly submit to the CCP. The PLA can look forward to constant attrition and civil disobedience.

In the meantime, the US and allies can just pick off the Chinese multipliers one at a time until the PLA is a shadow of its former self and most of the Straits are covered in shipwrecks and splashed aircraft. Until national infrastructure (much less robust than that in the west) is collapsing and sanctions, combined with destruction/surrender of Chinese O/S assets (Gwadar, Trincomalee) are driving China towards starvation and economic collapse with no fuel for their military, no food or power for their people and an increasingly disruptive populace.

Surely this is better than fighting the enemy on a battlefield of his choosing at a time of his choosing?

EDIT 1. Thanks for the awards. I think this post has done its job of stimulating discussion of the matter.

EDIT 2. There seem to be a lot of commenters mistakenly thinking that I'm advocating the abandonment of Japan, ROC and ROK. This is not the case. These nations may suffer short-term pain from a lack of US 'boots on the ground' (or, more accurately, carriers nearby), but their survival depends on the ability of the US to project power, a power I believe will be severely attrited if it attempts to fight the long war on Chinese terms. I am exploring an alternative to the current narrative with the same goal of preserving the independence of Japan and ROK, the de facto independence of Taiwan and the elimination of the PLA threat to Taiwan and the SCS island groups..",geopolitics,Russia

This article will be based on tweets, open sources and speculations from analysts of third parties. Take into considerations that no one expects the inner circle of the Kremlin to know what the original plans were and that it is way too to try to make any sense of motivations and reason. Anyone who claims they know what was going on is lying or is propagandizing one side.

**Strange beginning of the year.**

On 21 March 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu in the forest of Siberia for a weekend vacation. The picture showed a smiling President riding off-road vehicles and having a meal with Shoygu in the woods. Only three days later, the movement of troops and equipment started transporting to the Ukrainian border. It is most likely that this was the meeting where the final decision was taken, and some few analysts took notice. The whole photo-op gave the first impression that the troop build-up was sable ratling first of all. The second was the flood of pictures of equipment that went to the border. In thousands of tweets, we could see hobby analysts retweeting Russian images of military equipment, usually followed by very uninformative words like ""this is bad/this is not good"". They were spreading more fear. However, the analysts could take some clues also. Russians did not cover all the sensitive equipment they usually do and was very open about troops and equipment.

On 13 April, some researchers concluded that the war alert was over,\* and by 15th, the U.S. military command had said that the build-up had plateaued and cancelled officially the two warships they promised to send to the Black Sea. Interestingly, the documents needed to cross the Bosphorus were sent in late March, meaning that the U.S. command was only sure that Russia was showing off at some point in mid-April and made the logical decision that having the U.S. ships in the area increased the risk for a conflict.

It was at least one week where the U.S. was not sure about Russian intentions. Around this time, we saw some Western reactions, most noticeable from U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, who in harshly words warned Russia about consequences if Russia starts something in Ukraine. Several U.S., Canadian and U.K. cargo planes landed at Boryspil Airport, most likely bringing military equipment. At some point, something happened that convinced the U.S. that Russia was not planning anything that would change the world order. The aeroplanes stopped coming. Shortly after, it was back to business for the U.S., who announced their long-planned sanctions for Russia. The reader should note that the U.S still provided air surveillance over the border area with drones.

**The lack of details**

There were questions about the adequacy of the logistics present – there was a lot of front-line hardware, very openly paraded, but armies secondary logistics, fuel bowsers, ammunition depots and field kitchen was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 when Russia marched armies near the border, offensive action was ruled out due to the lack of logistics, this time around field hospitals was put up, but the fact that BBC reporter got a lock into the area showed that this was something Russia wanted to show to the world.

In Russian term, it can be a metaphor that in April the army train for whatever comes from August to October. As the mud dries and makes country road possible to drive and thousands of new conscripts comes to serve. The training is always intensified in this period, and by itself, the exercises Russia did was not out of the extraordinary, but the fact that it all happened near the border was.  As more and more forces came, they crossed another checklist on what you need for an offensive. While in 2016 the crisis was quickly brushed aside based on the logistics, this time it felt different. Just like Moscow wanted. The Russian propaganda network at that time also went overdrive with the infamous Russia-1 tv show  Вечер с Владимиром Соловьёвым /Sunday evening with Vladimir Soloyvov calling Ukraine fascists that needed be to stopped. Eventually even the Russian government put out a statement that tv shows and public debate did not reflect the government view on Ukraine.

**The Ukrainian gambit**

2021 was a year Zelensky turned around his domestic policies. He was elected in a landslide in 2019 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the country. He tried to find common ground with Russia, which resulted in a prisoner exchange programme and little else. Frustrated with the lack of compromises Russia gave, he started with a more western friendly policy. He shouts down Russian TV channels and put sanctions on Putin's man in Kyiv, Viktor Medvedchuck.  It was on his background Putin maybe decided to show who Russia was in the region.

Some analysts speculate that Ukraine pushed the situation after a schedule rotation amongst the troops in the frontline of Donbas. That Zelensky added an extra tank battalion along the border. How true this remains to be seen as it was difficult to find any sources to back this up.

As Ukraine can never hope to win in a direct clash against the Russian forces, the Peoples republics in Donbas will collapse within a short time without aid from Russia, a behemoth in armed forces. Ukraine has gone from a corrupt, ineffective army to a normal function one that put up some fight in a potential conflict, making the price for an invasion a little higher in term of blood. However, the soldiers of LPR and DPR are in all categories a militia without any navy or air force. A conflict between Ukraine and the Peoples Republic would be laster much shorter than a war between Ukraine and Russia. In that term, analysts could speculate that Russia development was a strong signal that nothing would happen with Donbas without their permission. Shoygu and Putin could see that annual testing of forces in Crimea and the western part near Ukraine was an excellent way to hit two flies with one swing.

**The Saakashvili trap**

A total invasion of Ukraine was most likely never an option. Such an operation would have demanded much more resources and would be the most significant conflict on European soil since WWII, potentially turning it into a world war. For comparison, the Yugoslavian population right before the split was 22 million, and there is 44 million in Ukraine. Casualties would have been in the hundreds of thousands only indirect fighting. It would have been the total economic collapse for Russia as the international community would have kicked it out of every international agreement such as SWIFT and FX trade. Even Germany could not have defended their economic ties with the country anymore.

The world does not simply work like Victoria 2 anymore. You can not place your troops over a neighbour country capital until you get the choice to annex. Analysts also saw the land grab theory as unlikely to happen. The water shortage crisis in Crimea is severe for Russia, but trying to take control over the dam in Ukraine costs many times what it takes to ship water or build new infrastructure. Furthermore, Some analysts noted that the **Russian national guard** does not deploy to the frontline. This unit is tasked with population control in a hostile environment and would have been needed if concrete plans were to pacify the newly acquired region. If Russia were to control the canal, it would still take years to upgrade it and protect it from Ukrainian sabotage.

What's left was then an escalation in the Donbas region. Most likely, Zelensky was warned by several people not to go into a trap like former Georgian President and now head of the Ukrainian National Reform Council, Mikheil Saakashvili. In 2008 he ordered his troops to answer the escalation in South Ossetia, which gave Russia a casus belli to invade. Ukrainian forces around Donbas did not respond to fire from snipers and held back on mortar shelling, a move that was lauded by the western world. By 21 April, the steam had gone out on the borderline while the increasingly hostile rhetoric from the Russian tv channels cooled down. With Putin's anti-climatic speech on the 21st, the crisis seemed to have peaked.

**The Belarussian**

As a side note, there was also the involvement of the Belarussian President on April 18, where here claimed the U.S had tried to coup the country and kill him. By this time we had observed some Belarussian troops in motion in the southwest part of the country, driving speculation on what the country's role in this buildup was. Furthermore, Lukashenko promised to announce a change he called the biggest of his presidency. As he was scheduled to meet Putin the day after the latter speech to the nation, it was believed and in some cases speculated that the long talked about Union State was happening. However the meeting was about nothing and the announcement was about Lukashenko giving power to the security council, where his son is an influential member if he was assassinated. In those three days between April 21 to April 23, the situation was basically over.

**Who won?**

As the crisis seems to cool down, it might be wrong to say if there was a winner and loser, more the cards have reorganized. It appears that the U.S and the Biden administration managed to play the cards right by making both Russia and China step down while giving support to Ukraine. After all, a non-war is the best success there is.  Russia has tested its infrastructure, prepared a hasty campaign for the future, and got its summit with Biden. Ukraine President Zelensky got support from Erdogan, although the foreign office later vaguely stated they were neutral in the conflict. He also got his long-awaited call with Biden and 300 mln dollar check for new weapons. Money that, if well spent, can fill in some of the weakness in the Ukrainian military. Anti-air weapons, communication equipment and navy expansions should be on top of the wish list for Kyiv.

Although the polls are not back yet, Zelensky might have got out of this with his popularity intact and a new wind to push his reforms. However, his two years as President saw a slow down in the armed forces budget. One of Poroshenko's most enormous success was the turnaround of the military.   Ukrainian and Western officials say Kyiv's more vital armed forces would increase the military cost to Russia of an incursion or invasion. Ukraine's army has evolved from a core of trained soldiers supplemented by volunteer battalions to a more professional corps, hardened by years of fighting. Still, it also demanded about 4% of the country's GDP. It was understandable that Zelensky, who was voted into the office on a domestic and anti-corruption wanted to move those resources. Now he will be forced to follow his predecessor's stance in building up the military.

However, there are some clear losers in this. Many professional NGOs and analysts used public channels to spread fear and conclude that war was imminent, while some few managed to be objective about the situation.

The other losers are the civilians in the occupied areas and around the frontline. Despite this crisis, the situation is deadlocked and Kyiv will not go back to the Minsk agreement.

175,Contextualizing China/Taiwan Relations and Recent Tensions,381.0,wgodxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/wgodxn/contextualizing_chinataiwan_relations_and_recent/,119.0,1659682225.0,"How many times have we heard the stories about Chinese “incursions” into the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan? How many times has Beijing repeated that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People’s Republic of China and that attempts at separatism are “doomed to fail?”

The concept of an impending war in the Taiwan Straits bears a lot of resemblance to the constant Zerohedge-esque paranoia of an impending war between Pakistan and India over Kashmir (Kashmir is a funny one because it’s going to come up later). I’m going to try and lay out the case for why China isn’t about to invade Taiwan.

**The Status Quo Benefits Both Sides**

The current status quo is one that is very beneficial to both Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan has de-facto, although not de-jure independence from China. Meanwhile, Beijing benefits from inward investment from Taiwanese businesses and also gets to boast that Taiwan isn’t an officially recognized country by any of its adversaries like the US.

We’ve heard constantly from Beijing that any move towards Taiwan declaring de-jure independence will be met by a military invasion of the island. But Taiwan doesn’t need to do that at all. Under the current arrangement, Taiwan has its own judicial system, its own elections, its own currency etc etc. Unlike Hong Kong or Macau, which are Special Administrative Regions with a high degree of autonomy and freedom within China, it is not entirely subservient to the whims of the CCP. Beijing doesn’t have troops stationed in Taiwan, nor can they pass laws which have any meaningful effect on anything happening in Taiwan like they could pass a national security law in Hong Kong which severely restrained the pro-democracy movement. For Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, declaring de-jure independence, which would most definitely cross Beijing’s red line on Taiwan, looks like a play with a concave payoff. She can still go around showing off how the territory has full freedom from Beijing without undertaking that drastic action.

On the business side, Taiwan has accumulated almost $200bn in investment in China. Taiwanese SMEs and large corporations alike create plenty of jobs in China. Unsurprisingly, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner. In 2020, Taiwan’s exports to both Mainland China and Hong Kong amounted to US$151.45bn, accounting for 43.9% of total exports. In short, the ambiguity over Taiwan has benefited both sides, politically and economically.

**The CCP Are Now First and Foremost Ultra-Nationalists, Not Warmongers**

The CCP are more ultra-nationalists than they are communists. It is through improving living standards as well as fervent nationalism and propping up anxiety amongst the public that they have maintained their power. If the Taiwan issue is resolved, what problem will Beijing have to whip up nationalist sentiment against and keep the legitimacy of the CCP alive? A permanent state of anxiety from potential interference from foreign powers restricting the rise of China serves the Party quite well. In this case, that would be the situation in Taiwan. It serves as a great reason for the existence of an extremely strong PLA.

Ever since undergoing the “century of humiliation” between 1839 and 1949, the Chinese Communist Party are hell bent on ensuring that China is respected as a world power. Among many things, the Opium Wars and the Sino-Japanese wars were all things which severely harmed the Chinese nation. During this century of humiliation, China had to cede Hong Kong to the British, Macau to the Portuguese and the island of Taiwan to the Japanese. The subsequent peaceful reunification of both Hong Kong and Macau as Special Administrative Regions under Chinese sovereignty went a long way for Beijing in restoring their dignity. But Taiwan is left still un-unified with the Chinese mainland.

Ever since Xi took power in 2012, he’s turned the Party away from its collectivist leadership during the times of Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin into a one-man party. The Party must maintain a strong stance against Taiwanese independence, not because they’re warmongers, but out of an interest of self-preservation. From cracking down on the separatist movement in Tibet, to putting Muslims in “re-education” camps in Xinjiang to counter the extremist East Turkestan Islamic Movement and implementing a national security law in Hong Kong after the SAR’s failure to implement its own as required by Article 23 of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, Xi has relied on ardent nationalism to maintain national unity. You need a certain level of threat from foreign powers, for example alleged CIA backing of Hong Kong democracy activists, to stir support for a strongman government. “Only the CCP will protect the interests of the Chinese nation” is the message he’s trying to send. The Party is basically a mafia protection racket. Solving the Taiwan issue would mean that the state of collective anxiety amongst the public would no longer be there. The nationalism that binds the country’s different factions together in the face of Taiwan would fade away as there is no problem with China’s “territorial integrity” anymore.

All of this is in the name of the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, or the “China dream” as he’s said countless times. If Beijing looks weak then they’ll lose their legitimacy with the Chinese people. So, constant pressure on Taiwan without actually backing military action seems like a stable status quo. Sounds absolutely crazy, right?

Xi is alleged to have gone off the record and told the KMT (the softly pro-Beijing nationalist party in Taiwan) that accepting a de-jure declaration of independence would lead to the overthrowing of the Chinese government.

However, China’s policy has always been for **peaceful** reunification (resorting to invasion would lead to numerous problems which I will go into later). In the event of a re-unification with the Mainland, it is envisioned by Beijing that Taiwan would not be a standard Mainland province, but a Special Administrative Region. The Taiwan situation is exactly how the “One Country, Two Systems” formula originated. Now, you can talk about the flaws of the system, especially its implementation in Hong Kong, but the point I’m trying to get here is that Beijing is not planning on turning Taipei into a standard Mainland city.

In fact, Beijing still recognises the situation to be different in Taiwan to such an extent that **they’re willing to offer Taiwan control of the military forces on the island**, something which it never has offered nor implemented in Hong Kong or Macau where the control of the PLA garrison falls entirely under the remit of Beijing, in an effort to try and solve some of the evident mistrust that exists between the island of Taiwan and the central authorities in Beijing.

Even at the time of writing, giving a speech on the anniversary of the overthrowing of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Xi vowed “peaceful reunification” and made no mention of using any force, in contrast to his words in 2019.

**“Incursions” into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone**

This is where things get complicated. Internationally, Taiwan isn’t recognized as a country. It’s not a sovereign state, de-jure. Nonetheless, it has an air defense identification zone (ADIZ), which extends well beyond Taiwanese airspace. It’s objective is to act as a zone to identify any potential invasion.

Basically, any aircraft going past the median line is recorded as an “incursion”. The whole game is one of psychological warfare. By constantly make the Taiwanese scramble jets, they actually tire out the Taiwanese. It’s also super expensive to constantly scramble fighter jets. Beijing also gets to consistently apply pressure on the DPP government in Taiwan, as the relatively more pro-Beijing KMT can criticise the incumbent government for failing to maintain good relations with China and then argue that only the KMT can maintain peaceful cross-strait relations and maintain stability on the island. Think of the fighter jets as something more like Russian aircraft flying near the UK, or the US Navy exercising “freedom of navigation” in the South China Sea. It’s all meant to exert a form of geopolitical pressure. It’s not a symbol of impending invasion.

The whole narrative of Beijing consistently breaching Taiwanese airspace is a convenient narrative for the media, but obviously far from the truth. Beijing has been very careful not to go too far past the median line. It would be a very different situation if there were Chinese jets over Taipei.

The concept of a nation’s ADIZ is very different from airspace. The Convention on International Civil Aviation says that a nation’s airspace extends 12 nautical miles from the low water line along the coast of a state. There’s been a lot of argument about overlapping ADIZ's in the region. Just have a look at how they overlap here:

I hope that dispels some of the myths regarding the Taiwan ADIZ “incursions”.

**The Problems With Invading Taiwan**

**The Chinese Communist Party are much better at stirring up fervent ultra nationalism than they are at carrying out military threats**. All bark and no bite, at least on the Taiwan issue. Bold statement, you might say. Remember when a certain Senator suggested that there were US troops in Taiwan and then the Chinese state media responded in their classic aggressive style?

[it turns out there are actually US special forces on the island and they’re helping train Taiwanese forces, according to the Wall Street Journal.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211009201215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-troops-have-been-deployed-in-taiwan-for-at-least-a-year-11633614043)Where’s the promised invasion? Where is the resolute crushing of China’s largest adversary? Nothing. Xi’s recent speech actually toned the rhetoric down slightly. This revelation is hugely embarrassing for the Party, and yet, there still aren’t jets flying over Taipei. It’s actually an extremely serious matter, as US troops are technically on Chinese territory, if we are talking about internationally accepted norms. The truth is that invading Taiwan is an incredibly risky proposition, just from a purely technical perspective. China has absolutely no experience in amphibious assaults, especially a terrain like Taiwan’s. The island has also been building up on a strategy of asymmetric defence, to ensure that any PLA invasion will be met with heavy losses on both sides. Call me when troops land on the shores of Taiwan.

Now let’s say if they invaded Taiwan. Then what? They’ll have to commit lots of resources on that side of the country, leaving the Western front exposed. China cannot afford to look vulnerable on its border with India. It doesn’t make sense to do anything of the sort.

**There’s also a significant political risk in invading Taiwan:**

Over the years, Xi has built up a political monopoly on power within the Party, purging a lot of his rivals in the process of his “anti-corruption” campaigns. This leaves him particularly vulnerable should an invasion of Taiwan go wrong. It’s quite a difficult amphibious assault, and Taiwan has been preparing with an asymmetric defence strategy. Not only is it technically difficult, it’s extremely expensive. Is there going to be public appetite for spending billions of dollars on a war in the Taiwan Straits?

The reason China has long emphasised for a peaceful reunification is because the people of Taiwan and China are actually ethnic brothers and sisters. Taiwan’s Han Chinese folk account for 95% of the total population, and they also speak Mandarin as their main language.

“**Guided by the conviction we are all of the same family”, “Blood is thicker than water”.** The Chinese people actually do see the Taiwanese as part of their family. There is absolutely no political appetite to start killing their own people. When the PLA opened fire on the patriotic student protestors in Beijing, there was huge condemnation from lots of the Chinese population, including senior members of the Party. A massive purge of those who were sympathetic to the movement followed. A bloody invasion of Taiwan would be 100x worse than Tiananmen for the Party. This definitely would not be the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” that Xi has been hammering on about since he took power. No leader wants to be the one to oversee these kind of actions. Each one has passed the responsibility of figuring out what to do with Taiwan onto the next, precisely because of the fear that a wrong move could upend the entire legitimacy of the Party. Launching a war against what are essentially their own people would cause incredible instability within the CCP. The topic of “common prosperity” itself has triggered a rare spectacle of intense debate within China, with the now famed blogger Li Guangman on one side calling for a “profound revolution” sending shockwaves across the country and the establishment on the other side emphasising the fact that they’re not trying to rob Peter to pay Paul. I don’t want to imagine what launching a full-scale military invasion against Taiwan would look like in the court of public opinion in China.

The Communist Party has also gone out of its way to emphasise that it does not do things like the United States. China has never invaded countries thousands of miles away from its shores in dubious circumstances. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Mali are all examples of Western military aggression. China has always preferred trade and investment as a tool of gaining influence around the world rather than invasion. Invading Taiwan would kill the image of the Party as one which is a non-aggressor, at least on the international stage. The notion that China will not bully any other country, one backed by Xi himself, would be entirely down the drain. An invasion no doubt would whip up Japan, Australia, India and the United States. They simply can’t afford the political risk from the invasion itself, let alone a botched invasion. While no one can predict what the international reaction will be, severe action like sanctions and isolation remain a tail-risk, although one can say it does seem for Russia that their annexation of Crimea doesn’t seem to have changed a whole lot. Other tail-risks include US military intervention, but then again, there might not be any appetite for US military action after what’s happened in Afghanistan. There’s a lot of unknown variables which could come into play during this invasion, just further emphasising how much downside risks there are to Beijing in the event of a military assault on the island of Taiwan.

Invading Taiwan would also come at an enormous economic cost. As of now, China is still reliant on Taiwan being a stable island, as is the whole world. If Beijing wanted to annex the island and actually gain any benefit from it, they will need to leave it intact, something which will not be possible if a war breaks out. TSMC is the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. China hasn’t achieved independence in semiconductors just yet, but they’re trying to.

The world is pretty dependent on TSMC in the semiconductor supply chain, and so a war would be disastrous for the whole world. As a result, the only realistic option in reunifying is a peaceful one.

To finish off, the only discernible benefit of invading will be the ability to claim that the entire Chinese nation has been re-united. But the downside risks are numerous, and just like how declaring de-jure independence would have a concave payoff for Tsai Ing-wen, invading Taiwan would have a concave payoff for Xi. It doesn’t make political or economic sense to do so. Both sides benefit from an ambiguous status quo, and it’s most likely to stay that way. Beijing is more likely to continue its war in the greyzone, through incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ, launching cyberattacks, having pro-China tycoons buy up media outlets, as well as employing bots and trolls to push Chinese propaganda and misinformation. The talk of impending war is primarily being driven by the “Air incursion” narrative, which as I’ve explained earlier, is a shaky argument at best.

Note that in Hong Kong, they didn’t even bring out the PLA and PAP when rioters were throwing petrol bombs at the courts and central government buildings, as well as taking over the Legislative Council, the territory’s parliament. They could have done so by declaring a state of emergency in Hong Kong (arguably, the mass riots were an emergency), but they chose to exercise restraint, to try and maintain their image on the world stage. They didn’t want a Tiananmen 2.0 in an international city like Hong Kong.

It’s going to take something really bad for Beijing to drop its peaceful reunification policy and to go for a military solution.",geopolitics,Russia
176,"Are Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Greece countries with more or less the same ""amount"" of international importance, influence and power as Sweden?",373.0,pievwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/pievwd/are_norway_the_netherlands_poland_and_greece/,171.0,1630854894.0,"Sweden is not a superpower at all and it's not a country with a high level of influence (such as Russia or China). However, it has a relatively large GDP for its population and it's known that Sweden is one of the most developed countries in the world. Besides, it has been described as the most important country of the Nordic Countries, due to its population (which is the largest among these countries) and its historic relative importance.

I was wondering what countries (preferably inside Europe) can compare to Sweden in terms of international influence, power and importance. I mean, countries with not a very high level of these characteristics but with a relatively big amount of them considering its size and population.

I was thinking about the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, Greece, and possibly Portugal Romania and Finland.

The Netherlands, because it is the most important country of the ""Benelux"" and for its size, it has a relatively large importance. It has even been described as the ""Most important nation of all the small nations"".

Poland because it has the second biggest economy of the countries in the ""Slavonic"" world (after Russia) and it is one of the most developed ones.

Norway because, despite its relatively small population, it has valuable resources (such as petroleum) and it is one of the richest and well developed countries in the world.

Greece because it has traditionally been the most well developed country in the zone of the Balkans (although sometimes Greece is excluded when we talk about this region) if not the most developed, despite its profound economic crisis. Until recently, it had the biggest economy in the zone, but it was surpassed by Romania, if we include Romania (or at least parts of the Romanian territory) to be in the Balkans. Also, ancient Greek culture had an enormous impact and influence in the western civilization.

About Portugal, Finland and Romania I am not sure (for example, Romania has a relatively high GDP for its local region, but it is still not as well developed as other countries with those levels of GDP).

177,How popular is the 'reverse-Nixon strategy' for Russia? Is it becoming more palatable?,370.0,nxukl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/nxukl2/how_popular_is_the_reversenixon_strategy_for/,140.0,1623458651.0,"Last month, Foreign Affairs published an excellent article which was posted here, titled [""China and Russia’s Dangerous Convergence.""](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-05-03/china-and-russias-dangerous-convergence) In addition to being part of a growing trend of geopolitical analysts and journalists recognizing, if not hyping up, the danger of the emerging China-Russia partnership, it also explicitly mentioned the ""reverse-Nixon strategy"" of dealing with Russia. Referring, of course, to the proposal of appeasement with Russia in order to counter China. Ultimately, the article rejected the approach in favor of attempts to cause a rift between China and Russia through strategies such as allowing India to buy Russian weapons, but its acknowledgement of the idea, and the danger China-Russia represents, seems to be significant.

Is there a growing popularity for a softer approach to dealing with Russia, at least among the think tanks and journalists? President Biden notably [considered Michael Rojansky](https://www.axios.com/biden-national-security-council-russia-director-15d02b7f-f4ca-4386-93a7-893c06947ea3.html) for the role of Russia advisor, although the idea faced criticism due to Rojansky's alleged softness on the Kremlin. Clearly, the idea is not terribly popular in the Democratic Party for obvious domestic reasons. On this subreddit in particular, there have been numerous threads questioning the value of NATO's expansion and commitment to Eastern Europe. Others have written off Russia as a dead or dying power. But the recognition that China is the greatest threat to Western/American interests seems to be relatively unchallenged - and it is the assistance that Russia is offering to China (not vice versa) that has the authors of the above article most worried.

This leads me to several questions I'm curious about:

* Is the 'reverse-Nixon strategy' conceivable? Is it becoming a more popular idea in geopolitical circles?
* What would be the consequences of 'letting Russia have Ukraine' in its sphere of influence? Is Ukraine truly meaningful to Western interests?
* How dangerous is the growing partnership between Russia and China? What action should it warrant?",geopolitics,Russia

For this episode we have  
JONATHON WINER - Former Deputy Assistant US Secretary of State and Special Envoy to Libya  
JALEL HARCHAOUI - The Clingendael Institute  
and TAREK MEGERISI - European Council on Foreign Relations

We go over how the struggle started, where its heading and what is at stake for both sides and just how wide-ranging the impacts of the war will be. We also go right into why Russia, Turkey, Italy, France, Qatar, Egypt, Tunisia and the UAE are pouring weapons and arms into this already destructive war.  


Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know to try and understand the country in its current state, what the Gulf states, Turkey and Russia are up to, and why the US is staying out of it for now.   


We also decided to leave it some of the more controversial points this time, including the outcomes of the US taking drastic measures into the war. 

The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks.

Would love your input and feedback as well.

180,Will 2019 see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East?,370.0,ab87js,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ab87js/will_2019_see_a_major_geopolitical_realignment_in/,50.0,1546271190.0,"During the last two months of 2018, four major developments have occurred in Syria.

First, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [deployed troops](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20181122-saudi-arabia-uae-send-troops-to-support-kurds-in-syria/) into Northern Syria to be stationed with American troops and their Kurdish allies.

Second, the United States [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html) that it was withdrawing all forces from Syria.

Third, the Kurds [asked](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-kurds-ask-assad-govt-for-protection) the Assad regime to protect them following the American withdrawal announcement.

And fourth, the Gulf states [began to join](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/28/bashar-al-assad-was-diplomatic-outcast-now-former-arab-adversaries-are-restoring-ties/?utm_term=.da0109a61404) other Arab states in restoring diplomatic ties with the Assad regime following the American withdrawal announcement.

In light of these developments, one has to ask: will we see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East in 2019?

Let's take these developments and put them into context. [As I have stated before](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9ozhcd/have_saudi_arabia_and_turkey_entered_a_cold_war/), much of Saudi Arabia's -- and by extension the Gulf states minus Qatar's -- recent foreign policy has been in response to Turkey's growing power and potential to threaten the traditional Saudi/Gulf state hegemony of the Sunni world in general and the Sunni world within the Middle East in particular. If Saudi Arabia wants to contain Turkey, the both the deployment of Saudi and Emirati troops into Northern Syria and the Kurdish/Gulf state efforts to reconcile with Assad would absolutely make sense.

And if Assad accepts these olive branches, that could change everything.

No, that's not an understatement.

In the aftermath of such a scenario, we must pay close attention to five countries:

1. **Turkey**. Relations between Turkey and much of the Arab world are already at an all-time low. Turkey's relationship with Syria and Egypt have completely collapsed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's support of anti-government movements in those countries. Meanwhile, tensions between Turkey and every Gulf state except Qatar have been growing for geopolitical (and to a lesser extent ideological) reasons. Turkey's relationship with Saudi Arabia in particular has deteriorated following the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. And then of course, there are the Kurds, no explanation needed there. A newly-found friendship between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds would likely make their relations with Turkey even worse, as the Turks sense a clear attempt at containment in Northern Syria.
2. **Iran.** Iran's relations with the Gulf states (especially Saudi Arabia but minus Qatar) are even worse than Turkey's relations with those countries.  For this reason, there is a good chance that the Iranian response to a reconciliation between Assad and the Gulf states will be harsher than the Turkish response. But how far will Iran go? If history indicates anything, all options appear to be on the table. Just over a year ago, former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was assassinated by his former (Iranian-backed) Houthi allies after he attempted to reconcile with the Gulf States in the midst of a civil war in his country. If Iran and/or its proxies could turn against and/or kill Saleh over his communications with the Gulf states, then they could do the same with Assad. Should they pursue that course of action, there can be only two outcomes. First, if Assad is killed or overthrown, that would likely make the war in Syria much, *much* worse. Not only could such an event start a new wave of uprisings, we could also see some of Assad's former allies within the country *joining* those uprisings over the issue of Syria's relationship with Iran. Alternatively, if Assad is *not* killed or overthrown, the Syrian-Iranian alliance would collapse. Syria would defect from the pro-Iranian camp to the pro-Saudi camp, while Iran would switch sides in the war -- and perhaps form an alliance with Turkey in the process.
3. **Russia.** If the Syrian-Iranian alliance collapsed, Russia would face a serious predicament. It would be forced to choose which ally is more strategically important: Syria or Iran. If Russia chooses Syria, then it gets to keep its naval base in Tartus and enjoy better relations with the Gulf states, but it also loses any clout it once had with Iran and Turkey to use against American influence in the region and perhaps faces a greater risk of terrorist attacks on its soil. If Russia chooses Iran, then it solidifies the ""Eurasian Alliance"" with Iran and Turkey against American influence in the region, but it also loses its naval base in Tartus and perhaps suffers its greatest humiliation on the international stage since the end of the Cold War.
4. **The United States.** If the outcome of the reconciliation between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds results in them moving closer to Russia, the United States could be very tempted to forge closer ties with Iran and Turkey to form a regional counterbalance. Should that happen, we could end up seeing Donald Trump doing a 180 on some of his current Middle East policies, such as opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and support of a Saudi-led ""Arab NATO.""
5. **Israel.** Israel's number one priority right now is Iran. If you're anti-Iran, you're the good guy, according to Israel. If Turkey, Russia, or the United States form closer ties with Iran as a result of the new re-alignment, odds are Israel's relations with those countries will seriously deteriorate in coming years.

[https://ecfr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine.pdf](https://ecfr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine.pdf)

>The countries surveyed were Poland and Romania – frontline, traditionally Russia-sceptic, states in central Europe; France, Germany, and Italy – large western European states that previously earned reputations as Russlandverstehers (“Russia understanders”); Portugal and Spain – southern European states that have in the past generally been less involved in Russia policy; Finland and Sweden – northern European states that are applying for NATO membership as a result of the invasion; and Great Britain.

Polled people where divided into three main groups. Peace, Justice and Swing voters.

>...clear divisions emerge in the poll when voters choose between whether Europe should seek to end the war as soon as possible – even if it means Ukraine making concessions \[Peace camp\] – or whether the most important goal is to punish Russia for its aggression and to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine – even if such a road leads to protracted conflict and more human suffering \[Justice Camp\].

&#x200B;

>While some pro-Russian (or anti-American) voters might be part of the Peace camp, this does not necessarily make the Peace camp a Russia-friendly grouping. While both Peace and Justice camps agree that Russia and Ukraine will each be worse off as a result of this war, the Justice camp believes Russia above all will be “much worse off”– while Peace camp members ~~Peace versus Justice: The coming European split over the war in Ukraine – ECFR/452 9~~ foresee that, of the two, Ukraine will suffer more. Some in the Peace camp may therefore want the war to end because they consider it is inflicting excessive suffering on Ukraine.

The peace camp amounts to about 35% of voters, justice 22%, swing voters 20% and rest 23% (Page 6). But numbers vary greatly in different countries. The biggest peace camps are in Italy (52%) and Germany (49%), while the justice camp amounts to 41% in Poland, who is a huge outlier, and 25% in Finland.

>The findings of the poll suggest that European public opinion is shifting, and that the toughest days may lie ahead. The resilience of European democracies will mostly depend on the capacity of governments to sustain public support for policies that will ultimately bring pain to different social groups. This will force governments to balance the pursuit of European unity behind pressure on Moscow with opinions that diverge both inside and among member states. The survey reveals a growing gap between the stated positions of many European governments and the public mood in their countries.

When asked who is mainly responsible for the outbreak of the war in Ukraine: Russia or any of Ukraine, EU or US the majority in all countries assigned the blame to Russia. Only Germany (66%), France (62%), Romania (58%) and Italy (56%) polled below 70%. In these four a substantial part of the population assign blame to Ukraine, EU, US (France 18%, Germany 20%, Romania 21% and Italy 27%). A median 12% either had no opinion or assigned blame somewhere else.

>War is like a rollercoaster: public opinion can change with every twist and turn, and it is also a hugely powerful driver. As Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times wrote recently, “The war in Ukraine is essentially being fought on three fronts and among three protagonists. The first front is the battlefield itself. The second front is economic. The third front is the battle of wills. The three participants are Russia, Ukraine and the western alliance backing Ukraine.

The challenge comes from swing voters (20% of the population), who are believed to be more likely to swing to the peace camp once their economic reality is under pressure, which might be felt fully come winter.

>While the Ukraine conflict could yet prove to be the midwife of a much more muscular EU, this research shows that support for increased defence spending is weaker among the public than it might appear if one were to listen only to political leaders.  
>  
>Perhaps the most worrying sign is that most Europeans see the EU as a major loser in the war, rather than reading its relative unity as a sign of a strengthening union.  
>  
>The danger remains that the Peace and Justice camps could yet become as polarised as the debtors and creditors in the euro crisis of the early 2010s. If this is allowed to happen – and if the EU becomes immobilised by its own divisions – then the war could signal the permanent marginalisation of Europe on the world stage.  
>  
>European public opinion fortified the EU’s unity in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is now up to Europe’s leaders to sustain this unity. Finding a language that appeals to the Swing voters – tough on Russia, but cautious about the dangers of escalation – could provide a way of squaring the circle of public opinion.

Apart from maybe Turkmenistan there is no Central Asian republic more despotic, or fractured than Tajikistan, so we took a look into where the country is going and why so many of Tajikistan's current problems were baked in the cake decades ago.

Tajikistan went through a pretty nasty civil war at the collapse of the Soviet Union, and has arguably never fully recovered from it with distrust and scars lasting to this day. Out of the chaos of the war rose their current leader Emomali Rahmon (who has been in power since 1992), and has ruled the country with an iron fist. His leadership has kept the republic stable, but poor; and his corruption has been staggering. To give an example; his official salary is just $13,000 USD but Rahmon is now one of the richest men in all of Central Asia with everything from luxury cars to lavish palaces. Rahmon has been taking major kickbacks in everything from the state Aluminum company to the Heroine trade coming out of Afghanistan, but how much longer will he likely be in power?  


However the main focus of the piece is around the new power dynamic forming in Tajikistan. The Tajik republic has been very much in the Russian sphere for a long time now, and even to this day over a third of the Tajik economy comes from remittances coming back from Tajik workers/laborers in Russia; Tajikistan is still very reliant on the Russian economy. Saying that though, more and more Chinese troops are being stationed in Tajik territory every month with Tajikistan now housing one of the largest contingents of Chinese troops outside of China. Beijing's claim is that these troops are there to protect Tajikistan and China from terrorism coming out of Afghanistan but the actual equipment and capabilities stationed in these Chinese bases would suggest otherwise. This may be China's military foothold into the region?   


I would love to get your opinion on the big question staring down Tajikistan at the moment, whether to move the country toward Beijing or stick the old masters in Moscow.

On the panel this week was >>

EUGENE CHAUSOVKEY -  (Centre for Global Policy)  
STANISLAV PRITCHIN - (ECED)  
ROBERT M CUTLER - (NATO Canada)   


Russia has been the dominant power on the sea for a very long time, but this has been in an era when nations like Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran weren't taking the potential of the Caspian seriously. The situation has changed and Turkmenistan particularly has a huge vested interest in the future here, as 300km of extra pipeline would connect the vast Gas fields of Turkmenistan to the hungry gas market in Europe. As we covered in the previous piece on Turkmenistan, there is enough gas under the surface here to take a big chunk of the EU gas market (something that would hurt Russia energy leverage). 

Russia seems to also be realising this threat as it is currently in the process of moving its major Caspian naval base from Astrakhan in the north of the Caspian, to Kaspiysk in Dagestan. Moving their fleet much closer to the potential pipeline sights, as well as the Azeri naval bases; it also may be a sign of Kremlins' worries about instability in Dagestan itself, but that is another piece for another time.   


All 5 Caspian nations seem to be awakening to the potential of the Sea, so what will be their next moves, and will Russia be able to hold onto their dominance in the area?

We also take a look into the Russians new Hypersonic missile program and whether this could pose a threat to the US reliance on its carrier fleet. 

For this episode we have  
MARLENE LAURELLE >> Director of the Central Asia Program and director of the PONARS think tank.  
STEPHANIE PEZARD >> Russian Arctic specialist for the RAND corporation.  
PAUL JOSEPHSON >> Author and professor of Russian technological history.  
ROB HUEBERT >> Russian defense expert and professor at the University of Calgary

One of the main focuses of the piece is about the slow opening of the Northeast passage, a shorter Arctic route between East Asia and Europe that is likely to become dominant in a few years. We ask the experts what this means for the balance of power, and if the US could protect their good as it goes through this new route. We also go through whether this development will give Russia the same leverage as Iran or Malaysia with their maritime checkpoints, and what it means for NATO.

Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know about the situation, and we learnt a lot making it.

We also decided to leave in some of the more controversial points this time, including the Russian Hypersonic Missile disasters and the Russian Skyfall program.

I'm interested to see how alongside being an economic/military superpower will China and Russia aim to dominate in shaping culture outside of their own borders and across the world the way the US has been able to do so. We can see this in the cultural behemoth that is Hollywood that is able to project American/Western ideals all across the globe through media. The massive success and huge demand of the American TV/film industry allows for American shows/films to be extremely sought after and therefore widely translated to be consumed by people everywhere. I like to think that the US was helped immensely by the fact that English is the lingua franca of the world, making it extremely easy to communicate with the global population unlike say, a Chinese film or a Russian TV show would be able to do so without the need for mass subbing/dubbing of each article of media and the demand to do so. There are also the media giants based in the US that operate everywhere, such as Netflix and Disney. How would China/Russia deal with this when their respective languages are not widely spoken outside of their own corners of the world?

Of course, American media is not alone, in that examples such as Japan's anime and South Korea's KPop industries are huge successes, but not at the level of the US's own TV/film/music industries. These two examples are limited to their own little groups/fandoms within a nation rather than consumption of the media nationwide.

What would a country need to do to become a cultural powerhouse with the ability to project its views through media to be consumed by the global population? Would they be forced to adopt English in their media to achieve this, or can it be achieved in their own respective language?

By the end I express the view that Assad's government has a chance of not surviving the next decades. 

It is becoming increasingly clear that Turkey plans to consolidate strategic control over Kurdish territories in Iraq and Syria, ensuring once and for all that Kurdish nationalism doesn't spill out into Turkey as it has done during the violent period of the Turkey-PKK war. Turkey is already rumored to have set up military infrastructure in the allied Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq. Same through the Syrian National Army and direct Turkish occupation in Syria. 
Turkey does not trust other governments to take care of the «Kurdish issue». Turkish policymakers remember how Hafez Al Assad allowed the PKK to set up camps in Syria in order to direct the Syrian Kurds attention from himself. Even the Kurdistan Regional Government, which is a Turkish ally, cannot keep the PKK out of it's own territory. Thus, I believe that Turkey will settle for nothing but direct control over those lands.

Additionally, Turkey views Assad/Alawite-dominated Syria as a source of instability and radicalization of Sunnis on it's doorstep. It considers a pro-Turkish, Islamist government in Damascus to be the key for stability in the Middle East. The rule of an Alawite minority Turkey sees as a death sentence for a stable Syria and constant source of future civil conflict. 

Thus, it would be logical to conclude that Turkey does not plan to ever leave Syria or abandon it's support for the Syrian National Army due to the points I listed above.


With the damage dealt to Russian internal stability and economy due to the invasion of Ukraine, demographic crisis and general decline, it is very likely that Russia will eventually end it's costly intervention and leave Assad, having far more important issues at home. 
The Syrian Arab Army without the backing of the Russian Air Force will not be considered a proper fighting force. It suffers from issues that will plague it as long as Assad is in power - corruption, low morale, sanctions affecting the quality and quantity of equipment. This means that without an external backer, Assad will not survive any serious Turkish offensive. 


With Russia out of the equation, the only state left that will be willing to support Assad is Iran. Syria serving as a crucial land link between Iran and Lebanon in any potential conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Iran will have to always maintain a friendly regime in Damascus. 
Iranian activities in Syria are estimated to be incredibly costly, and this is with Russia bearing a significant part of the financial burden, providing air support, modern SAM systems and other crucial aid. Soleimani was the one who invited Putin into Syria, and how Iran will be able to maintain it's presence there without Russia is not clear. 


This leads to the final question, comparing Iranian and Turkish military capabilities.

Iran's most threatening aircraft consist of old American jets left over from the Shah that the Islamic Republic has maintained using facilities built as part of Shah's contracts with American defense companies. Iran has no proper tank force, no specialized logistical vehicles that can withstand desert conditions, and lacks pretty much everything required for conventional warfare. This is why Iranian doctrine is reliant on asymetric warfare, but without Russian support this will not be an option in Syria. The Iranian ballistic missile arsenal is quite impressive, but attacks in the Turkish rear are out of the question due to Article 5 of NATO. 

On the opposite, Turkey is armed with advanced weaponry per NATO standards, fields an air force larger than France, a navy that will with ease blockade Syrian ports, and has an innovative domestic arms industry that will only continue to grow as time goes on. 


If we envision a future where Russia leaves Syria and Iran's presence in regime-controlled territory significantly weakens, won't it be very tempting for Turkey to fulfill the goals detailed in the beginning, solving the Kurdish «problem» and reshaping Syria into a somewhat stable state that won't cause problems for Turkey in the future? 

Theoretically, the open geography of Syria is favorable for swift armored maneuver as the Gulf War showed in identical conditions in Iraq. The majority of the Syrian population, Arab Sunnis, will probably be on the Turkish side. Israel will gladly provide intelligence and perhaps even military assistance. 

Of course, fully invading Syria will not be a cakewalk, as Turkey will have to confront Hezbollah and the IRGC, both potent fighting forces, but will this stop the Turks from securing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? Only time will tell. 

I will gladly listen to all comments disagreeing with my arguments.",geopolitics,Russia
224,Unanswered Questions on the Ukrainian-Russian War,307.0,uf5leq,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/uf5leq/unanswered_questions_on_the_ukrainianrussian_war/,211.0,1651301227.0,"Here are a few questions that I don't see being addressed much but should make for interesting discussion here:

* **What is Putin planning for the 1 million forcibly deported Ukrainian civilians?**
   * 1 million Ukrainians are estimated to have been forcibly deported from eastern Ukraine to eastern Russia.
   * The tactic does have some precedent in Soviet history but I suspect the strategy is different this time.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/04/02/russia-deportation-ukraine-baltics/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/04/02/russia-deportation-ukraine-baltics/)I'd be interested if anyone has any other precedents to point to.
   * There have already been reports of Russian offers to trade civilians for POWs.
   * This is potentially strong Russian leverage in peace talks. Is there anything Ukraine can do to counter this? Any sort of rescue operation seems out of the question given that Ukraine doesn't have a navy and that Russia's landmass is enormous.
* **Why is the Russian Naval force in the Black Sea still afloat?**
   * Everyone, including me, was surprised when Ukraine managed to take out the Moskva. Even more surprising is that by all accounts they managed to do so with their own missile technology (and a cheap drone distraction).
   * But now we are in a different phase. The western powers have made clear that they have no hesitation in handing Ukraine whatever weapons are available. And Turkey is enforcing an agreement that stipulates that warships cannot pass through the Turkish straits. Now no Russian naval ship can leave or enter the Black Sea.
   * So if you are a country like the US, UK, France, etc..., why not give Ukraine whatever stealth sub drones/stealth missiles you have that you think can take out Russian warships and let them loose in the Black Sea? For those countries/companies it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to test out their technology and eradicate an irreplaceable Russian fleet in the process.
   * Obviously you don't want that tech falling into the wrong hands, but frankly that should be manageable. Underwater tech is the easiest to self-destruct.
   * It may be that this will happen a month from now and it's only a matter of timing. It seems to me that this is not the occasion to be hesitant. And we've seen how severe a blow to Russian morale it was to lose a battleship.
* **Should Ukraine and the west offer a face-saving way out for Putin and if so, what could that be?**
   * The sanctions have considerably upped the ante on this war. Any resolution that does not include the relaxation of those sanctions will be a very tough pill for Russia to swallow. And I don't see the sanctions being relaxed as long as Russia continues to hold Ukrainian territory. At the same time, I can't see Russia declaring victory without holding any Ukrainian territory and I can't see Putin declaring defeat as it would very likely be his downfall.
   * So the question is -- is there something else that can be offered which would both allow a Russian declaration of victory and yet satisfy Ukraine and the west enough to end the war + sanctions? I can't come up with anything. Any ideas? If not, we may be looking at a very long conflict indeed.
   * The alternative is that Russia builds up leverage not just against Ukraine but against the West as well. They could for instance threaten to use Russian submarine attacks on cargo ships to block every major strait/western port. That would be extremely dangerous for Russia as their navy is heavily outmatched but perhaps there are some other similar moves I'm not considering. There is of course the scary possibility of building leverage through a demonstrated willingness to use tactical nukes/chemical weapons.
   * You could also answer that there is no possible resolution until Putin is replaced. But that is very dangerous for the world as well. Coups and instability in general in the world's second largest nuclear power are a terrifying possibility. A peaceful transfer of power supported by the population would be much, much safer. I don't like him either but thousands of loose nuclear weapons is something I dislike even more.
   * Really what we're asking here is, if Ukraine wants to fight on (and every indication is that they do), how can this war possibly end?
* **What is the demographic effect of this on Russia?**
   * Russia's demographics are already abysmal. ""In 2018, the total fertility rate across Russia was estimated to be 1.6 children born per woman"". And that was before Covid took a huge bite out of the population. Russian demographics have only been kept afloat in the last 20 years by immigrants. It has the third-largest immigrant population in the world (almost all from ex-Soviet States).
   * Now you have \~20-25,000 dead Russian 18-25 year old males (increasing with every day that this war continues) and you have hundreds of thousands - a million Russians who have emmigrated since the war has begun. [https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-russians-leaving-their-country/a-61364390](https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-russians-leaving-their-country/a-61364390).
   * Now the economy is suffering and millions of those immigrants who came to Russia for work are going to start going back. And the young native Russians fleeing the country are not just any Russians, they are the ones with the skills and education you most require to improve the economy long term. Now there are reports that Biden is going to waive visa requirements for highly educated Russians who want to move to the US. He won't be the last to do it. What happens when Putin declares that conscripts are going to start being sent to Ukraine as well? How many more will try to flee then?
   * I wouldn't be surprised if Russia tried to close its borders to stop emmigration a la the Soviet Union.
   * I should add that people often associate wars with population booms like the one that happened after WWII in the US. But I want to caution you not to have that expectation here. Not all wars are equal. Look at the figures after Vietnam, you will see the birthrate decline and stabilize, not increase. I wonder if population booms only come after major, *successful* wars? Wars that leave you thinking the world is now a better, safer place to raise children in? Regardless don't bank on that effect in Russia in the years to come.
* **Will any other countries see this as an opportunity to reclaim territory from Russia as well?**
   * With the Russian army looking both weak and thoroughly preoccupied at the moment, will any other countries be bold enough to jump on this chance? Japan just reestablished territorial claims on islands between Japan and Russia. Georgia has begun applying to join the EU. Moldova is increasingly nervous about Russian plans for Transnistria.
   * Let's say you are the Georgian or Moldovan government and you speak to Biden and discover that the US is willing to extend the terms of the lend-lease deal with Ukraine to you as well should you make your move now. And why not? Russia has taken your land as well, just like it has Ukraine's, and the US feels a bit hypocritical for not supporting you more then. Do you seize this opportunity? It's unlikely to come around again.
   * What about Chechens? Will they be tempted to rise up once more?
   * Russia has an incredible land mass. One that neither its population nor its economy can really support these days. Now there's blood in the water as well ...

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.


_________

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.

1. In the global warming world, Siberia will provide vast amounts of arable lands, so that China can finally become food sufficient.
2. All the natural resources therein that China needs: natural gas, oil, precious metals, even just the wood for logging and construction.
3. A port on the Arctic Sea: in the warming world, the Arctic Sea may become a year round warm water port. If this is true, then a port on the Arctic Sea will allow China to sling its shitty goods to the world for half the transportation costs, because 80% of the world lives in the Northern Hemisphere, and will allow China to skip the Western controlled Indian Ocean and east/western Pacific Rim.

The invasion is also much easier than an amphibious assault on Taiwan for the following reasons:

1. China has never amphibiously done anything. However, it has plenty of experience rushing across a land border and pushing to the end (Korea War, lesser extent Vietnamese War).
2. Russia's defenses and reinforcements can be crippled by merely shutting down a few railways, which China can decimate with its Rocket Force and hypersonic missiles.
3. The West is not going to help Russia resist China as much as it would help Taiwan, if it even offers Russia any aid at all.
4. China has causus belli, at least to Russia, for the same reasons that Russian justified its invasion of Ukraine. China actually has a stronger claim here, because the Asian populations in Siberia are much more friendly to their Chinese neighbors who they trade with than the Slav overlords in Moscow, that only pay attention to them when it needs warm bodies for some foreign European conflict. China can legitimately claim that it is liberating oppressed ethnic Chinese peoples from Russian oppression. Shit, to be funny, they could literally just parrot Putin's speeches in 2014 when he took Crimea.

Visit a news site from that country, then visit a news site from a rival country, and compare articles. From those two articles, you should be able to decipher a close approximation as to what really happened or what is going to happen. For example check out these two conflicting articles, the first composed by CNN (http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/17/world/europe/russia-pussy-riot-trial/index.html) and the second composed by Russia Today (http://rt.com/politics/russian-comment-riot-trial-941/). From the first article you get the impression that the world and all of Russia currently stands against Putin and the court decision to jail the feminist punk band ""Pussy Riot"". But upon reading the second article, which originates from Russia, you get a different picture: While many outside countries and indeed many within Russia believe the jailing of the band to be a human rights' violation, the actions of the band members that caused their imprisonment were so controversial (breaking into one of the most important religious buildings in Russia and protesting in a fairly raucous manner against religion and President Putin) that the Russian public is pretty well divided in the support for the band and in support of the government's jailing of them (mostly among religious lines). If ""Riot Grrrl"" or some other popular feminist band in America pulled a similar stunt in say, the Washington National Cathedral or the Basilica of the National Shrine, do you really think they wouldn't have been arrested by police and tried by the government? Do you really think our government would have let them go free without charge, especially now with the laws just passed that makes protesting a crime? I highly doubt it. And as far as the charge of Pussy Riot's sentence of 2 years in jail being ""disproportionate"" goes, I don't think the government has any room to talk considering they want to execute Julian Assange merely for publishing some harsh, revealing truths about our government that it desperately doesn't want you to find out about. So, does America really believe in free speech and protecting human rights more than Russia? Perhaps in the past, but now? Hardly. Don't get me wrong, I am a strong believer in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to protest and freedom to address the government with your list of grievances. I fully believe Pussy Riot's jailing to be a violation of these freedoms, and that their sentence of 2 years is highly disproportionate. I just think that the American government, in this case, is being highly hypocritical, and ought to follow their own damned advice for once.

I'm a citizen from a NATO country and absolutely denounce Putin's actions in this moment. However after seeing so many passionate Americans discussing this topic I urge you Americans to read this from every other country in NATO's perspective, as many of my European friends know most Americans are all brainwashed the same way:

Talking about the war in Ukraine yes Putin is evil, but extreme restraint has been shown towards inflicting civilian casualties - from the fact we saw that video of a single guy blocking tanks tienamin square-esque, the dude who punched a russian soldier in the face (just to not get punched or anything back but a warning shot into the ground) - the fact 2 of the missiles hitting apartment buildings had mapped trajedectories showing they were near-misses of actual military points of importance, etc are all in favor of the Ukranian people.

Putin's use of artillery has 99% so far been to barrage only military-entrenched positions (some of which sadly are amid civillians, so yes civilian life is being lost, but not targetted - the importance is the targetting of military assets) is something to note.

I hate Putin and hope Russia loses, but If he really wanted mass bloodshed, we'd see artillery barrages over every civillian point of interest to conflict collateral damage to get Ukraine to surrender. Also I come from a NATO country but let's be real here, USA intentionally went into middle-east knowing there were no WMDS and PURPOSELY targeted hospitals, schools, kindergardens etc for 'shock and awe'.

Once again fuck Putin, but atleast unlike the USA leaders, he shows restraint. I hope Ukraine\* wins, but I hope the USA sheeple come to understand just how much propaganda THEY consume (once again Im white and from a NATO country - just saying truths) and maybe wake up to the fact that the USA military is more willing to shed blood, than even the Russian military.

The only difference is the lens upon which the propaganda we're seeing is. Russia is invading Ukraine for oil (it's proven look it up srsly) just as USA invaded middle east for oil. The world is fucked. I wish the American people can come to respect middle-eastern civillian lives as much as Ukrainian lives. Anyways rant over, hoping the best for Ukraine.

To all of you Americans who are going to passionately defend and rationalize every which way killing 100,000+ innocent middle-eastern people PURELY in the pursuit of oil please sit and think to yourself - are you so racist you reckognize Ukranian people as humans but not middle-eastern people? Or are you too stupid and brainwashed to understand the USA government purposely destroys KINDERGARDENS and HOSPITALS to DESTABILIZE regions in the pursuit of oil, where as yes fuck Russia, but they are mostly focused on MILITARY targets, not ""shock and awe"" tactics.

By Chris Chandler

I believe that on Veteran's Day it is important to remember there are many ways to die in the service of your country.

I also believe that the second single most thing that America needs is... forgiveness. The only way she can receive that... is to deserve it.

This past election was hard for many. Some remain hopeful. Some are celebrating. Voting is important. I know many who disagree, for reasons left and right. To them I say, at least cast a blank ballot.

With that said, it is also important to keep in mind that it has not been voting that has brought us much needed change in this country. Most of the important gains we have made in this country has been through direct action. Marching in the streets. Rarely does a politician benevolently legislate positive change. It needs to be demanded by those in the street. Our Veterans. Yes, our veterans for Peace and Justice.

Today is Veteran’s Day. (Monday it is Observed)

I say, we should not only honor, remember, celebrate and lay wreaths upon the tombs of our fallen military veterans, but also our fallen veterans for peace and justice.

I can at least intellectually wrap my head around honor in serving your country. But, I also recognize (at least by odds) that inside Unknown Soldier's Tomb lay...
...a conscript.

I am aware of the naiveté of my pacifism.

Yes, The United States did do her part helping Russia and Great Britain to liberate Europe and China from brutal tyranny just sixty odd years ago.

But most of our military campaigns have been dubious at best.

Perhaps we did need to step in a century ago and mop up that awful squabble over the shifting powers of the newly industrialized European Corporations (I mean countries.)

Perhaps, Abe Lincoln was justified in raising troops and marching them against his rebelling people. (Though people much smarter than me have pondered that one for much longer than I have... could the slaves have been freed with out a war?)

But The War of 1812 – AKA the failed Canadian land grab
The Seminole Wars?
The Texas Revolution?
The Invasion of Mexico?
The Indian Wars of '65 to ' 90?
The Invasion of Cuba?
The Philippines?
Countless occupations in Central America?
(WTF do you think brought us the caravan?)
The Korean War?
Vietnam?
The Cold War?
Oil War I?
The Occupation of Afghanistan?
Oil War II?

How can we justify any of those?

Throughout human history poor people have been drafted to fight in rich people's fights. And I hate that.



Yes, on Veteran's Day, in my younger days I might have jumped up on a bar stool and decried all people willing to partake in warfare.

Then i think...

My ancestors fought in the Civil War. They were not land owners, let alone slave owners... They were drafted... in the first American conscription ever. Poor people fighting a rich man’s fight.

Today, I think of conscripts forced to fight. Economic conscripts caught between incarceration and Kandahar – Bankruptcy and Baghdad.

They are martyrs too.

They should be honored.

As Abraham Lincoln said, “It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.”

However, there are many ways to die in the service of your country. Many people in the United States have taken on many battles that are just, proper and good.

The fight for the 8 hour day.
The fight for child labor laws.
The fight for women's suffrage.
The fight for civil rights.
The anti war movement.
The fight for gay rights.
The fight for trans rights.
The Fight for Immigrants' Rights.
(to name a few.)

Not to mention
The war on Poverty
The War on Drugs...
The Drug on Wars....
The War on Christmas.
(It is November the 11th - stop it with the Christmas music already) is that a war?

No seriously, on this Veteran’s Day I remember not only our fallen Veterans of War, but I also remember Sacho and Vanzetti. Joe Hill, and John Brown. August Spies and Albert Parsons and the other Haymarket Martyrs.

I remember Rachel Corey. I remember Alison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Schroeder who were killed at Kent State. They are veterans who died in the service of their country.

I remember James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Henry Schwerner - young civil rights workers - who were arrested by a deputy sheriff and then released into the hands of Klansmen who had plotted their murders.

I remember Emily Davidson who in 1913 martyred herself in protest of women's right to vote.

No, I can't name them all. And there are countless activists that have died in the line of duty.

But still - on this day, I ask for a tomb of the unknown activist. I ask Donald J Trump on Veteran’s Day to lay a wreath in Utah where Joe Hill was killed by firing squad. ""Don't mourn. Organize,"" he said. (I can ask can’t I?)

On this Veteran’s Day I ask Melania Trump to lay a wreath for the victims of the hunger strikes of the Suffragettes. She could not have voted for her husband without them. They are veterans who died in the service of their country.

I remember “The Battle of the Viaduct.""

I remember Malcolm X. Though killed by people within his own cause, the institution of racism and the ""Hate that hate produced"" was the ultimate culprit in his demise. He was a veteran who died in the service of his country.

This list is far from complete. There is no way it could be. It is by no means all of them. But it is important we remember them all.

I am not an American

So I don't know much about american politics but some time back I posted a video of Tulsi gabbard saying that America and EU could have prevented this russia ukraine war from happening by saying that ukraine will never be a NATO member which is true the war wouldn't even start if ukraine didn't resist russia for joining NATO before the war and the funny part is after the war started they said that okay we will not join NATO

So this statement was given by Tulsi Gabbard on Fox news and I posted this video here :- [https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/hmmm/)

and Immediately people didn't even try to understand the point made by her and Immediately cancelled her with personal comments and saying that it is Fox news and I am thinking that so what ? how does it matter that the statement was given on fox news or on any other news channel the point made by her sounded very valid to me the only sensible comment I could find there was this [https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/comment/hz1njnv/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/comment/hz1njnv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So my question What is wrong with Fox news ? the only thing I know is that it is known to be Republican I think so but I could be totally wrong so please correct If I am .",Freethought,Russia
