Doesn't anyone ever wonder why there have been so few public trials over the last several decades considering how many people the government has accused of crime? Those the government accuses  usually end up executed, tortured, in black sites, or with max sentences.

And then the people who actually do commit the worst crimes and are tied to the government themselves like Epstein and Maxwell, end up with light sentences, in country club prisons, or simply ""commit suicide"" while the prison cameras conveniently broke, so you can't even confirm they died.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

3,An Open Letter to Everyone who has forever Mocked us Conspiracy Theorists,3377.0,conhke,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/conhke/an_open_letter_to_everyone_who_has_forever_mocked/,1397.0,1565470350.0,"You called us names. You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

I’ve seen a lot of people in this sub blast Rogan accusing him of being controlled opposition. Well, he’s truly been obliterating the Covid scam consistently for some time now.

From hosting numerous Drs and scientists questioning the vaccines or how the whole ordeal has been handled to curing his own case of Covid with Ivermectin, Vitamin D and Zinc. The guy has the biggest podcast on earth and has used his platform to call bullshit.

The media can’t stand him now. He’s censored on YouTube and Spotify constantly and publications that used to rave about his podcast are now ridiculing him relentlessly.

I always thought the guy was genuine. I’ve been a fan for a long time. So now more than ever, support this dude. If you’ve been one calling him an asset, it’s time to drop this nonsense and get behind him because his platform is massive and reaches a LOT of people that Fox or the Blaze cannot lol. Thank you for being real and exposing the shit to an audience that would typically not hear it Joe. Don’t stop dropping truth bombs. We need it now more than ever.

Edit: Seems many of you only appreciate someone speaking out of his name is Alex Jones. I didn’t realize everyone else was supposed to fuck off and disagree with us. My bad lol

Edit 2: Joe also credited monoclonal antibodies for his successful recovery. Apparently (unintentionally) not saying this in the OP has caused some here to have an aneurism. 

Let the record show. I don’t care if he is PRO VACCINE. That isn’t the point. At all. The point is that while sites like Twitter are now banning anyone who questions the vaccine or the CDC, Rogan is giving people on all sides a platform and letting them express their opinions in an open dialogue for 2-3 hours. And I appreciate the hell out of that. And if you can’t appreciate open dialogue then that doesn’t make you a better conspiracy theorist (which is odd to me that it’s even a competition for some of you) it just makes you closed minded and uncomfortable outside of your echo chamber.

3rd and FINAL edit: I’m done for the day kids. It’s my one day off this week and I’m going to go Christmas shopping for my niece and finish the night with a whisky and some Halo Infinite with my cat.

Word is coming out of Slovenia that, if verified, will cause an unimaginable world reaction.
On Saturday 20 November, the Chief Nurse of the University Medical Center, Ljubljana Clinical Center, who deals with the administration of vaccine vials and manages everything, quit her job, went in front of TV cameras and took out vaccine bottles.
She showed the gathered journalists the codes on the bottles, each with the final number 1, 2, or 3 in the code, and then explained the meaning of these numbers:
Number 1 is placebo, saline.
Number 2 is the classic mRNA ""vaccine""
Number 3 is an RNA stick containing the ONC gene, related to adenovirus, which contributes, among other things, to the development of cancer.
For these who get jabbed from vial whose code ends in the number 3, she says people who received them will have soft tissue cancer within 2 years.
She said that she had personally witnessed the vaccinations of all politicians and tycoons and that they all received the preparation number 1 
The media has been told to absolutely bury this story and fierce efforts at containing this information are underway right now.
More details if they become available.

Edit: I didn't write this. I copied and pasted from a text I received from a family member.  I really like how some people on here went and found video evidence of it being said by the nurse. Also someone found a news article.  I couldn't find anything about this before I posted it. This blew up so I'm going to go read all the comments.

Example. You claim the vaccine is a depopulation program. Those administering and supporting the vaccines can now say you are defaming them because ""antivaxxers"" are contacting them directly and calling them murderers.

So I fact checked him. Googled ""human pig hybrids.""

The CDC has nonscientifically widened its definition of ""vaccine"" to get the dubious covid shots under that umbrella.  They have widened the definition so much that now immune-enhancing vitamin preparations, herbal tinctures and extracts, and fruit preparations like elderberry syrup can now be called ""vaccines"" as they fall underneath the CDC's ridiculous new definition. 

Old definition:


**Vaccine:** 

>A product that stimulates a person’s immune system **to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.** Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.

**All of these media outlets are in on the game**

Rupert Murdoch who owns Fox News attends Bilderberg, as did Ted Turner (CNN). Both sides are played like a fiddle. 

Incase you didn't know, the left right paradigm is this archaic and ancient form of control over large masses of people. It is a trick that has been effective against humanity for ages, and it plays upon our primordial system. And it filters down into our media. Many people see it as ""FOX vs CNN""...but few know that Murdoch and Turner are friends. 

**TWO TEAMS. BLUE vs RED.**

It's a ""political football game"", that many people DEEPLY identify with, whose egos are intertwined within the party or ""team"" philosophies. This keeps us fighting each other, indefinitely, as the people who are *really* in control live their lavish lifestyles on top of our backs as we argue. 

I will admit, I was an Alex jones listener for some time. One of the biggest things I took away from his films and ramblings, was that this false dichotomy of ""dem vs rep"" was fake. Now, to see him blatantly abandon this principle and foundational conspiracy theorist conmandment, it is very obvious to me he is *leading* our movement towards a partisan right leaning.

**allow me to reiterate, both parties are corrupt to an equal extent. No one side is better than the other side. To believe that, is to fall prey to the trap.

Does anyone else remember how this all started? Forgive me for any timeline errors about this but Trust me worth the read.   I'd love to hear others opinions and discussion on the topics below.

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

[why is Alex Gatekeeping for CNP?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYl9iZlArjM) 

Well maybe because a little bit of research into them will take you from Rothschilds all the way to Trump.


Well first we can start with you see Jerome Corsi (Washington correspondent Infowars) is a member of [CNP](http://wariscrime.com/new/how-the-big-brother-controls-alternative-media/) - council for national policy. 

[As is Bannon.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.rawstory.com/2016/08/trump-campaign-ceo-and-manager-part-of-secret-extremist-right-wing-group-splc/amp/) Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. Breitbart was [founded by the Mercer family.](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years).
***


The Mercer family [are an old Rothschild proxy, very old money.](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Rothschild's_Bank_-_The_Best_Club_In_London)  
 Its a rarely discussed but very relevant fact that [Mercer was decisive in securing key positions for his long time family advisers ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit) - Kellyane Conway & Robert Bannon . In addition to working as assets on Mercer family projects, [Mercer had Conway organise the spending for Cruz's failed campaign.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-08-17/trump-s-new-team-brings-deep-ties-to-major-donor) . After which they changed their support to Trump. [The Mercer Foundation also happens to be the #1 financier of CNP](https://littlesis.org/org/37180/Council_for_National_Policy). [You may have seen Rebekah Mercer](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-11-11/rebekah-mercer-daughter-of-major-donor-named-to-trump-role) named as part of Trumps transition team.

***
150 CNP members recently signed a draft of an executive order, [to protect Religious Liberty](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.toddstarnes.com/column/conservatives-call-on-trump-to-protect-religious-liberty%3Fformat%3Damp) .

>>If signed it would create wholesale exemptions from a range of nondiscrimination laws and regulations “for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.” 

After 8, years of liberal policies from Obama, the introduction of such a bill is designed to cause extreme unrest and division. As is always the case- when we fight each other, we remain blissfully unaware of the hidden hands.

So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sadbuttrue)worlds most recognisable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities. [Alex has acknowledge his family worked in the CIA](http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Jones-CIA.htm).

***
None of this new however. If you've been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember [Wilbur Ross?](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story,amp.html). Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. 
At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he'd been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.

>>When asked why he'd made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving.
>>""“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.

The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer & Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have accquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House.

Here are a few concerns I have..

* Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.

When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; **""the trump name is still very much a future asset for us""...**

How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?

Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.

* After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The  point is, he lied to you, turned around, and ""got the band back  together"" so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Do you trust Jeff Sessions and John Bolton?

[https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments](https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments)

* Why did trump meet in private, and visit the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can anybody explain this? Are you OK with this and why?

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/)

* Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the ""terrorism boogeyman""  in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, ""bomb the  shit out of them and take the oil"". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?

Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did  he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?

[https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8YouTube](https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8)

* Why Is trump saying that the CIA is ""great"" and  ""terrific""? Why did he say that he was behind them ""1000&#37;""?

[https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cMYouTube](https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cM)

* Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of  US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?

Also, after criticizing Obama's policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?

Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump's.

* Finally after criticizing  Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips,  is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000  dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies?

These questions should be very easy for Trump supporters to explain. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB?

At the moment of me writing this im not entirely sure where this will go, but I think we can all agree that the world is completely fucked at the moment. I don't know if it was always the case throughout history, but one thing is certain - the greedy, manipulative and most power hungry people in the world are turning our beautiful mother Earth into their own personal sandbox playground with absolutely no fear of repercussions, and modern technology makes it easier than ever. 

I am 24, live in Kyiv, Ukraine, and as the mainstream media seems to point out, the world is on the constant verge of ww3 which can start at any moment via major escalation. I am personally in the first operational reserve of the army, as ex-military, along with 350,000 others. We have a 250,000 strong active army with 50,000 national guard, 120,000 territorial defense force and more than 900,000 men ready to be mobilized on top. And you're telling me Putin wants to attack us with 130,000 troops? I know he has nukes and tech superiority. Of course we are all nervous about it, and no one knows what will happen for sure, we can only prepare, but it seems like this serves as a great distraction from all the other shitshow that is going on, and it seems to me like the US wants this conflict the most by constantly bombarding everyone and everything with news that invasion is imminent. The constant negative news is crippling our economy without any invasion even happening. The richest oligarchs and some of the parliament members just flat out left the country, abandoning us. Just shows the type of people they are - make their money here and rule us, and leave when they are most needed. I am very proud of the Canadian truckers on that matter, that is what freedom fighters look like.

I am personally unvacced, but have the luxury since I work remotely. I don't want to turn this into a vaccine post, but I think by now we all now it is the worlds biggest scam, and hundred of millions of people have been forced to inject ""vaccines"" that weren't properly tested with unknown long term consequences, some of which are already becoming apparent, and suppressed. 

I've been into conspiracies for a while now. I enjoyed watching Alex Jones and Joe Rogan a lot, and I understand a lot of it seemed like crazy talk at the time, but considering how much of it turned out to be true, it gave me the mentality to question everything in my life, to seek truth, and to avoid being a mindless sheep the human race i slowly being turned into. Even based on what they put in our food, its evident they are dumbing down the ordinary folk, stopping the human race from its awakening and spiritual development. I do believe in the existence of ET's, and how we already have anti-gravity technology, know how to create free unlimited energy, and how it is all being suppressed for the sake of the oil/coal/gas corporations to maintain absolute control.  

It's a sad state of affairs. Our technology is advancing very rapidly, but our spiritual side is far behind. Materialism is being shoved down our throats like it some kind of universal truth, but there is so much more to life and who we really are than many people can imagine. We are being lied to and manipulated by the ultra wealthy and powerful every day, and at this point, I don't entirely understand how ordinary people can bring this system down, if at all. 

As bad as everything is, I still have hope for humanity and a better future. I know that love is what will save us all in the end, and it's the only way forward if humanity wishes to become a true cosmic civilization. The Lord of the Rings is my favorite movie trilogy of all time, and while a lot of the quotes there are beautiful, one stands out to me: 

Frodo : I can’t do this, Sam.

Sam : I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are.   
It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  
Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end.  
Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. 

But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass.  
A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something.

Frodo : What are we holding on to, Sam?

Sam : That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

75,Exclusive: FBI document warns conspiracy theories are a new domestic terrorism threat,574.0,ckqppi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ckqppi/exclusive_fbi_document_warns_conspiracy_theories/,311.0,1564677210.0,"https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html

----------------------------------

The FBI for the first time has identified fringe conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat, according to a previously unpublicized document obtained by Yahoo News. (Read the document below.)

The FBI intelligence bulletin from the bureau’s Phoenix field office, dated May 30, 2019, describes “conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists,” as a growing threat, and notes that it is the first such report to do so. It lists a number of arrests, including some that haven’t been publicized, related to violent incidents motivated by fringe beliefs.

The document specifically mentions QAnon, a shadowy network that believes in a deep state conspiracy against President Trump, and Pizzagate, the theory that a pedophile ring including Clinton associates was being run out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant (which didn’t actually have a basement).

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document states. It also goes on to say the FBI believes conspiracy theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential election cycle.

The FBI said another factor driving the intensity of this threat is “the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups involving illegal, harmful, or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures.” The FBI does not specify which political leaders or which cover-ups it was referring to.

President Trump is mentioned by name briefly in the latest FBI document, which notes that the origins of QAnon is the conspiratorial belief that “Q,” allegedly a government official, “posts classified information online to reveal a covert effort, led by President Trump, to dismantle a conspiracy involving ‘deep state’ actors and global elites allegedly engaged in an international child sex trafficking ring.”

This recent intelligence bulletin comes as the FBI is facing pressure to explain who it considers an extremist, and how the government prosecutes domestic terrorists. In recent weeks the FBI director has addressed domestic terrorism multiple times but did not publicly mention this new conspiracy theorist threat.

The FBI is already under fire for its approach to domestic extremism. In a contentious hearing last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray faced criticism from Democrats who said the bureau was not focusing enough on white supremacist violence. “The term ‘white supremacist,’ ‘white nationalist’ is not included in your statement to the committee when you talk about threats to America,” Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said. “There is a reference to racism, which I think probably was meant to include that, but nothing more specific.”

Wray told lawmakers the FBI had done away with separate categories for black identity extremists and white supremacists, and said the bureau was instead now focusing on “racially motivated” violence. But he added, “I will say that a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.”

The FBI had faced mounting criticism for the term “black identity extremists,” after its use was revealed by Foreign Policy magazine in 2017. Critics pointed out that the term was an FBI invention based solely on race, since no group or even any specific individuals actually identify as black identity extremists.

In May, Michael C. McGarrity, the FBI’s assistant director of the counterterrorism division, told Congress the bureau now “classifies domestic terrorism threats into four main categories: racially motivated violent extremism, anti-government/anti-authority extremism, animal rights/environmental extremism, and abortion extremism,” a term the bureau uses to classify both pro-choice and anti-abortion extremists.

The new focus on conspiracy theorists appears to fall under the broader category of anti-government extremism. “This is the first FBI product examining the threat from conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists and provides a baseline for future intelligence products,” the document states.

The new category is different in that it focuses not on racial motivations, but on violence based specifically on beliefs that, in the words of the FBI document, “attempt to explain events or circumstances as the result of a group of actors working in secret to benefit themselves at the expense of others” and are “usually at odds with official or prevailing explanations of events.”

The FBI acknowledges conspiracy theory-driven violence is not new, but says it’s gotten worse with advances in technology combined with an increasingly partisan political landscape in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. “The advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access,” the document says.

The bulletin says it is intended to provide guidance and “inform discussions within law enforcement as they relate to potentially harmful conspiracy theories and domestic extremism.”

The FBI Phoenix field office referred Yahoo News to the bureau’s national press office, which provided a written statement.

“While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve,” the FBI said.

In its statement, the FBI also said it can “never initiate an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity. As with all of our investigations, the FBI can never monitor a website or a social media platform without probable cause.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which has also been involved in monitoring domestic extremism, did not return or acknowledge emails and phone requests for comment.

While not all conspiracy theories are deadly, those identified in the FBI’s 15-page report led to either attempted or successfully carried-out violent attacks. For example, the Pizzagate conspiracy led a 28-year-old man to invade a Washington, D.C., restaurant to rescue the children he believed were being kept there, and fire an assault-style weapon inside.

The FBI document also cites an unnamed California man who was arrested on Dec. 19, 2018, after being found with what appeared to be bomb-making materials in his car. The man allegedly was planning “blow up a satanic temple monument” in the Capitol rotunda in Springfield, Ill., to “make Americans aware of Pizzagate and the New World Order, who were dismantling society,” the document says.

Historian David Garrow, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Martin Luther King Jr. who has worked extensively with FBI archives, raised doubts to Yahoo News about the memo. He says the FBI’s default assumption is that violence is motivated by ideological beliefs rather than mental illness. “The guy who shot up the pizza place in D.C.: Do we think of him as a right-wing activist, or insane?” Garrow asked.

Garrow was similarly critical of the FBI’s use of the term “black identity extremists” and related attempts to ascribe incidents like the 2016 shooting of six police officers in Baton Rouge, La., to black radicalism. He said the shooter, Gavin Long, had a history of mental health problems. “The bureau’s presumption — the mindset — is to see ideological motives where most of the rest of us see individual nuttiness,” he said.

Identifying conspiracy theories as a threat could be a political lightning rod, since President Trump has been accused of promulgating some of them, with his frequent references to a deep state and his praise in 2015 for Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy site InfoWars. While the FBI intelligence bulletin does not mention Jones or InfoWars by name, it does mention some of the conspiracy theories frequently associated with the far-right radio host, in particular the concept of the New World Order.

Jones claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which 26 children were killed, was a hoax, a false flag operation intended as a pretext for the government to seize or outlaw firearms. The families of a number of victims have sued Jones for defamation, saying his conspiracy-mongering contributed to death threats and online abuse they have received.

While Trump has never endorsed Sandy Hook denialism, he was almost up until the 2016 election the most high-profile promoter of the birther conspiracy that claimed former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. He later dropped his claim, and deflected criticism by pointing the finger at Hillary Clinton. He said her campaign had given birth to the conspiracy, and Trump “finished it.”

There is no evidence that Clinton started the birther conspiracy.

I want to remind everyone that there is still a lot of odd shit around Sandy Hook.

Including but limited to:

* law enforcement parked 1/4 mile away upon arrival. Why didn’t they rush to the heart-wrenching emergency if it really occurred?
* no trauma helicopters were ordered. This is unheard of for an actual emergency.
* no paramedics were allowed in the school. This is unheard of.
* officials refuse to say who declared all 26 people dead. By law, this must come from a doctor. This refusal of so much basic information indicates lies and cover-ups.
* official narrative claims emergency personnel didn’t find the school secretary and nurse after 4 hours of searching. this “event” included a traffic sign lit with the message, “everyone must sign in.” Officials refuse any comment on this element that would be present for a staged \* event/drill. porta potties were on site; again with no comment by officials and consistent with holding a drill.
* no names were listed for the 26 children and chorus director at the 2013 Super Bowl event in honor of Sandy Hook. The children resemble the alleged shooting victims. It’s unimaginable to not list these names for such a huge deal.
* no lawsuits filed by parents for negligence against school district. This is unheard of.
* a shooter with Aspergers would have poor motor skills and muscle tone – how did he carry all the gear and shoot with such precision?
* Newtown Public Schools refused to return calls regarding safety procedures. Non-cooperation to contribute information for other schools’ safety is unheard of.
* the FBI classified the report on Sandy Hook. This has never been done before, and indicates a cover-up of all the evidence that this was a staged event.
* radio transmissions are consistent in tone and content for a drill, not an actual emergency.
* multiple weapons reported at a limited crime scene were never found. This is not credible.
* law enforcement sent a kindergarten girl from the hall to stay at the crime scene of room 8 to be alone with dead bodies. This is a ridiculous claim that demands investigation and answers.
* no parents viewed the bodies of their children. This is also unheard of.
* no documents are being released via Freedom of Information Act requests. This is unheard of.
* trauma services were never requested. This would never occur.
* tearing down the school is consistent with destruction of evidence, given the HUGE gaps between official accounts and the evidence. there’s zero evidence that a bio-hazard company was contacted to clean blood, bodily fluids, and officials refuse comment. This is impossible.
* Inquiries of who installed the school security system has been met with total silence. This is unheard of to not get this information to improve other schools.
* Absolutely bizarre characters/almost too obvious acting:

- over 140,000 instances of naturalnews.com have been purged from Google.com search engine

- His other websites he owns, like censored.news still appear, and his search engine, good gopher, both still show up when you type them into google.

- Typing in ""NaturalNews.com"" on Google only brings up his Facebook, and other instances, mostly websites attacking Mike Adams, as well as bogus advertisement websites (like natural.news as seen in my photo linked above)

- According to Mike, he was threatened recently (2-16-2017) to run a ""smear campaign"" against Alex Jones and his website, InfoWars.com

- Mike refused, and went public with this threat on his website which you can see linked here

- Now, as of today, Google purged all his instances and search terms off Google search engine (except his other websites, Facebook, etc)

- Mainstream media do not like Mike Adams (his nickname is the Health Ranger) because he is on Team Trump (even though he doesn't post many political articles)

- Big Pharma do not like him because he his anti Mercury/Thimersol in vaccines, and goes on about the other dangers of some medications etc

- Monsanto and the like do not like him because he does a lot of work and research on the dangers of GMO's

- Mike Adams has done a lot of great work for his fellow man. He tested water samples for free in cities across the nation after the flint water crises (which is still happening by the way)

- He is offering to do free water sample testing of Native American lands close to Oil Pipelines

Everyone can have their opinions on Mike Adams. Opinions don't matter right now.

What matters is Google took censorship into their own hands and purged information like this, which sets a scary and dangerous precedent.

To me, it seems as if the elite chose him as a populist to appeal to theorists and subvert our effectiveness as the truth movement.  We are  traditionally skeptical of politicians, especially the presidency.

It seems as if the trust for Trump spread once the ""alternative media""  started to endorse him. Alex jones, PJW, cernovich,ect. Couldn't these  guys be gatekeepers that ""flipped"" on us? Our culture is being sucked into the partisan vaccum.

Here are a few concerns I have..

* Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.

When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; **""the trump name is still very much a future asset for us""...**

How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?

Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.

* Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the ""terrorism boogeyman""  in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, ""bomb the  shit out of them and take the oil"". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?

Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did  he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?

The Trump administration (which is filled with members of the CFR, Bilderberg, and Rothschild assets) has also imposed gun right restrictions, such as a federal ban on bump stocks. Trump was hailed by his base as a pro 2A president. Trump also bragged about subverting due process to “take the guns first” and impose further restrictions.

**”Take the guns first, go through due process second,""**

**Trump has also expressed support for Dianne Feisntein’s assault weapons ban** and stated he would support an age restriction or a full on ban. Further proof that democrats and republicans work together to fuck the American people.

Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump's.

* After criticizing  Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips,  is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000  dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies?

Finally, on top of *ALL* of this, he has placed a myriad of CFR members, Bilderberg committee members, Goldman Sachs crooks, and Rothschild assets into positions within his cabinet. Why would an anti NWO president do this?

I would like to share a personal story: In the 90 the parents of a friend bought their first personal computer. At the time it was seen as a novelty and because I was ""the geek"" they naturally asked me to help them set it up.

After everything was installed we had a quick discussion and h\*l\* f\*\*\* they were deep into conspiracy stuff. This was my first encounter with someone believing it. They  started to ask me all kind of weird questions. Like if it was possible for the government to listen to what they were saying in front of the machine, or if they could access their files and what was written in the text processor.

Now I was a stupid teenager, and I remember thinking they must be a bit ""\*\*\*\*\*"" and laughing. I dismissed their concern, tried to explain how it worked but to no avail. It went down the rabbit hole of the TV manipulating you, the moon landing and chem trails (who remember those :P). Back home out of curiosity I went on the Internet and OMG I found so many cool, crazy stuff like crop circles, weird alien conspiracies and other stuff. It was entertaining more than anything else.

Since then I kind always kept reading conspiracies mainly for fun, listening to coast to coast night show or Alex Jones renting about random things. **I remember him talking about how TV was fogging your mind, and once you see through it you could be free.** Every time I would read about those conspiracies I was thinking how can people believe this weird stuff. It doesn't make any sense. This went on until recently. **However slowly around me the world was changing**.

First I started to notice how much harder it became to search for authentic conspiracy theory websites. What used to be handmade blogs and forums now became almost impossible to find on Google or moved to walled garden like Facebook. This is when I realize there was a silent censorship campaign going on. No one cared, those are fringe ideas, however like a canary in a coal mine if we start censoring this, what is coming next? The Internet became more and more sanitized, void of what made it amazing at the start.

Fast forward in early 2020 when I started to share my concern about the pandemic in China, after they started to lock down and the fact that there is a f\*\*\* \* virology research lab dedicated to coronavirus in the middle of the city, I was placed into the category of crazy conspiracy trump supporter. **In a bitter twist, me who was laughing and all of those crazy people I finally joined them.**

Today, I'm not laughing anymore, so many of those crazy conspiracies are not even conspiracy anymore:

* Anything you write / do on a computer can and will be recorded.
* Almost all apps will record data and send it to some random cloud to be analyzed.
* Your human experience, emotion is constantly tracked by behavioral algorithm trying to predict what you are going to do next and try to sell you more stuff.
* Your health and some of your most private information is sold as if it was another commodity.
* You have 0 expectation of privacy on all major internet platforms. Almost all of them are US based (except in China which has its own issues regarding privacy).
* The mainstream media is lying almost on a daily basis. There is almost no true investigation journalism done anymore.
* Yes Alex Jones was right (I can't believe I'm writing this). TV makes you stupid.
* This was especially obvious during the pandemic and once you see through it you realized how f\*ck\*d up this whole thing is.

Recently after expressing some concern about the COVID vaccine (btw what is crazy is I'm pro vax for most other vaccine and even got some unusual ones due to my travels), I'm now put into the category of Antivaxxer.

In short in a bit more than a year and half I became labeled as:

* Trump supporter (Because I supported from beginning a full investigation on the Wuhan lab).
* Racist (I do not support CRT and got into mild trouble at my work for that).
* Doomsday Prepper (Because I bought some food in case of lockdown)
* Antivax (By just mentioning we should not vaccinate younger adult teens and children before knowing more about side effects).

**It is so scary how easily the world can change around you and suddenly you find yourself on the other side of the fence.** I'm also amazed by how easily people are manipulated, this really opened my mind, people love to think they would be part of the resistance against the totalitarian gov while in reality they would most likely support it.

The fact that people are cheering mandatory experimental vaccines is so wrong on so many levels and to be honest the future scares me.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

Yes, the same Megyn Kelly who defended James Alefantis on fox during his interview...

When I was on this sub as a previous user, /u/djklbd, I had been calling out Trump as a puppet of the establishment for months leading up to the election. Evidence of this can be found in my post history on that account. I believe this election was part of a much bigger, and more sinister scheme than simply just securing another puppet for the next 4 years. 

This election helps contribute to several things; **ramping up the racial tension/sexual division in the US, and subverting the resistance movement, chief among them.**


It appears to me, that for TPTB to deal with  the fast growing ""conspiracy and alternative thinking culture"", they need to ""suck"" or ""pull us into"" the left/right paradigm somehow, to remove our effectiveness as opposition to their method of control. 

**We are KNOWN for criticizing this paradigm of control**. Now more than ever, it needs a group of serious, non-political critics: US, conspiracy theorists and alternative thinkers. 

The establishment knows that people are starting to question this rigged two party system, and the non partisan appeal of our sub/community is dangerous to them.

They are using Alex Jones and other alternative media figures, to ""lead"" us and merge us incrementally with partisan  politics, specifically REPUBLICAN and RIGHT-pro trump politics.

**What's up with all the CNN (the liberal outlet) bashing always on the front page,  but everyone thinks FOX (the republican outlet) news are saints? By design...**

Alex and **the shills on this sub know this plot**. This election was designed to make Trump look like an ""outsider"" to us, as if he beat crooked Hillary and defeated the globalists! (Bullshit...)

This scheme the social engineers and elite dreamt up, is to subvert our effectiveness as a resistance to their tyranny. 

**""If we can SUCK the alternative media culture into slowly endorsing right partisan politics and trust for our puppet president, our biggest critics (conspiracy theorists), become our allies and gatekeepers of our puppet!""**

This is fucking Happening folks. Let's stop bullshitting ourselves. This is EXACTLY what you see on this sub too. Their little social experiment seems to be working, however I sill believe much of the ""organic"" trump support you see on THIS sub in particular is manufactured by shills to prop up this little charade the social engineers came up with. 

Alex Jones is their pied piper leading us into the grinder. I Don't trust him 100% anymore. 


**Last E**: The Russia Conspiracy seems to be a ""cloak"" or ""sheild"" the social engineers and MSM generated, that Trump has against criticism from conspiracy theorists. Just because I don't believe in the Russia BS, DOESN'T mean i don't think the administration isn't up to the usual New World Order criminal mafia bullshit the last 5 puppet presidents were subservient to. 

They want to make us chase the DNC crimes, while this ""blatant russia conspiracy with tons of so called evidence"" passes us by, just to make us appear partisan. I know we are just following the leaks and pursuing what we have evidence for which happens to be DNC crimes, and we do a damn good job. However, be open to the possibility that this makes us appear partisan. This is why you see a lot of ""you guys are just TD 2.0!! Comments.

It could be a trick. Seth is the leaker and Russia conspiracy is fake we can all agree, I don't think they're plotting with Russia. Instead I think they're up to the same ""business as usual"" Henry Kissinger/Saudi/Israel NWO led criminal global government bullshit, and **""Russia"" is like a little ""sheild"" they can use against legit criticisms of their administration.**

""I think Trump is a New world Order asset""

""Oh, you must be peddling Russian BS!""

It's a way of having conspiracy theorists keep each other in line, protecting their little puppet. This can't last forever, eventually hes going to do something that stomps on the constitution and he will be exposed. But the MSM JUST keeps fucking talking about it 24/7 and breathing all this life into it...That's how I can tell it's probably horseshit, they are using it for *something*. Odds are it is not going to benefit us lol...

The purpose of these Agents Smiths are to:

1. Make conspiracies and theorists aka truth seekers look dumb ie ""so you think \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?""; usually an extremely weak argument logically or attacking the user not argument
2. Misdirect people ie through fake conspiracies like ""no one died in las vegas""
3. Frustrate posters\\thinkers
4. Make legit posters\\thinkers leave via the above and things like #10
5. Push agendas
6. Make us fight against each other ie dems vs reps, trump vs biden, christians vs muslims, progressive\\liberal, left\\right, it's all China, West\\East (scapegoating when it's really two heads of the same beast) - divide and conquer
7. Make legit people like Kanye, Russell Brand seem like they're in on it ie ""so you think a millionaire will help us plebs?"" (this ties into #8: hopelessness)
8. Spew hopelessness and hate  ie that"" whistleblower is going to die"" or ""well we can't do anything about it"" or ""people are so dumb""
9. Make us passive ie ""God\\Jesus will protect us"", ""Q\\Trump will drain the swamp"", ""looking forward until the timeline changes""
10. Spread degeneration and perversion ie look at her milk jugs or something about penis
11. Traumatize\\frustrate\\scare new\\curious people - running them out of here, away from researching or discussing topics.

This list goes on and on but it's a very sophisticated tactic and it is important not to be programmed by them. Don't let bullshit comments invoke any anger or frustration.  Don't scroll too quickly only to find a comment that hits your confirmation bias and makes you lean the wrong way. IE when reading a post about the dangers of fluoride, one of these agents will post a comment that says ""Well, children shouldn't be swallowing toothpaste anyway so this is stupid."" If you're already overwhelmed by the thought of a new world order out to get you, a comment like this is exactly what you're subconscious wants... to flee instead of fight.

Sort posts by new, comments by top. Read them all, even the negative ones. Before fully mentally shelving a users comment or agreeing with their stance, check their history. Anyone with over 50k - 100k karma is pretty suspect since legit posts that will enlighten the masses will be purposely downvoted. If they post multiple times every 10 minutes, another HUGE red flag. Skim through a couple comments, do they seem like a nice person. Do they post on insightful subs? If they comment on sexual subs, thats usually a big red flag too. Lots of these accounts will post on very niche subs to make it seem like they're just real people who are interested in paintball guns or cameras or fountain pens. If they post on spiritual forums, and seem like they're trying to help others, thats a HUGE GREEN one! - unless they post constantly post bullshit about demons or sex.

Also next time you post or comment and the votes seem to be stuck at 0. Leave the post\\comment on the active tab and hit refresh (f5 or swipe down on an app like RIF) - multiple times a second. You'll notice it go up to 1 or 2 and then back to 0. If it's really good, it'll hit the 7-8-9s on the brink of hitting the next denominator of 10 and then drop back to 7-8-9 again. But do not despair! The reason why they do this is to make us feel hopeless. Trust that people like me and others that know how all of this works actually do see and read your posts and comments even though the manipulated statistics don't reflect that.

Never forget... Elgin Air Force Base (population < 2,300) was ranked as the #1 ""Reddit addicted city""

\[[https://archive.is/BSFd6](https://archive.is/BSFd6)\]([https://archive.is/BSFd6](https://archive.is/BSFd6))

Elgin AFB is also where they conducted this study:

\[[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/air-force-research-how-to-use-social-media-to-control-people-like-drones/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/air-force-research-how-to-use-social-media-to-control-people-like-drones/)\]

Facebook isn’t the only organization conducting research into how attitudes are affected by social media. The Department of Defense has invested millions of dollars over the past few years investigating social media, social networks, and how information spreads across them. While Facebook and Cornell University researchers manipulated what individuals saw in their social media streams, military-funded research—including projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Social Media in Strategic Communications (SMISC) program—has looked primarily into how messages from influential members of social networks propagate.

One study, funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), has gone a step further. “A less investigated problem is once you’ve identified the network, how do you manipulate it toward an end,” said Warren Dixon, a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering and director of the University of Florida’s Nonlinear Controls and *Robotics research group*. Dixon was the principal investigator on an Air Force Research Laboratory-funded project, which published its findings in February in a paper entitled *“Containment Control for a Social Network with State-Dependent Connectivity.”*

The research demonstrates that the mathematical *principles used to control groups of autonomous robots can be applied to social networks in order to control human behavior.* If properly calibrated, the mathematical models developed by Dixon and his fellow researchers could be *used to sway the opinion of social networks toward a desired set of behaviors* perhaps in concert with some of the social media “effects” cyber-weaponry developed by the NSA and its British counterpart, GCHQ.

DARPA launched its SMISC program in 2011 to examine ways social networks could be used for propaganda and what broadly falls under the euphemistic title of Military Information Support Operations (MISO), formerly known as psychological operations. Early in July, DARPA published a list of research projects funded by the SMISC program. They included studies that analyzed the Twitter followings of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber among others; investigations into the spread of Internet memes; a study by the Georgia Tech Research Institute into automatically identifying deceptive content in social media with linguistic cues; and ""Modeling User Attitude toward Controversial Topics in Online Social Media”—an IBM Research study that tapped into Twitter feeds to track responses to topics like “fracking” for natural gas.

The AFRL-sponsored research by Dixon, Zhen Kan, and Justin Klotz of University of Florida NCR group and Eduardo L. Pasiliao of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate at *Eglin Air Force Base* was prompted by a meeting Dixon attended while preparing a “think piece” for the Defense Science Study Group. “I heard a presentation by a computer scientist about examining behaviors of people based on social data. The language that was being used to mathematically describe the interactions \\\[between people and products\\\] was the same language we use in controlling groups of autonomous vehicles.”

The social drone graph

That language was Graph theory—the mathematical language that is the basis of Facebook’s Graph database and the “entity” databases at the heart of Google and Bing’s understanding of context around searches. It’s also become a fundamental part of \*\*control systems for directing swarms of autonomous robots\*\*. The connection inspired Dixon to want to investigate the connection further, he said. *“Can you apply the same math to controlling autonomous people to groups of people?”*

Dixon’s group had been doing other work for AFRL around robotics, and when he mentioned the idea to a contact there, he was connected with researchers within the same group at AFRL who were interested in social media topics. With funding in hand, the research team worked to model how collaboration between “key influencers” in social networks could affect the behavior of groups within the network by using the *principle of “containment control.”*

Dixon explained the concept this way: “There’s a group of leaders, each of which has their own objectives, and they have their own topic of emphasis. The goal is to have those people change the opinion or coerce the group of followers—people \\\[who are\\\] in the social group of these people but don’t know the high level objective.”

**Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism**

GCHQ’s “Chinese menu” of tools spreads disinformation across Internet “Effects capabilities” allow analysts to twist truth subtly or spam relentlessly.

\[[https://archive.ph/G8NKZ#selection-701.0-705.266](https://archive.ph/G8NKZ#selection-701.0-705.266)\]

What appears to be an internal Wiki page detailing the cyber-weaponry used by the British spy agency GCHQ was published today by Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept. The page, taken from the documents obtained by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, lists dozens of tools used by GCHQ to target individuals and their computing devices, spread disinformation posing as others, and “shape” opinion and information available online.

*They built bots and “sockpuppets” – fake social media accounts* to make topics trend and appear more popular than they were – and swarmed together to overwhelm their targets. *They started to reach through computers to change what people saw, and perhaps even what people thought.* They celebrated each of their victories with a deluge of memes.

The lulz were quickly seized upon by others for the money. Throughout the 2000s, small PR firms, political communications consultancies, and darknet markets all began to peddle the tactics and techniques pioneered on 4chan. “Digital media-savvy merchants are weaponising their knowledge of commercial social media manipulation services,” a cybersecurity researcher who tracks this kind of illicit commercial activity tells me on condition of anonymity.

“It’s like an assembly line,” he continues. “They prepare the campaign, penetrate the target audience, maintain the operation, and then they strategically disengage. It is only going to get bigger.”

A range of websites started selling fake accounts, described, categorised and priced almost like wine: from cheap plonk all the way to seasoned vintages. The “HUGE MEGA BOT PACK”, available for just $3 on the darknet, allowed you to \*\*build your own bot army\*\* across hundreds of social media platforms. There were services for manipulating search engine results. You could buy Wikipedia edits. You could rent fake IP addresses to make it look like your accounts came from all over the world. And at the top of the market were *“legend farms”, firms running tens of thousands of unique identities, each one with multiple accounts on social media, a unique IP address, its own internet address, even its own personality, interests and writing style.*

**EDIT:**

Not only are they spreading disinformation and manufacturing consent, they also spread pervertism and obscenity to degrade and morally corrupt society. If one looks at the history of a lot of these bots, especially the ones with crude names like LongDongBob or ThiccBoy69 (i made those up) they consistently post and comment about sexual, and homosexual things like random comments about H. Bidens privates that contributes absolutely nothing to the discussion. Extremely damaging to impressionable YA that think real people think that way.

**EDIT2:**

Re: ""With funding in hand, the research team worked to model how collaboration between “key influencers” in social networks could affect the behavior of groups within the network by using the principle of “containment control.”""

That is exactly what Q was created for. Containment control. Same with Alex Jones - mixing a little truth to make things look real.

Look how ridiculous Alex Jones' segment on Ivermectin is. He's essentially teeing himself up to be ridiculed so folks like Kimmel can clown on him and make truth seekers look insane.

**EDIT 3 (new thread):**

The top subs are all heavily censored and botted. politics, technology, parenting, whatever... they're ALL programming centers. Any comments that start with ""Well, I'm a doctor, lawyer, mother of 5...."" is bullshit, used to skew public perception to their advantage. Stay away from this subs, dont comment on them, don't read anything on them. They will do more harm than good, no different than looking up news from the MSM.

**EDIT 4 (new thread):**

Almost forgot.... be weary of bots that are purposely programmed to interact with other bots. For example...

Bot 1: Wait, but how can flouride be so bad if it's in all tooth pastes? My doctor even said it was important.

Bot 2: I've studied this for over a decade. Flouride IS important, my brother is a dentist.

Bot 1: OMG, thank you so much for clearning that up. I was starting to worry for no reason!

Bot 2: No welcome, my good old buddy, pal, friend, homie. These people have no idea what they're talking about scientifically.

Bot 1: No kidding!  Thank you so much for clearing that up for me. I almost started worry about it for a second. Whew this gives me peace of mind.

Bot 2: Yeah brother, don't let these paranoid schitzo get to you. My children's teeth are so white and clean!

Check the deleted comments. Note who deleted them. Note how my interaction with said account purposely used sarcasm which machines have a hard time with processing. Why would they delete a random, seemingly harmless comment like that?

**EDIT 6 (new thread):**

Quick anecdote.... So back when I was in the beginning stages of seeing through the veil, round 2018 or so... I was very pessimistic, cynical, a la all hope is lost, etc. So I made a comment about how hmmm... Orwell, Bradley, Huxley - why would this kind of lit be taught in public schools - they were obviously trying to induce predictive programming! Surprisingly, this was a highly upvoted post. And then... I saw a comment, Yo you should join our sub, the top minds of reddit.

Bam, that's when I figured out these bots just don't downvote content that is detrimental to the establishment... they'll also upvote content that works to their advantage! Essentially promoting people thinking in the wrong direction.

After dabbling in spirituality, philosophy, esoterics, occult, theosophy, pantheism, mystery schools, ESP, parapsychology, jung, alan watts, manly p hall, the dao, hinduism, edgar mitchell, thoreau, emmerson, mark passio, jane robertes (seth), neville goddard, etc., etc., etc., it has become clear I was so lost in hopelessness that I failed to recognize the light shining through!

""Light can only be seen in the presence of darkness""

""A tree cannot reach up to heaven unless it's roots reach down to hell""

These bots spew a lot of shit but the scariest thing is hopelessness. Our thoughts create. The world ""believe"" in Spanish translates to ""Creer"" or ""to create"". I'm sure most of you have heard of manifestation or the Law of Attraction. That's where the war is being waged now - in our minds.

**Prince Rogers Nelson – Yahoo Internet Life Awards (1999)**

There is a war going on. The battlefield’s in the mind. And, the prize in the soul. So, just be careful. Be very careful. Thank you."" - Prince

**David Bowie interview with Jeremy Paxman (1999)**

Bowie: Because I think that we, at the time up until at the least the mid 70s, really felt that we were still living under the… in the guise of a single and absolute created society where there were known truths and known lies and there was no kind of duplicity or pluralism about the things that we believed in.

That started to break down rapidly in the 70s and the idea of a duality in the way that we live. There are always two, three, four, five sides to every question. The singularity disappeared. And that I believe, has produced such a medium as the internet, which absolutely establishes and shows us that we are living in total fragmentation.

I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we’re actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.

Paxman: It’s just a tool though isn’t it?

Bowie: No, it’s not! No, it’s an alien life form (laughs).

Paxman: It’s simply a different delivery system though? You’re arguing about something more profound.

Bowie: Oh yeah. I’m talking about the actual context and the state of content is going to be so different to anything we can really envisage as the moment where the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico it’s going to crush our ideas about what mediums are all about.

**Edit 7 (new thread):**

Lastly just a quick reminder to go outside and feel the sun beaming on your body. Feel its warmth. Walk barefoot on the Earth and feel the electric energy reverberate through your body of energy and light. Look at another person and observe them making their way surrounded in their own universe of manifestations, thoughts and feelings. Now, notice how your own visual reality is being projected. For three minutes, just close your eyes, focus on your breathing. Slow it down and just be mindful of what thoughts pop into your head. Don't judge them, just observe. We are not our feelings, emotions, body or thoughts. We are the ones observing them.

Peace, love and light my brothers and sisters.

120,The Internet Is Being Censored Before Our Very Eyes. Are We Going to Simply Stand and Watch as Information and Opinions Dubbed Too Controversial For the Public Are Dissolved into Nothingness?,361.0,9jywl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9jywl7/the_internet_is_being_censored_before_our_very/,103.0,1538242538.0,"I have posted a similar comment elsewhere, but I'd like to reiterate this here, in a separate thread, as I think it is quite relevant to the situation we see unfolding all across the web. It is becoming quite obvious now to anyone truly watching - they are censoring the Internet before our very eyes.


It started with YouTube and their demonetizations of ""controversial content"", it continued with much of that content also being simply removed. 

[[A brief history of Youtube Censorship](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59jgka/a-brief-history-of-youtube-censorship)]

In these times, the term ""fake news"" was born. And although there is plenty of actual fake news on the Internet, the main intention of it was highly likely not very benevolent. As we have seen, it, in many ways, appeared in order to create a label that would immediately create a negative emotional reaction in people and put that label onto anything that the mainstream media desires to censor or discredit in its totality.


It continued with Google itself announcing it would hire staff that would [""curate"" search results for controversial topics in order to fight fake news and misinformation - Google has thus decided it will become an arbiter of truth, it has decided to base its search results on ""facts"", not links](https://dailycaller.com/2015/03/02/google-decides-what-is-fact-in-new-search-results-ranking-system/). Nowadays you can see that for certain search phrases, Google displays results that are very much in line with the mainstream narrative, pushing other results to later pages.


 Alex Jones, like him or hate him, should not have been removed the way he was - he was taken down from every social media site, YouTube and now his PayPal account has been blocked. No matter whether he is controlled opposition or not - he has been banned without a second thought...and this has set a dangerous precedent. The media apparatus is flexing its muscles and the corporate powers (as well as the rich families behind them) are showing what they can do. 

Reddit has followed suit, as it deleted many subs in relation to the Q conspiracy theory (which I personally do not believe in, however I disagree with the censorship) such as r/greatawakening. Now many subreddits on the list of subreddits certain mods desired banned have been quarantined.

Of course here we cannot forget the ominous push for the destruction of Net Neutrality in the US and the horrific EU law based on Articles 11 and 13, that will create a censorship apparatus of magnanimous proportions (dubbed the ""anti-meme"" law, as it would destroy memes, but that title doesn't do it justice, as that is the least of what this censorship monster can do)

[[Article 13 presented simply in a wonderful satirical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ZkydX0FPw&)]

[A site for taking action, if you are from the EU: [saveyoutinternet.eu](http://www.saveyourinternet.eu)]

*By the way, this law has already been passed! There is however another discussion taking place about it in January - contact your representatives by then if you are from the EU! I have done so once and will do it again, as I am from the EU myself.*

-----------------------------------------

If you look at the whole picture it becomes very obvious this goes far beyond any of these events individually. These companies that influence and curate web traffic and have an incredible monopoly on the Internet in terms of user-bases, are working together... and they are very slowly making their moves. 

But the moves are also being made by governments and other non-governmental organizations. It seems the agenda has been set and is being manifested into reality in perfect synchronicity by all parties involved.

All of this is happening very slowly, so that people will accept it. It is also happening in such a way that the censored parties are portrayed as villains, labelled hate speech or dubbed ""misinformation"" as has now happened with r/911truth.

 Anyone that has truly looked will see that they are censoring far more than truly extreme hate-speech (and is even censoring that ever beneficial? Does that not simply radicalize actual hate groups even more?)- they are censoring things they don't want the public to see or topics they don't want people to debate. 


The Internet has proven itself a vital weapon in the hands of the awakening movement. They see this and they are trying to correct their mistake. We should not let them correct it.

If we all refuse to be censored, they cannot censor us. It is a good idea to move to different platforms (www.saidit.net perhaps?), to have actual discussions with like minded individuals, but remaining, at least to a degree, in mainstream battlefields such as Reddit, is crucial in order to spread various information to a wider audience. 

When facing a mainstream audience, it is always crucial to present information in a manner that is coherent and articulate, as well as based on as many sources as one can find. It should also come from a place of peace and compassion, not hatred. If this is done, then the censorship will become much harder, as even the mainstream masses will see how obvious the supposed ""hate speech"" is anything but that - how could it be if it contains no hate?

Spread awareness of the subjects that matter, help spread solutions whenever possible, but always try to do it without resorting to hate, anger or fear. Also, speak against censorship whenever you can - it could be your controversial opinions that are censored next.

If there is crucial information, videos, articles, that you fear might become censored - *save them on your hard drive*.

As said, an option is definitely to move to other platforms, however if slowly everything gets censored, the only thing left would be blockchain based communication. 

**Any ideas you may have, any solutions that may be simmering in your minds - now is the time to put them forth and discuss them.**

And remember, take care of yourself and your health, both physical and mental. Meditate, introspect, allow yourself to find peace within, that is actually present right now ; allow yourself to open to the possibility of life being more than merely the material if you are ready to do so. Also, engage in real, genuine connections with real people in your everyday life - this is crucial for any New Earth to thrive.

I am cross posting it here so that if deep state functionaries are actually planning anything close to it, the plan might be foiled due to preemptive exposure. 

Begin with some data points that we already know:

- CNN just did a ""developing"" report three hours ago, stating that if a ""disaster happens"" that kills everybody at the inauguration, an Obama cabinet member would become president. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0YFqCHEN3Y

- The MSM is also going crazy today with reports that Hillary is set to become Mayor of NYC if she runs. She is not going to run and they are hyping this up for a reason that will be made clear below; for now, just note that they want it in the back of our minds, and they want it in our minds *now*, just two days before the inauguration. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/poll-shows-hillary-clinton-leading-hypothetical-race-york/story?id=44865703

- George and Barbara Bush literally called in sick today, and will not be at the inauguration. Because Bush is ""hospitalized."" MSM has been reporting it all day today. A letter from Bush to Trump explaining that he will not make it to the inauguration has been posted everywhere. http://abc13.com/news/bush-41-pens-letter-to-donald-trump/1709069/

- Body doubles are common for high ranking officials, and it was confirmed that Hillary has one when ""she"" miraculously recovered and emerged smiling after collapsing in front of the van. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/09/13/internet-thinks-hillary-clinton-has-body-double/90297312/

- More than 60 democrat politicians will not be there. (Excuse: they are ""boycotting"" it.) https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/16/more-than-30-democratic-lawmakers-now-skipping-trumps-inauguration/

- Obama will be there, but will be seated out of harm's reach. http://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/01/18/obama-refuses-to-comment-on-trump-inauguration-boycott-reveals/21657798/

- DisruptJ20 has been activated to cause vexation and chaos. In particular they will be interfering with check points.  They are encouraging black bloc affinity groups, which are notoriously easy for agents to infiltrate and perform more effective actions as ""protesters"" since everyone is dressed in black.  http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/17/new-okeefe-video-leftists-plan-blockade-trump-inauguration/

- From the perspective of the ruling regimes and the deep state, there is absolutely no way that Trump can be allowed to become president. He has threatened the CIA, the federal reserve, the pharma industry, NATO, and the mainstream media. (No link because this is obvious on a moment's reflection.)

- The head of the national guard is already set to be relieved of duty on the 20th at 12:01 PM. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aptJ8hH-iKM

Now with that data in mind, consider the following possibility: an explosion or other catastrophe, perhaps biochemical, or crash of aircraft, will occur close enough to Trump to kill him and many others on his team. It will have to be large and lethal enough to kill hundreds in the area. The nation will be traumatized as the carnage is seen on live broadcasts by millions. 

Suspicions that the Clintons were behind it will immediately arise, but will be put to rest since ""Hillary"" will be killed too, and *Gasp! How tragic! She would have been mayor!* It is actually her body double that will be killed, and the nation will have never guessed it.

The real Hillary may have already fled the country. 

The news about her wanting to run for mayor is designed to form in us the belief that she had future plans and thus would never be involved in a plot that ended up killing her too.

The world will be convinced that Trump and Hillary both died, though the reality is that Trump and Hillary's body double will have died. The real Hillary will live the rest of her life without being prosecuted for the many crimes she has committed, including some against children.

The catastrophe might be blamed on a terrorist or other figure or organization who ""made it through a checkpoint"" during the chaos caused by protests. Or evidence might be uncovered from the wreckage that links it to the scapegoat. It will be on a scale much larger than 9/11. 

Many prominent democrats will survive because they weren't there, as they were ""boycotting"" it.

Obama and others may be injured but will survive, or they will be seated out of harm's way. Or they too may have body doubles that will be killed. 

Most of the people on Trump's team who helped lead the 2nd American revolution will be killed, entrenching the US empire for good. 

Alex Jones and other prominent thought leaders may be eliminated as well.

Many other high ranking members of media or government and industry might be eliminated too, especially if they were involved in human trafficking rings. This will serve to tighten up any existing possibility of blackmail or leaks, as well as provide additional deniability that rogue elements of the deep state were behind the attack.

Theories that the deep state caused it will be rejected on the basis that ""Hillary and some democrats were killed too, so they couldn't have done it. Now is the time to come together as a nation.""

The nation will ""come together"" as the remaing republican and democrat leadership (McCain et al) begin total retaliation in Syria, which will force Russia into conflict.

Continuity of government programs will be initiated during the power vacuum until a different president is elected. 

CIA, the federal reserve, NATO, the Clintons, the Bushes, pharma, and the media will survive. Whatever leaks remain regarding Clinton's crimes or pedophile rings will never see the light of day.

US troops will begin attacks in Syria again ""to fight ISIS"", and Trump supporters will be so outraged that they will support it. NATO will thus be preserved. The war with Russia will finally begin by late 2017.

I don't want to leave things on a bad note, so here are at least two ways this possibility can be avoided.

Recommendation A: Trump should call the shots and hold the inauguration in a location of his choosing due to credible threats. He should be sworn in immediately at that location regardless of fanfare. He should not be partying in enemy territory where CIA agents have been planning for weeks now. 

Recommendation B: If Trump insists on having the inauguration as planned, his security detail should absolutely ensure that the real Hillary and the real Obama, not body doubles, are there and are in close physical proximity to Trump at all key times. This of course assumes that the real Hillary and the real Obama are still of any value to deep state actors. 

Mandatory whether A or B is chosen: Trump's team should make it known to the opposition that if anything happens to Trump, all leaks and footage confirming the activity of politicians and media moguls in pedophile rings will be immediately released by foreign allies who were in the possession of the material, ensuring there is an uprising against whatever government is left. 

#Edit: Video of CNN talking about ""disaster"" at inauguration has been pulled down. Here are alternatives: 

http://www.krcrtv.com/news/politics/disaster-could-put-obama-cabinet-member-in-oval-office/277462273

And another: http://www.news8000.com/news/politics/national-politics/disaster-could-put-obama-cabinet-member-in-oval-office/277461185

They are hyping up the possibility for some reason. Conditioning us? Very strange. 

(Note: if you are watching the inauguration at home, one way to falsify or confirm this theory is to carefully observe footage of Obama and Hillary et al. Are there close up shots of them, are they wearing dark shades to obscure their faces, is it really them or body doubles? If it is really them, where are they seated? Is it in a location that is out of target range? Are they ever near Trump?)",conspiracy,Alex Jones

Does anybody else find it rather odd, that on a sub called r/conspiracy, where a wide range of outlandish topics are free to be discussed, Pizzagate is somehow the *one* thing that gets pummeled into the ground? A conspiracy that was essentially handed to us on a silver platter, consisting of dozens of angles and several facets of circumstantial evidence to observe, somehow *each* and every aspect of the scandal/investigation, has its own little recited debunking talking point, and HAS to be attacked and downvoted. Every fucking time. Routinely.

Also, it's usually accompanied with very strange and inorganic voting on the post and in the comments. Usually 3-5 of the same users seem to come out of the woodwork, to spread their usual debunking techniques, and they seem to be ""coached"" almost, as I have observed the evolution of their anti-PG talking points/debunking attempts over the last year. The same new talking point seems to be pushed in unison as well, further evidence of coordination.

Take a look at this older PG thread that was posted last year. See that the comments actually reflect the conspiratorial attitude and openness to ideas like this?

https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d6ryy/pizza_gate_should_be_our_main_focus_if_we_expose/?st=JBHEJVT6&sh=b3d943ce


""Well, maybe that was before everyone realized it was bullshit?""

Oh that's right, Wikipedia, Snopes, and a slew of MSM sources claimed it was debunked, so it must be true. Does this sound like the mentality of a conspiracy sub? Regurgitating MSM talking points?  

Now, when you see any current PG thread, you have top comments that are *nowhere* near reflecting the attitude of the sub like they used to.  

PG posts have been gracing the front page of this sub for over a year now. So, if the users are interested in the investigation and upvoting the topic, **Then who the fuck is downvoting good comments, and upvoting skeptical/abrasive ones?** This looks shady as fuck...

I really hope most of the organic lurkers/users here are able to see this, and don't blindly accept every top comment of every thread at face value, or every downvoted/buried comment at the same token. 

Why is this particular conspiracy so vehemently attacked and injected with skepticism and outright rejection? Has anybody else noticed this transition in the attitude?

It means the 50% of Americans who don't believe the official story of 9/11 can be sued by the victims' families for defamation.

What about the moon landings, many people believe they were fake and the astronauts are lying. Doesn't this mean the astronauts should be able to sue the deniers for defamation?

There are people who claim the vaccines are dangerous and the pharmaceutical companies faked the data and hid the side effects. Now vaccine deniers can effectively be sued for defamation against pharmaceutical companies.

This also means anyone who downplays or questions the Holocaust can be sued for defamation as well.

Anyone who questions the election can be sued for defamation against Dominion Voting Systems.

It also means Democrats who accused Trump of colluding with Russia can be sued for defamation, it just depends on where the judge and jury are on the political spectrum.

I can't think of a conspiracy theory that doesn't involve accusing someone of something bad besides Bigfoot. This is one of the most significant court cases in American history.

I wouldn't be surprised if he was paid to talk about it by the company that produces atrazine, a potent herbicide. Mr. Jones de-legitimizes anything he touches and Syngenta the company that manufactures atrazine has spent millions covering up how harmful the chemical is to the environment and living organisms. 

To be clear, atrazine doesn't ""turn frogs gay"". However, it's been seen to cause [hermaphroditism](https://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/04/15_frogs.html) in frogs and even gender change in tadpoles. 

The link is an article written by the media relations guy on the University of California Berkely page. He breaks down the research of developmental endocrinologist Tyrone B. Hayes. Sadly, Syngenta basically destroyed Hayes' career after his original research was funded by Syngenta. He refused to change his findings to suit their corporate agenda and they really stuck it to him. 

Hayes doubts atrazine would have a strong effect on human hormone levels since we don't live in runoff water and atrazine doesn't accumulate in tissue. Atrazine has been used for over 40 years in 80 different countries and is used on 2/3 of all US corn crops. The EPA allows atrazine levels to be at 3 ppb (parts per billion) though Hayes showed hermaphroditism in frogs at levels as low as .1 ppb. Hayes believes this may be a main factor in the [global amphibian decline](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-are-frog-and-toad-populations-declining?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) seen since the 1960s.

So its safe to say that anything Michael Baden has been involved in is open for suspicion. 

the same way that anything that 'Pay Czar' Kenneth Feinberg has been involved in is open for suspicion. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Feinberg

so thats a nice red pill. 

the Epstein fake death has opened the door to fresh JFK etc speculations 

the Epstein fake death is also elegantly simple for the average layman to understand.

 the average layman can understand that the media is trying to promote only options A or B, when the truth is C.

and once the average layman can understand that kind of forced false choice, they understand the entire game.

they can also understand how the mainstream media and ""alternative media"" create these false A or B options

they can understand how CNN can come out with a A, then Alex Jones can come out with B, when the truth is closer to C    

then the door is opened up for fresh speculations regarding 9/11 etc

because the average layman can see that with 9/11, they were given the false choices between X or Y, when the truth is Z ionists

and now the Queen of England has been implicated in forcing the coverup at ABC news!

the same Queen of England who was implicated in the Jimmy Savile horror story ? 

just think of all the new avenues of exploration Epstein brings up... 

Brownstone operations and how Israel uses sex to compromise, blackmail and control US politicians

Page 1 of lawsuit against Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein that alleges Trump and Epstein raped a virgin, and made her a sex slave.

Page 2 of lawsuit against Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, alleging that both defendants raped the plaintiff, and argued over which one would take her virginity.

https://i.redd.it/vn4fbijvnk701.jpg  

The lawsuit was dropped just before the election, but NPR didn't bother to report that fact until the Friday after the election.

IIRC, this lawsuit was the first i had heard of Jeffrey Epstein. 

As a voter i was concerned about any candidate with such a scandalous lawsuit hanging over his head. 

so i dug into the co-defendant and here we are today. 

in hindsight, it appears that the media figured nobody knew who Jeffrey Epstein was, so they could just slap his name on the bogus rape lawsuit as a co-defendant, and if anyone looked into it, it would further smear Trump by his association to Epstein 

in hindsight, i think Israel had been using people like Jeffrey Epstein to compromise US politicians for a very long time, and therefore Israel had a very strong interest in making Jeffrey Epstein go away before any more damage to their brownstone operations was done.

in hindsight, i think putting Jeffrey Epstein as a co-defendant on the Trump rape lawsuit was a very big mistake, 

and it has boomeranged and snowballed up until today, November 5, 2019

But despite that, I wanted to cover this topic because I find it both fascinating and relevant, especially in the context of my last three threads:

[Chris Bledsoe and The Lady](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lp81sx/chris_bledsoe_and_the_lady/)

[The Sirius Connection](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m7jikm/the_sirius_connection/)

[EI and Tyler D.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m7k0tq/ei_and_tyler_d/)

Even if you believe Earth is flat, try to read with an open mind. The way I’ve heard it explained, is that space is like the astral realm. If someone dreams that Earth is a disc, and another dreams that it is a ball, who is more right? One experience doesn’t invalidate the other. I’m also open to the idea that many astronauts and secret space program insiders and whistleblowers are actually victims of MKUltra. But again, if reality is what we experience inside our heads, who’s to say their experiences aren’t real? Keep these things in mind as you read on.

[In the Netflix series The OA, test subjects are sent to the astral realm, which happens to be near Saturn's rings, by temporarily drowning them.](https://preview.redd.it/m6b9jjyb79q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c6362fbf2a30fd8df60e3cf9315fe90fe936870)

In 2002, a man named Gary McKinnon was accused of perpetrating the ""biggest military computer hack of all time.” McKinnon hacked into 97 US military and NASA computers. He claimed he was looking for evidence of free energy suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity. In an interview, McKinnon said that after hacking into the NASA and US military networks, he found a document entitled “non-terrestrial officers”. It was an excel sheet listing the ranks of unknown individuals. Another document had tabs for “material transfers between ships”. McKinnon was charged by the Bush Justice Department and was facing 70 years in prison. However, in an open court, Gary’s attorney would be able to subpoena the non-terrestrial officers to testify about their involvement in the secret space program, so the case has gone nowhere.

[Gary McKinnon](https://preview.redd.it/ux965nn389q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8a0f93f6c928891862f06bef15303844e72fa91)

Supposedly, the documents uncovered by McKinnon were from of a secret program called Solar Warden, a space fleet that operates under the US Naval Network and Space Operations Command, or the NNSOC. Apparently, there are over 300 people who work at Solar Warden. Solar Warden is said to consist of 8 massive cigar-shaped “motherships” and around 40 smaller “scout ships”. Supposedly each mothership is longer than two football fields in length. Allegedly, USSS Lemay and USSS Hillenkoetter are the names of two of the ships in the fleet.

[An artist's rendition of a Solar Warden \\""mothership\\""](https://preview.redd.it/s46b8xe189q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93b13458015f018ec0f7bc92b7fda114dac1be95)

While all this sounds far-fetched, the documents seem to confirm a statement made by Ben Rich during a 1993 Alumni Speech at UCLA. Ben Rich was the man responsible for leading the development of the F-117 as well as the second Director of Lockheed’s Skunk Works. Rich said: “We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an Act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.”

[Ben Rich](https://preview.redd.it/0adfp94d89q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=94d549fb27d291cd8ad6e335abde8f3594d6a778)

There are many conspiracy theories surrounding Solar Warden. Some say it was created to defend Earth from malevolent extraterrestrials and asteroids. Others say it contains cloning facilities and laboratories where mind controlled super soldiers are trained. There are also those who claim Solar Warden’s true purpose is to control the traffic of benevolent ETs so a true disclosure doesn’t occur. I personally believe there are both good and bad ETs, and project Blue Beam will be used to facilitate a false disclosure of demonic beings.

[Project Blue Beam: What Is Serge Monast's Bold Theory?](https://allthatsinteresting.com/project-blue-beam-serge-monast)

Allegedly, there are more secret space programs than just Solar Warden. According to Corey Goode, a supposed insider, Lockheed is also a part of an organization called the ICC, or the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate. Apparently, the ICC trades goods with ETs at their bases on Mars. Corey claims the bases are staffed by slaves who were taken from Earth. Oddly enough, in 2015, the British Interplanetary Society held a meeting asking how a hypothetical Martian colony might overthrow a dictator.

[How to overthrow a Martian dictatorship - BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150619-how-to-overthrow-a-martian-dictatorship)

Even more odd, this meeting took place just a few days after Goode made his claims. Robert David Steele, a former CIA spy, also claims there is a slave colony on Mars. NASA had to make an official statement saying they are not hiding kidnapped children on the red planet.

[Nasa spokesperson forced to deny that space agency has put child sex slaves on Mars - The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/nasa-mars-child-sex-slave-colony-space-agency-alex-jones-infowars-robert-david-steele-a7816371.html)

According to other supposed insiders, there is an interplanetary empire made up of interstellar spacecraft called the Dark Fleet. The fleet is supposedly inhabited by reptilian beings who come from the Orion constellation. The reptilians are said to be controlled by an AI. Some say the Germans made deals with these beings during World War II in exchange for advanced technology. Len Kasten has a great book about the subject called Dark Fleet: The Secret Nazi Space Program and the Battle for the Solar System.

&#x200B;

[An artist's depiction of the Dark Fleet](https://preview.redd.it/akvh57sn6eq61.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3fe1ff734047cb3731c1f0ebef5f50c1a4f156ed)

Other secret space programs include the MILAB projects, or “military abduction” projects. Allegedly, there are Moon bases where children are taught telepathy and other occult practices. Kids are abducted by military spacecraft in the middle of the night and taken there. While all this sounds crazy, there are many supposed whistleblowers who have come out and recounted their experiences in incredible detail. People like Tony Rodrigues, Penny Bradley, and Aug Tellez have very interesting stories. I encourage you to listen to their testimonies.

[Secret Space Program & Flat Earth Dome /w Aug Tellez - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-icjXbVJfCo)

But what does any of this have to do with my last three threads? Well, if you remember where we left off, I was talking about how a Tyler is someone who guards the entrance of a Masonic lodge. They guard it with a special wavy blade called “The Flaming Sword of the Tyler”.

[The Flaming Sword of the Tyler](https://preview.redd.it/eehzbh03e9q61.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be75b0694cfd0bba47b19d3f8766bb95cadffe04)

The Flaming Sword is a reference to the sword used by Uriel, the angel who guards the Gate of Eden against the return of Man in the Book of Genesis. Remember in the last thread it was implied that a being named Tyler guards Sirius, the entrance of the Celestial Lodge, or Heaven.

[A painting of Uriel holding their flaming sword](https://preview.redd.it/nwqgah77e9q61.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa2507b7afac594af8bc501544e86a822e515ab4)

Ironically, in the show WandaVision, a man named Tyler is the head of S.W.O.R.D., an intelligence agency that focuses on extraterrestrial operations. This seems to be a reference to “Tyler” from American Cosmic and Solar Warden.

[The character Tyler from WandaVision](https://preview.redd.it/touol34be9q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aecba27f04f9bcc3a1a7d3b6856b12cb3fbabb88)

Even more ironic, Tyler eventually redirects S.W.O.R.D.’s efforts to focus more on robotics, nanotechnology, and AI. Interestingly, S.W.O.R.D. stands for Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division. Remember, some people think Tyler D. is actually a rouge living AI, or EI.

So, how does The Lady fit into all this? Well, according to legend, it was the Lady of the Lake who gave King Arthur his magical flaming sword, Excalibur. It was said to be forged in Avalon, another paradisal realm. But I’ll go into this more in the next thread. Thanks for reading!

d’abo, Henri & Tatiana: John Henry Erland d’Abo is the grandson of the 9th Duke of Rutland (more info on what these titles all mean can be found here: [https://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the-peerage/what-is-the-peerage/](https://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the-peerage/what-is-the-peerage/)). Tatjana is his wife. Henry is the chairman of Wilton Payments Ltd, a private company that helps with financial intermediation. He and Christopher O’Neill are the primary shareholders of the company. O’Neill is Tatjana’s half-brother, a British-American financier, and husband to Princess Madeleine, [Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Madeleine,_Duchess_of_H%C3%A4lsingland_and_G%C3%A4strikland), a daughter of [King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Carl_XVI_Gustaf_of_Sweden).

**d’abo, Mrs. Jennifer: British entrepreneur who passed away in 2003. d’Abo was once married to Peter Cadbury from the family of the famous chocolate company. Peter did not work for the company, but he and Jennifer d’Abo had a son together. Their son, Joel Cadbury, became owner of the Groucho Club, a watering hole often frequented by famous people. Three years after Cadbury sold the club, their website became the center of a child pornography scandal (link to story:** [**https://www.sott.net/article/242698-Groucho-Clubs-website-forum-hit-by-child-pornography-scandal**](https://www.sott.net/article/242698-Groucho-Clubs-website-forum-hit-by-child-pornography-scandal)**)**

D’Alessie, Carman: This name turned up no results, however, we can safely assume that this is actually Carmen D’Alessio, the international nightlife guru who helped spawn Studio 54 and other famous clubs. She is a party legend with countless celebrity ties.

d’Arenberg, Prince Pierre: Family lineage can be traced back 1000 years. European royalty. Extremely wealthy not because of his ties to nobility, but because his mother, Margaret Bedford, was an heiress to Standard Oil (Exxon).

d’Uzes, Jacques De crussol: The 17th Duke of Uzes. Not much else found on him. Margaret Bedford married into his family shortly after her divorce with Prince Charles Auguste Armand d’Arenberg, father of Prince Pierre d’Arenberg.

Dabbagh, Amr A.: A wealthy businessman/investor from Saudi Arabia. Dabbagh recently faced corruption charges but settled with the Saudi Arabian government. Has ties all around the world, as he is a member of and/or serves/served on the boards of the World Economic Forum, London Business School, Cleveland Clinic, Jeddah Economic Forum, Harvard Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East, etc.

Dahl, Sophie: ‘90s-’00s model-turned-author and maternal granddaughter of famous author Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, etc.) Dahl has been seen in photos with Ghislaine Maxwell.

Darrin, Drake: Not much information found. Darrin runs an investment group out of Greenwich, Connecticut. Lived about a mile away from Epstein in NYC.

Dartmouth, William: The 10th Earl of Dartmouth. Member of the European Parliament from 2009-2019. Became a stepbrother of Princess Diana when his mother embarked on a 2nd marriage with Diana’s father, John Spencer.

Davies, Jeff: Most likely refers to the current CFO for Legal & General Group. Davies was once a senior partner at Ernst & Young.

Davies, David & Linda: Sir David Davies is a wealthy banker and businessman with deep connections. A family friend introduced him to David Rockefeller back in the ‘60s, which helped him get his start. Linda, daughter of a Chinese-Malaysian tycoon, is his second wife. They were married for over 20 years but are now divorced.

Davis, Michael: A current partner at N3 Media, Davis has had many jobs. He started out working at CAA, one of the top agencies in the world. Check out this list of celebrities and athletes that they represent ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Creative\_Artists\_Agency\_clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Creative_Artists_Agency_clients)). Davis then went on to produce movies and TV shows before transitioning to digital media.

Day, Nick and Heather: Not much to be found on these two. There are several articles that speak of their ranch in Kenya. Apparently, it is a fairly popular spot where people stay to get some rest and solitude.

de Andrade, Marcelo: An international banker (not the serial killer) who lives within one mile of Epstein’s mansion in NYC. de Andrade was married to Lisa Bjornson, a successful banker and higher-up at J.P. Morgan Securities back in the ‘90s.

de Baecque, Patrick: de Baecque has his hands in online news media (lefigaro.fr) in France. de Baecque was named Director of Sales and Operations at Dolead in 2017. Dolead is a company that is involved with online marketing.

de Cabrol, Milly: A high-end interior designer based out of NYC.

De Cadenet, Alen: Alain de Cadenet is one of Epstein’s many Formula One contacts. Someone here probably knows more about de Cadenet, but he used to be a racecar driver and now works for ESPN and the Speed Channel as a host.

de Clermont-Tonnerre, Hermine: A French princess who used to have a penchant for partying. The only daughter of Charles Henri, 11th Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre, Hermine was one of 500 guests invited to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother’s 100th birthday back in 2000. Hermine got in a motorcycle crash a month ago that put her in a coma.

***De Georgiou, Anouska: A former British Playboy model who claims that Epstein groomed and raped her as a teenager when she met him in the 1990s. Her experience with Epstein is detailed in this article (***[***https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9974171/anouska-de-georgiou-jeffrey-epstein-rape-claims-nbc-playboy/***](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9974171/anouska-de-georgiou-jeffrey-epstein-rape-claims-nbc-playboy/)***). She speaks about how Epstein was able to lure her into the life as a young girl.***

De Soto, Fernando: Very difficult to pinpoint. Best guess is that this is the Head of Real Estate at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Madrid, Spain. I could be wrong, but this is the one that made the most sense.

Summary of the article: Dubin was the first one accused by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. Rinaldo Rizzo, Dubin’s chef, testified that sexual activities occurred between Dubin and a 15-year-old girl, which led to him and his wife quitting as personal chefs of the Dubins. Dubin’s wife, Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, dated Epstein for a long time before she married Dubin. The couple was so close with Epstein that even after Epstein was convicted in 2008 and officially a registered sex offender, they invited him to Thanksgiving dinner and wrote a letter to his probation officer that they trusted him around their children, who were all minors at the time. Multiple sources say Epstein was actually their children’s Godfather, but a spokesman for the couple denies it. Glen Dubin and Epstein helped each other with their business ties, as well.

So recently one of my best friends admitted (by himself) that I was right on certain subjects (censoring / misinformation / passeports etc)

I was suprised and I was like ""Ok maybe his door is finnaly open"". He is not vaccinated yet (funny because he believe all this crap, I feel like is subconcious is in battle with the unconscious).

So then I go..into my habbits : upcoming genocide, blood clots, upcoming mark of the beast in right hand, persécution coming for unvaxx, camps coming for unvaxx etc... you get the picture

My logic is this : since I was right 2 years in advance on almost everything and he admitted it, he must now accept that I have a pretty good chance of ""predicting"" the future

Well guess what, he said this : ""you are crazy with your conspiracy, you sound like Alex Jones""

I said : ""you are talking about a guy that was right 15 years in advance just saying""

Anyway then we argue about the vaccine and covid being just a basic flu mostly and fulled by the media.

Now the CRAZY part.

I almost begged him (because he is a medical / ""The science"" guy. Not science of course...""The science"""".

He did not want to watch 2x videos that I specifically choose that I knew would make him go ""wtf"" (reason was if a Doctor have is clinic burned and liscence revoked is because it must be a good thing...crazy and scary stufd)

The videos :

- Dr Charles Hoffe speaking about spike protéine and blood clots

- Dr Ryan Cole talking about same thing

After one hour of useless arguing, he check the videos.

He calls me back

""Ok I am in, this is absolutely crazy. This doctor is really an expert in his field.  I analyze people well and this us a good doctor in his heart and good in his field""

Right now In my head I am like ""finnaly you brainwashed drone""

Then we talk about the video...and something is not right...he was deminishing the video he just saw the more and more the talk was going...at start he was like wtf...but the more and more we talk...the more and more he was changing what he saw

It like if he was...during a 5min spam reprogramming himself back to the original MSM narrative...it was fascinating and frightning.

For exemple, in the video the doctor cleary state the extreme reduce in lifespam and blood clots...so here is the final talk with him

""You know he spoke about blood clots ?""

""No that not what he meant, he was talking about it limiting your activies a little bit, but it still incredible""

""You know he said people getting 2-3 shots like that have not more than 10 years to live ? At least that what he said?""

""I dont think he said that""

""Did you watch the whole video?""

Now the crazy part

""Yah and by the way anyway covid is still worse than the shot I have a friend that got it and it was rough""

I make a complete silence...

""You there (my name)?""

""Yah""

""You dont think COVID is worse than this vaccine ? Why?""

""No (his name) it not worse than blood clots and reduced lifespam...you do remember I got it and said it a was normal flu...all my office tested positive and I got sick at the same time""

""Dont think you got it. Covid is hardcore and you never tested. You see you starting conspiracy crap again with blood clots""

""Did you watch the second video?""

""I dont need to watch your conspiracy videos anymore I saw what I need to see with the first one. Dont need to listen to more not credible doctors""

*remeber what he said when he called me first about the doctor I showed him being good and all*

""Hey I have another call cya""

I was like WTF. The guy fucking reprogrammed himself and LITTERALY denied what he saw. 

I mean he can be not ok with the info, but he simply denied what he saw and fucking reprogrammed himself during our conversation to protect his godamn narrative.

Like a lot of people with wisdom said : it easier to change the mind of millions than one single people one on one.

Every one of these groups has their role in the assisting of creating false narratives and manufacturing consent and it is through keeping the vast majority of the population trapped in these incorrect paradigms that they have any power over us to begin with.

How many elites are there in a the world, really? A few thousand, tops. We hear the same names being circled around and around for the most part, and then if we add the ones in the shadows we DON'T know about and their most trusted associates, we truly and literally outnumber them a million-to-one... which honestly really goes to show you just how cunning and experienced these players are on the global chess board. It's quite a feat to be able control that many people.

Now, honestly imagine being born into a family like that and knowing the truth about how EVERYTHING operates in this world without having to guess. Are Alex Jones, Elon Musk and Russell Brand controlled opposition? There is no guesswork. You just know. (Whereas I do not.) So your worldview is not only certain, but you see how easily just a small handful of you are able to fool billions of people. It might astonish you at first to discover this as you grew up, and that astonishment might turn into contempt for a species of creatures so easily controlled. It's not hard to see aspects of their worldview, even if I disagree with it... but this is where it gets interesting.

I don't think the elites counted on us evolving as fast as we have out of a dark slumber, and I don't think they realize their contempt for us is completely misplaced, as humans aren't exactly given the chance to make a choice when they grow up programmed from birth. The 90's and 2000's were a time of connecting organically on the internet and it proved that humans DO, when given a chance, learn, grow and break free of conditioning much quicker as they learn about each others differences. The wild west of the internet was an amazing time. The **vitriol** we see on the internet is LARGELY due to everything going mainstream around 2005-2010 and narratives of division starting to be manufactured there. Prior to that, human beings self-regulated much more successfully online and we respected one another. We are NOT the sheep we think they are by **default.** It is only through lifetimes of conditioning us that the elites get the results they want. We got a little freedom on Internet 1.0 for a while to explore as we saw fit and that freedom was waking us up organically, so Big Brother panicked, came in and started regulating everything as quick as he could. Took them a while though... long enough for some of us to experience the \*vast\* difference that social media and Silicon Valley have made.

Do you guys remember this 1 minute scene from A Bug's Life? (bottom) I wouldn't be surprised if the rise of the internet and the new ability to instantly share information sparked conversations like this behind closed doors. In essence, THEY realize that if WE realize what they are up to and that we vastly outnumber them, they're completely screwed. It is only through the *illusion* of control that they actually have any control, and as long as they keep billions of people brainwashed and docile, they will maintain that power.

The good news is, not every single one of us has to wake up. We outnumber them SO much that we only need a fraction of people to wake up, and we're getting closer, for a tipping point.

The bad news is, those that remain asleep will stand in our way. However, like everything else manufactured on the internet, I'm convinced there are FAR less of them than we're led to believe. Most people will either be on our side or will remain on the fence and let the battle play itself out. The elites have far fewer allies than they want us to believe. The easiest way to realize this is just ask yourself, **how many people do you actually know that like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?**

So if you wonder why things in the world are so absolutely chaotic right now and have been since 2020, I suspect it's because the Elites are realizing they are running out of time. Covid was a Hail Mary for them and it failed, so now they're crashing the economy and starting a war. They know if they don't get a noose around the 1st world quickly, it's going to be over for them. So in a sense, take heart. Their sloppiness lately is a result of them rushing the plan out of panic.

We vastly outnumber them.

Peace.

181,"Journalist Tim Pool; ""We have handed over the public square to private companies. These companies can now decide who gets to participate in political debate. This is where most people debate and share ideas and now we have no right to the public discussion.""",238.0,9571ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9571ek/journalist_tim_pool_we_have_handed_over_the/,64.0,1533603503.0,"Putting aside the content of any given act of censorship (although the Alex Jones situation is certainly what drove the above quote), the insight of [Tim Pool's statement](https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1026605760971792384) reflects a nuanced understanding as to the more fundamental (and terrifying) shift currently occurring with regards the form of the public sphere.

What used to be an amorphous concept, defined by the participation of individual human beings, is slowly shifting into a privatized realm with boundaries demarcated by a select few monied factions. This, in turn, undermines the very purpose of a shared public space accessible to all. In that regard, the legitimacy of representative democracy itself is at stake, as only through the free exchange of ideas and information can the standing of the individual person be engendered in the larger social, civil and political context.

In that way, for small groups of private companies to abscond from that central principle, simply because ideas make some uncomfortable, is a bastardization of the ethos of free flowing information which brought rise to their original dominance. 

That said, in no way am I advocating for complete anarchy with regards what statements should be allowed into the public discourse (it has always been the case that certain actions would be entirely unwelcome in the town square, be it running naked or shouting fire in a crowded theater). The very nature of those exclusions is rooted in a common sense prohibition on imminent physical danger caused by one's words, and rightfully serves as a buffer to protect the community at large from wanton or reckless behavior. 

To those ends, when private companies are entrusted with the task of overseeing the public sphere there exists a duty to remove some content (such as terrorist recruitment videos, snuff films, child pornography, etc). Doing so, out of a respect for a common sense recognition that some behaviors have no place in the public sphere, is not only justified, it is necessary within a free and open society.

However, these same companies also (rightfully) show a strong aversion to embracing or admitting to the policing of content or viewpoints expressed on their platform (to put this in other terms; if youtube removes a terrorist recruitment video, they are not per se removing the video due to the beliefs of those who posted the content, but instead due to the fact that the aim of the video is to increase acts of terrorism.) 

This paradox, and the danger of allowing private companies to make decisions as to where to draw the line, is what risks destroying the public sphere itself. 

Currently the framework guiding the decisions made by social media companies as to the moderation of content versus the moderation of behavior is supposed to be legal more so than ideological; the platforms in question, those which control the public forum at large, are only able to operate under a legal ""safe harbor"" as a ""shared public forum"" if they fundamentally respect all viewpoints in a content neutral manner. To do otherwise would  be to engage in editorialization, which would thus bring said companies under a more strict legal scrutiny as to the content posted on their platform (something that those companies want to avoid at all costs). However, as enforcement of that safe harbor is left to outdated statutes and out of touch lawmakers, the final arbiter of the distinction ends up being the private companies themselves.

Clearly walking such a high stakes tight rope should not be at the discretion of these companies alone, as such self-oversight opens the door to a conflict of interest, encouraging these companies to ""have their cake and eat it as well"" by way of censoring content behind the veil of ""moderating dangerous behavior"". To that end, it is imperative that a regulatory framework be devised (beyond simply revoking the safe harbor status of social media sites) in order to safe guard the very core of representative democracy from the arbitrary, closed source, and veiled decision making processes of large technology companies. 

Some may suggest that there is a danger in taking such an approach, due to the risk of government causing more harm than good even with the best of intentions. However, after situations like the one which unfolded today (wherein the flow of information was clearly targeted based on its content, yet removed on the basis of ""threatening behavior""), it becomes clear that entrusting a group of private monied factions to make such a monumental decision in the context of a democratic republic is entirely abhorrent to the friend of popular government and learned statesman alike.

As Madison himself noted so eloquently in Federalist no. 10, it is very much the role of government to make just these types of interventions when the Republic itself is threatened by a conflagration of powerful monied groups;

>[**AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.** The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. **The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.** However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp)

>[No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp)



Thus it is clear that, shall the public sphere itself continue to survive (be it in the American Republic or elsewhere), there must be some semblance of structural prohibition on small groups of powerful monied factions being handed unchecked authority as to the censorship of content within the public sphere. To do otherwise would be to give up on the Enlightenment project, and thus the autonomy of man himself (along with his thoughts) would be lost.

It also injects a blatant partisan bias into its followers, magnetizing them toward the “right” or republican side of the paradigm. 

Either way, it convinces people to hold onto hope with the trump administration, and portrays them as a group of “outsiders” tackling DC corruption. It pacifies it’s followers and fills them with false hope. It’s sad as an outsider to watch people fall for it. 

It’s dangerous, because it injects a blatant partisan bias into its followers. IMO, “Q” is a project of either the intelligence agencies or the current administration. It needs to be exposed for what it is.

Spiritual Awakening through Lockdown

After reading one of the top threads here this morning, I felt inspired to share my experience of the lockdowns and the last five years of my life.

In my 20s, I was your average liberal white girl pursuing her dream of working in Hollywood. I worked as an actress in advertising, dated some celebrities, hung out at cool clubs and tried so so hard to ""make it.""

Then, in mid-2016, I had a severe wakeup call around my health - it was failing, and I was forced to confront my multitude of coping mechanisms for my spiritual bankruptcy. Alcohol was the first to go, then an exercise addiction, followed by eliminating animal products out of a newly recovered empathy, and finally a full blown spiritual awakening from deep dives into ancient literature (esoterics, theosophy, mysticism, yoga, etc.) I was reading 12 hours a day for months, absorbing anything and everything.

This awakening eventually led me to the conspiracies of the modern world, from bankers wars to 9/11 to trauma based mind control to the medical industrial complex. This first year in my new world perspective was jarring to the system, and sometimes I felt like I was losing my mind, but mostly I just saw the matrix all around me and it was stunning. I tried so hard to show others what I was seeing, but they mostly dismissed me, and my boyfriend broke up with me.

Finally I found some balance in my life, through continued esoteric study, occasional conspiracy research, and art. I became nomadic, shifted my value systems, attracted new people into my life with similar experiences and world views. Life was becoming blissful.

Cut to 2020. I began the year knowing it would be difficult planetarily, simply based on the astrological charts. (I'm not talking cosmopolitan horoscopes, i'm talking [esotericastrology.org](https://esotericastrology.org))  I came to India to find some peace and beauty, and I did exactly that. I stepped away from the world scene for several months, and when people started discussing coronavirus, I dismissed it, and ignored it for as long as I could.

Then I heard Tom Hanks was one of the first celebrities to get it in Australia, and I knew the whole thing was a sham. How? Well, Tom Hanks has been playing into the globalist agenda for many years, and anybody who watched Ricky Gervais roast Hollywood at the Golden Globes last year knows his behavior has been, well, suspect.

To those who've never gone down conspiracy rabbit holes, what I'm saying might sound crazy. But now that you all have seen what the global elites are capable of and how BATSHIT INSANE this [coronacircus.com](https://coronacircus.com) has been, I'm feeling more confident about sharing this information.

This psychological operation has been in the making for ages, just like 9/11 was. We are dealing with an incredibly complex cabal that works on an occult level. We are in an inverted world, where up has become down, 2+2=5, and masks (see: deception) are our savior. 

My boyfriend yesterday convinced me it's time for me to start a website where I can tie together everything i've been studying the last 5 years. I know to many on this sub I will come across as a lunatic, a David Icke wannabe or an alt-right Trump supporter. I am neither, although I respect Icke's commitment to his work, despite being one of the most reviled conspiracists out there (behind of course Alex Jones, whom I never followed.)

Anyway, if this long post piques the interest of even one person and offers just a glimmer of possible sanity in this insane world, then it's worth posting. I'm done caring about the reactions of others. Humanity deserves better than this, we deserve the knowledge of reality and the freedom to unfold and self-actualize. 

Some helpful links / podcasts I recommend to my friends but have been reluctant to share otherwise:

[The Higherside Chats](https://www.thehighersidechats.com/) with Greg Carlwood (open-minded stoner from San Diego who brings on a variety of guests to discuss all things alternative, from UFOs to Health to the Cabal to the Electric universe. Guests have included Nassim Haramein, Bob Lazar, Steven Greer, Dr. Joseph Farrel)

[Rune Soup](https://runesoup.com/) with Gordon White (Discussions on magic and the occult with a brilliant, very well-read mind)

[Those Conspiracy guys](https://thoseconspiracyguys.com/)(Longggg episodes but very well researched and comedic by Irish blokes)

[The China Study](https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660) (pioneering study on the effects of animal food by a classically trained Western doctor that led to him being harassed and questioning everything he knew)

[The World Peace Diet](https://www.amazon.com/World-Peace-Diet-Spiritual-Harmony/dp/1590565274/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+world+peace+diet&qid=1593235230&s=books&sr=1-1) (brilliant but heavy book about the roots of veganism and its ethics. Was instrumental in my awakening, but not for the faint of heart.)

[https://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/](https://www.whatthehealthfilm.com/) Netflix doc describing the benefits of eating plant based

[A Guide For the Perplexed by E.F. Schumacher](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Perplexed-F-Schumacher/dp/0060138599) first intro back into spirituality and higher dimensions of existence after many years of being brainwashed by materialistic atheistic science

[laurency.com](https://laurency.com) Swedish esoterician publishing Pythagorean hylozoics. Took me two years of daily reading to get through all of his works. Most important read of my life, re-reading now.

[the works of Rene Guenon](https://archive.org/details/reneguenon) Read every book of Guenon (hence my user name) after discovering him in Guide for the Perplex. Mind-blowing for my university / NYTimes conditioned mind.

[YouTube channel Academy of Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/user/academyofideas) \- 10 min vids discussing the views of important philosophers and offering some sanity. Not as far as out as a lot of the other sources I like.

[Truthstream Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TRUTHstreammedia) \- well produced documentary films exploring issues like Mind Control (particularly recommend their film Minds of Men.)

[Boiler Room](https://www.alternatecurrentradio.com/news-radio/acr-boiler-room/) \- the Social Rejects club, based out of Texas. Probably too right-leaning for many on this sub, and I don't agree with all of their views (particularly not their view of veganism, which is very negative), but they offer an alternative perspective on current events I think many of you will appreciate.

[The Corbett Report](https://www.corbettreport.com/) \- Weekly videos, incredible documentary films (his recent 4 part series on Bill Gates is essential viewing, as is How Big Oil Conquered the World)

[Jimmy Dore](https://www.youtube.com/user/TYTComedy) \- progressive comedian who questions the mainstream and has been seeing through the DNC bullshit for years, particularly last election. Enough is enough, the democrats are centrist, corporate neo-libs, not progressive saviors!

Conspiracy topics related to our current situation: Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, Tavistock Institute, MK Ultra, Carroll Quigley's [Tragedy and Hope](https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/tragedy_and_hope_quigley_full1090pg.pdf), Gary Allen's [None Dare Call it Conspiracy](http://www.amarilloteaparty.net/uploads/none-dare-call-it-conspiracy.pdf), Bill Cooper's [Behold a Pale Horse](https://archive.org/details/BeholdAPaleHorse_201807)



Alright, that's enough for now, hopefully this was helpful for at least one person out there. Stay strong my fellow lockdown skeptics, there's light at the end of this tunnel, even if it may take hundreds of years ;)



TL;DR: I've been spiritually seeking and aware of conspiracy for the last half decade so the lockdown is no surprise to me and sadly makes sense in the larger scheme of things. That said, it still SUCKS and is not the direction I want to see humanity moving. I believe the way forward is raising awareness and consciousness, so I'm sharing what's helped me along my path.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

1. The Dreyfus Affair  
   
In the late 1800s in France, Jewish artillery officer [Alfred Dreyfus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dreyfus) was wrongfully convicted of treason based on false government documents, and sentenced to life in prison.  
The French government did attempt to cover this up, but Dreyfus was eventually pardoned after the affair was made public (an act that is credited to writer Émile Zola).



2. The Mafia  
   
This secret crime society was virtually unknown until the 1960s, when member Joe Valachi first revealed the society's secrets to law enforcement officials. What was known was that organized crime existed, but not that the extent of their control included working with the CIA, politicians and the biggest businesses in the world.  
\-  
Many people do not realize that J. Edgar Hoover, the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States, was appointed director of the Bureau of Investigation - predecessor to the FBI - in 1924 and was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935, where he remained director until his death in 1972.  
 \-  
Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a large and efficient crime-fighting agency, and with instituting a number of modern innovations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. For the majority of his time as FBI Director, there were numerous Mafia shootings as a result of Prohibition. Hoover continued to deny the very existence of organized crime. Many figures in politics and media denied the existence of the Mafia, which had no official title.  
 \-  
Gangsters like Gambino and Capone were thought of as Street Kings only, just running local operations. It was not until the 1960's until people began to learn that a very organized system of superiors and control existed within the organized crime world. Arnold Rothstein, the man who rigged the World Series, started the major drug trade and is credited as being the ""King of the Roaring 20's.""  
 \-  
In his biography, he is said to have brought Lucky Luciano into his business and trained him to start ""The Commission."" Five families in New York would work together and pay their dues. Throughout the entire time the media and the FBI denied the mafia existed, in reality, not only did it exist, but it operated in multiple territories.  
 \-  
Each region had a boss and underboss, with soldiers underneath them.  
\-   
Above the boss was a Don and even above a Don was more figures. As it went up, regions got larger. It was extremely organized, down to the books. In the 1950's, crime bosses from around the United States met to centralize their power and organize their system. All this time, the public was told that the organized crime world didn't exist, and that all the crimes were committed by local gangsters...  
\-  
Even with all we knew about how organized the mafia was during prohibition, people still laugh at the idea of organized crime conspiracies taking place in politics.  
 \-  
Usually the excuse people will give you is something along the lines of,  
""I just don't think people are that organized...""  
Funny how easy it must be to get away with stuff these days, no one believes its possible....

by **Theresa Walla**  
**United Press International**  
**March 9, 1985**  
   
Journalism professor Nathaniel Blumberg was so disturbed about the investigation into the attempted assassination of President Reagan that he turned his suspicions into a 377-page novel.  
In *The Afternoon of March 30* , Blumberg blends fact and fiction in looking at the unreported ""connections"" between Hinckley's family and that of Vice President George Bush, the man who came within a heartbeat of the presidency of the United States.  
""What I'm really after is the case to be officially reopened,"" said the Rhodes scholar and former dean of the University of Montana journalism school.  
   
""If they can answer all the questions satisfactorily, I'll be delighted,"" he said in an interview. ""In truth, I don't think all the questions can be answered without opening up a whole new can of worms.""  
Blumberg's unease is now focused on the indifference shown to what he calls ""the story behind the story.""  
   
Bush, he said, has questions to answer in connection with the attempt. So do the FBI and the judge who presided over Hinckley's trial, according to Blumberg.  
""I'm not saying there was a conspiracy to assassinate Reagan,"" Blumberg emphasized. ""I'm saying there was a conspiracy to keep significant information from the public that it has a right to know.""  
Blumberg asks his readers to consider his contentions that journalists were fed a barely believable story full of inconsistencies. A long-time media critic, he decided the example warranted more than a critique of press performance in a crisis. Such efforts, he said, usually ""go out there and die.""  
   
Instead, he chose to weave his questions into a novel so it would reach a broader audience and allow him to probe problems in society and corruption in government, as well as maladies of the U.S. press.

Here are some of the videos of the testimony from MK Ultra survivors during court cases against the government:

**VIDEOS DELETED. (i will try to find other sources for the deleted videos) there are 12 deleted videos.** 

&#x200B;

In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA mind-control project was aimed at finding a ""truth serum"" to use on communist spies.

Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured. At least one man, civilian biochemist **Frank Olson**, who was working for the government, died as a result of the experiments. The project was finally exposed after investigations by the Rockefeller Commission.

# 4. [Operation Mockingbird](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_mediacontrol05.htm)

Also in the 1950s to '70s, [the CIA](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_cia.htm) paid a number of well-known domestic and foreign journalists (from [big-name media outlets](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mediacontrol.htm) like Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS and others) to publish CIA propaganda.

The CIA also reportedly funded at least one movie, the animated ""[Animal Farm](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/animalfarm.pdf),"" by **George Orwell**.

The Church Committee finally exposed the activities in 1975.

>In 1953, Joseph Alsop, then one of America's leading syndicated columnists, went to the Philippines to cover an election.  
   
He did not go because he was asked to do so by his syndicate. He did not go because he was asked to do so by the newspapers that printed his column. He went at the request of the CIA.  
Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past 25 years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists' relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap.  
   
Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services - from simple intelligence-gathering to serving as go-betweens with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors without portfolio for their country.  
   
Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists abroad.  
   
In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's leading news organizations.  
The history of the CIA's involvement with the American press continues to be shrouded by an official policy of obfuscation and deception for the following principal reasons:  
The use of journalists has been among the most productive means of intelligence-gathering employed by the CIA. Although the agency has cut back sharply on the use of reporters since 1973 (primarily as a result of pressure from the media), some journalists are still posted abroad.  
   
Further investigation into the matter, CIA officials say, would inevitably reveal a series of embarrassing relationships in the 1950's and 1960's with some of the most powerful organizations and individuals in American journalism.  
Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were:  
William Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System  
Henry Luce of Time Inc.  
Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times  
Barry Bingham Sr. of the Louisville Courier-Journal  
James Copley of the Copley News Services  
Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include:  
the American Broadcasting Company  
the National Broadcasting Company  
the Associated Press  
United Press International  
Reuters  
Hearst Newspapers  
Scripps-Howard  
Newsweek magazine  
the Mutual Broadcasting System  
the Miami Herald  
the old Saturday Evening Post  
New York Herald-Tribune  
By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with,  
the New York Times  
CBS  
Time Inc.  
\[...\]  
Appropriately, the CIA uses the term 'reporting' to describe much of what cooperating journalists did for the Agency.  
""We would ask them, 'Will you do us a favor?'"" said a senior CIA official.  
   
""'We understand you're going to be in Yugoslavia. Have they paved all the streets? Where did you see planes? Were there any signs of military presence? How many Soviets did you see? If you happen to meet a Soviet, get his name and spell it right... Can you set up a meeting for us? Or arrange a message?'""  
Many CIA officials regarded these helpful journalists as operatives: the journalists tended to see themselves as trusted friends of the Agency who performed occasional favors - usually without pay - in the national interest.  
\[...\]  
Two of the Agency's most valuable relationships in the 1960's, according to CIA officials, were with reporters who covered Latin America - Jerry O'Leary of the Washington Star and Hal Hendrix of Miami News, a Pulitzer Prize winner who became a high official of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.  
   
Hendrix was extremely helpful to the Agency in providing information about individuals in Miami's Cuban exile community.  
\[....\]

A note about Hendrix \- he was the one who **Seth Kantor**, reporting on the JFK assassination, was told to call for 'background' on Oswald after Oswald's arrest.

Hendrix, from Miami, had all the info on Oswald's pro-Castro leafleting activities in New Orleans, details about Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, etc.  


Only years later did Kantor realize the significance of a guy like Hendrix, CIA, having so much info on Oswald so soon after the assassination.

""Senator William Proxmire has pegged the number of employees of the federal intelligence community at 148,000 ... though Proxmire's number is itself a conservative one. The ""intelligence community"" is officially defined as including only those organizations that are members of the U.S. Intelligence Board (USIB); a dozen other agencies, charged with both foreign and domestic intelligence chores, are not encompassed by the term... The number of intelligence workers employed by the federal government is not 148,000, but some undetermined multiple of that number.""  
 **- Jim Hougan, Spooks**  
""For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government.... I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations.""

# 5. Manhattan Project

The Manhattan Project was the codename for a project conducted during World War II to [develop the first atomic bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project).

The project was led by the United States, and included participation from the United Kingdom and Canada. Formally designated as the Manhattan Engineer District (MED), it refers specifically to the period of the project from 1942-1946 under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the administration of General Leslie R. Groves.

The scientific research was directed by American physicist '**J**. **Robert OppenhMafia**.'

The project's roots lay in scientists' fears since the 1930s that Nazi Germany was also investigating nuclear weapons of its own. Born out of a small research program in 1939, the Manhattan Project eventually employed more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion ($22 billion in current value).  


It resulted in the creation of multiple production and research sites that operated in secret. With the total involved, this makes it one of the largest conspiracies in history.  Entire towns were built for short periods of time, employing people, all under secrecy and top national secrecy at that.

The government never admitted to it, the media never reported on it, and people had no idea for over 25 years.

Project research took place at over thirty sites across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium-production facility at what is now the Hanford Site, the uranium-enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The MED maintained control over U.S. weapons production until the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.",conspiracy,Alex Jones

You name it. **But this one is by far the most important.** Money and debt is the lifeblood of all economies and every society. With money created from nothing, you can corrupt on a massive scale, in every industry. You can bribe, extract massive capital from gov programs and projects, oversized state budgets, etc.

With debt created from NOTHING you can enslave nations for many generations. Just lend them FIAT $ and have military who is paid also with fiat $. 

What keeps fiat money system alive? Masses trust in them. Nothing more. The moment that trust is gone, its over. Rulers must establish fair monetary system backed by metals in order to run gov agencies, military, police, judges, etc.

If people would use gold/silver as currencies and store of wealth INSTEAD of digits in their banks, it will be impossible to run state deficits, distort economic life, and rage wars over petrodollar. 

Whats even better: when people save in gold and silver and NOT in fiat currencies (which lose purchasing power due to printing) - it will be much easier to save for a home WITHOUT mortgages. 

&#x200B;

Homes sweet homes....

&#x200B;

Example: in 1971 avg home in USA was 25k $. Median salary was $10k, from which half could be saved. This means 5 yrs of savings and home is yours without debt. Now? Avg home is 400k, salaries 44k, but you can save maybe 4k, 10k max. = 40 years to save for a home.  Assuming your wages keep up with home prices, and they dont.

&#x200B;

How Banking Cartel keeps monopoly over USD/EUR/GBP?

&#x200B;

They sell massive amounts of gold/silver futures contracts on Comex everytime these metals rise ""too much"" - so potential buyers are always discouraged. Just look at silver price for last 50 years! Everything rises just not silver! 

Also, silver has VAT tax in Europe and if you vault it (who wants to keep 50 or 100 kilos silver at home?) you must pay storage fees. When price is below 1980 high, most people (almost ALL) think its better to buy gov bonds or money market funds.

The Pressure? It came from Jared Holt, a Research Associate for [Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post_author/jared-holt/), which is an outfit that [is](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/about/):


>dedicated to monitoring and exposing the activities and rhetoric of right-wing activists and organizations in order to expose their extreme agenda. Our researchers monitor dozens of broadcasts, emails and websites, and use their expertise on right-wing movements to analyze and distill that information for media, allies and the general public. By shedding light on the activities of the right-wing movement, we help expose the risks its extreme and intolerant agenda presents to our country. We do not endorse the views of groups that we report on.


The [People For The American Way](http://www.pfaw.org/) (just read it a few times in your head – I bet it's not what you think it is – it was founded by Norman Lear in the early 1980s in opposition of the Moral Majority. [This link](http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cmte=People+for+the+American+Way) will tell you where they through their money regarding federal elections (both who they support and who they don't.


Back to Jared – he describes his motivation and tacticts in this [Salon piece](https://www.salon.com/2018/08/08/meet-jared-holt-the-guy-whos-getting-alex-jones-kicked-off-the-internet/):


>...In recent weeks, a group of progressive activists has dialed up efforts to pressure these distribution platforms to drop Infowars. **That pressure, which comes at a time when court proceedings against Jones have finally begun in earnest**, created the momentum that led to this decision. This has been mentioned in passing in much of the coverage, but these folks deserve much more credit and recognition for the work they've been doing in trying to fight right-wing disinformation campaigns.

>Salon spoke recently with Jared Holt, a researcher from Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way. Holt's work has been instrumental in getting social media and other internet platforms to give Infowars the boot. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

>[Author]: I follow you on Twitter and noticed that you seemed to be spearheading the effort to kick Alex Jones off Spotify. Am I right in this assumption?

>I first brought attention to the fact that Spotify was hosting Infowars’ programming and tweeted about it. That was amplified by the progressive group Sleeping Giants, which brought it into the national attention, from my relatively niche Twitter account. People were upset and threatened to boycott Spotify. That got the attention of reporters who asked Spotify about it. Then I also wrote an article laying out the case for why Infowars clearly violates Spotify’s own hosting rules.


There's a lot to unpack there already.


[Right Wing Watch](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/) is a Project of People For The American Way and describes itself as [follows](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/about/):


>Right Wing Watch is a project of People For the American Way (PFAW) dedicated to monitoring and exposing the activities and rhetoric of right-wing activists and organizations in order to expose their extreme agenda. **Our researchers monitor dozens of broadcasts, emails and websites, and use their expertise on right-wing movements to analyze and distill that information for media, allies and the general public.** By shedding light on the activities of the right-wing movement, we help expose the risks its extreme and intolerant agenda presents to our country.

Back to Salon.


>[Author]You work at Right Wing Watch and People for the American Way by tracking right-wing misinformation sites. Why is it so important to go after these guys? What danger do they present to the public?


>It's in the name of Infowars. It’s not an attempt at legitimate reporting. It's a, quote, ""war"" for your mind.

>**Unfortunately, their war for the American mind is to stuff it full of conspiracy theories. That ultimately debases people from reality and polarizes them to the extremes of right-wing politics. Historically, we’ve seen that can be very harmful for the vision of America as a free and open democracy.**

>I think it’s important to realize that people like Alex Jones are using these platforms in bad faith.

So, to review, we had Jared Holt, who is employed at Right Wing Watch, a Project of the People For The American Way, a liberal 501c3 who have to file their taxes publically. But there are other ways of regulating platforms, as reddit has a way of doing it (I believe I represent that function here at least half the week), as well as Twitter and Youtube, which we'll get to in a bit.

But first I want to direct your attention to Democracy Matters: A Strategic Plan For Action, [a leaked memo](https://freebeacon.com/politics/david-brock-memo-attack-trump/) from a Democracy Matters retreat in Florida last year.

>In the next four years, Media Matters will continue it's core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative disinformation: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country's information ecosystem. Here's what success will look like:


>Serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhabiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government will be exposed, discredited


>Internet and social media platforms, like Google and Facebook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists.


>Toxic alt-right social media fueled harassment campaigns that silence dissent and poison our national discourse will be punished and halted.


...sound familiar at all? Would Alex Jones have been deplatformed if he stuck to conspiracy theories and stayed out of political endorsements? Or was this all a stunt and he'll come out looking solid on the other side anyway? And what about other social media companies? We all know how reddit gins up their algorithms to weigh certain subs over others. Twitter has their own algorithms, as does Facebook, who also have moderators (of which they actually pay). But how much of this is automated? Once you get put on [a list](http://www.reddit.com/r/Masstagger) how do you get off? We'll get to that – and it seems easy to do if you have enough twitter followers.


On Page 8 (PDF warning) of a white paper that came out of Senator Mark Warner's (D-VA) office,  titled [Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4623358/PlatformPolicyPaper.pdf) states something that sounds familiar:

>Make platforms liable for state-law torts (defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts) for failure to take down deep fake or other manipulated audio/video content – due to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, internet intermediaries like social media platforms are immunized from state tort or criminal liability. However, the rise of technology like DeepFakes – sophisticated image and audio synthesis tools that can generate fake audio or video files falsely depicting someone saying or doing something – is poised to usher in an unprecedented wave of false and defamatory content, with state law-based torts (dignitary torts) potentially offering the only effective redress to victims. Dignatory torts such as defamation, invasion of privacy, false light, and public disclosure of private facts represent key mechanisms for victims to enjoin – and deter – sharing of this kind of content.


>Currently the onus is on victims to exhaustively search for, and report, this content to platforms who frequently take months to respond and who are under no obligation thereafter to proactively prevent the same content from being re-uploaded in the future. Many victims describe a 'whack-a-mole' situation.


>...thus, a revision of section 230 could provide the ability of users who have successfully proved that sharing of particular content by another user constituted a dignatory tort to give notice of this judgement to a platform; with this notice, platforms would be held liable in instances where they did not prevent the content in question from being re-uploaded in the future.


[Here is an example of a case regarding defamation that might be relevant](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnPMj3h2sdlCfL1e4nwm7d0jSCercoV1/view). [Here is another](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opX6d3Bycbl4sWGo8o37SuPcjxDanzjL/view).


So, here's how the government can do it. That's how some strange online army of DNC watchers can do it. On Youtube, you're ability to livestream and connection to the platform can be disconnected and a strike put on your account just for talking about wrongthink. **In real time** [Don't believe me?](https://twitter.com/h3h3productions/status/1028047008144080896?)

Thousands of civilians died during the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in DC.

Since that time we have been through 2 full 8 year presidencies, entered into several military engagements in the Middle East, not the least of which were Iraq and Afghanistan.  But also Yemen, Libya, Syria, and a military raid in Pakistan to assassinate Bin Laden.

The USA PATRIOT Act was passed in the immediate wake, and security at airports grew proportionately.  

In the wake of the attack came conspiracy theories, Alex Jones rose to prominence calling 9/11 an ""inside job"".

The Attack spawned the War on Terror, which has shaped politics for both parties, and encouraged military activities in the middle east, which became flash points in the elections of 2004, and especially 2008.

And I've watched both the Russian state media, and feel as if I have a good feel of what narrative they want, and I've watched and read Western media, and while it's obvious that their media is more open, there still is political posturing occurring on that side as well. 

I feel that one of the most overlooked parts of this whole story is that Putin wants to act as if there is Western aggression. He wants there to be a new cold war. Why? Well Russia's economy wasn't every strong to begin with. It's still basically a 2nd World country (Or maybe a 3rd world nation) the average monthly wage there is around 700$ and the average lifespan is like 60. Corruption is rampant everywhere, and one can be faced with having to bribe people on everything from getting admitted to a college to wanting to open a shop.  Remember, this type of corruption was the same thing that created the tipping point situation in Ukraine.  Therefore it was immediately important to stress that the revolution in Ukraine wasn't about people standing up to a corrupt system and removing an absolutely corrupt leader, but instead a violent coup perpetuated by Nazis funded by the US. This may sound like something from Alex Jones, but it's actually a pretty common belief. At this point, in their minds, pretty much everything bad that happens involving Russias is the work of Western covert agents. The Tartar who was tortured and killed in Crimea for being against Putin? Most believe he was killed by Ukrainian nationalists trying to frame Russians and make them look bad. At this point everything is the fault of the West, and that's just what Putin wants, and needs to stay in power. Seriously, you wouldn't believe the amount of anti-American and anti-European attitudes on Russian state media (which is now the only media) .

On top of that there are serious ethnic problems in Russia between native Russians and ""Kavkaz"" (non natives.. In their eyes at least) . Then of course there are obvious problems between Russians and Chechens, Ingush, Dagestanis, and Central Asians. Putin needs to ""Unite"" the country somehow, and The West is the perfect target. 

And lastly, Russia is simply an incredibly depressing place. Don't get me wrong it's totally unique and badass in a multitude of ways, and has an amazing history. But at the same time, it's just fucking depressing. There's a reason why a lot of people with money or upward mobility are fleeing the country, and that's because there simply isn't a lot of opportunity. But instead of blaming the oligarchs in power, you guessed it, the blame is on The West, once again. 

So, in my opinion the best tactic would be for US and their European Allies to engage in would be one that doesn't give Putin what he wants (which I believe they currently are doing). However, I don't know a viable alternative to sanctions, and travel bans. However I feel that at the same time they will feed into the same propaganda outlets which want to shift the blame for all their ills on America and Obama.

TLDR: Putin needs the US and an ""Us vs Them"" narrative to push in order to keep his power and his people in check. Without the bogeyman of the West, the people may start blaming their own leaders, and their own government for the problems in their lives. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Alex Jones

Kavanaugh serves on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which often rules on major challenges to federal laws and policies. If confirmed, he would make the Supreme Court solidly conservative, joining Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch — providing a five-vote majority.

Randazza, a First Amendment lawyer and free speech advocate. I write about the First Amendment and law on CNN, Popehat, and Twitter. Lately, I’ve been known for representing Alex Jones, Vermin Supreme, Andrew Anglin, Lisa Bloom, adult entertainment companies, and any number of controversial clients. In 2013, I helped draft the current Anti-SLAPP statute in Nevada, which has been called the strongest in the country. 

Popular speech rarely ever gets questioned, but when an unpopular speaker gets attention, the censorship pitchforks come out. When the law is used to punish any kind of speech – whether it comes from neo-nazis, pornographers, or whatever you’d call Vermin Supreme – we all lose a bit of our freedom. 

My job is not only to protect my clients’ First Amendment rights in court – it’s also to protect your rights when you write a review online, report on the news, or exercise your god-given right to call someone a douche nozzle on Twitter.

For those of you not aware, its a conspiracy theory that goes back to the Kennedy assassination that purports there to be a 'shadow government' that seeks to unite the nation under a one world order. My parents used to be fun-loving conservatives, watching Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter, you know, the *normal-kind of crazy Republican stuff*. My parents used to have very strong opinions about the justifiability of America's wars, and always pushed back against those who disparage America. 

Recently they've done a kind of 180. Or 150. I am not too sure.
What is clear is that they don't trust the government more than ever. Republicans are known for not trusting the government generally, but most of them still have strong trust in the military. Now they side with the liberals in reducing the strength of the military and ceasing intervention around the world. Maybe that's a good thing, right?

In some ways, they've become even more liberal than me. Per example, GMO regulations, and other ecobiological (but not global warming for some reason) phenomenon have become central to their obsession. Down with Monsanto, IP rights on human DNA, etc etc.

**I would applaud them their recent dramatic changes in opinion if it did not come at a seemingly high price.** Normally I could stand going home and having to listen to Fox News in the background while I study or read. But now my parents seem more paranoid and obsessive than ever. 

My Mom wants to put all her assets into gold. She only buys organic non-GMO food, and refuse to drink faucet water unless its been filtered twice for radioactivity. Last week my parents sent me a geiger counter (a geiger counter! do you know what that is?) much to my amusement. They also think that the government sends around planes to spray carcinogenic material and poison the water with fluorine.

I tell you this not to bore you with my trifles, but because I think this might be happening elsewhere. My parents think we are heading for some kind of nuclear war, or other apocolpytic nonsense. This sort of panicking irrational fear seems to be playing a part on religious paranoia that we are entering the end times. The dangerous part is that I don't know what the leaders of this movement are working towards, and if they perhaps are so deluded they believe the nonsense themselves. 

And now I open up the discussion to you. I would like to hear if anyone else has had any similar experiences, and what you might be doing about it. 

TL;DR Parents went from being Republicans to overly obsessive conspiracy theorists via infowars. Not sure what it means.",politics,Alex Jones

0,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,96.0,5bgwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/,15.0,1478453724.0,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites?

Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it?

Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

>This is being equation group pitchimpair (redirector) keys, many missions into your networks is/was coming from these ip addresses. Is being unfortunate no peoples is already owning eqgrp_auction_file. Auction file is having tools for to making connect to these pitchimpairs. Maybe tools no more installed? Maybe is being cleaned up? To peoples is being owner of pitchimpair computers, don’t be looking for files, rootkit will self destruct. Be making cold forensic image. @GCHQ @Belgacom TheShadowBrokers is making special effort not to using foul language, bigotry, or making any funny. Be seeing if NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX is making stories about now? Maybe political hacks is being more important?

Again, the usual old spiel of brave hackers fighting ""USSA""/""Amerikansky"" ""corruption"". It's gotten quite repetitive by now.

Bizarrely, they began posting Bill Clinton and Lorreta Lynch erotic fan fiction at some point:
