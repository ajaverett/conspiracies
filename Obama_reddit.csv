0,"Dear Trump: the bill is now on your desk. Veto the shit out of it to protect the privacy of people YOU work for. Grow some balls and stand up to the swamp you supposedly were going to drain. If you don't, we WILL fight back",16894.0,6248nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6248nr/dear_trump_the_bill_is_now_on_your_desk_veto_the/,2420.0,1490757683.0,"This needs to be said.

Edit: to all those who think I am still a Trump supporter, just so you all know, I WAS a Trump supporter, but have become extremely disillusioned with him and his administration. I plead to other Trump supporters to open your eyes and mind about him, being a little more skeptical about who he is, and his actions. I have learned he is a CONMAN, and he is no different from previous presidents before him, including Obama, Bush, and Clinton, PROBABLY worse.


We must stand up to him. We must not blindly obey him just because he said he was going to drain the swamp and you think he's playing 420D backgammon Chinese checkers. It's all bullshit, he's full of bullshit, and you all need to OPEN your eyes.

This is r/conspiracy for fuck's sake, NOT r/the_scumbag, or any other biased subreddit.

Be skeptical of ALL authority.


Edit2: I never voted for Trump. I stopped supporting him before election day. I bought into his bullshit during the beginning of his campaign when he was promising to drain the swamp, but I eventually realized how much we've been played and DUPED by this fuckwad.

1,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15928.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

Page 34

-	Jane Doe 3 and 4 can’t join under rule 21, rule 15 is the proper procedure. 

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

Page 38

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

intervention.

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out.

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later? 

-	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.

-	Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 

-	A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

First of all, many thanks to the moderators of r/Conspiracy for giving us the space to present the proof that there was no Russian hack and take any questions people may have about it.

Here's some context about who I am and what I've done, taken from my Wikipedia page.

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.  
>  
>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.  
>  
>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).  
>  
>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Trailblazer was a modification of ThinThread, removing the encryption and auditing aspects, while expanding the mass data collection. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

[In 2017 I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at President Donald Trump's request to talk about my evidence that there was no ""Russian Hack""](https://larouchepac.com/20190506/former-nsa-technical-director-william-binney-must-testify-congress-expose-big-lie-russia). He promised me follow up meetings that never happened, and I would suspect the President was ever briefed.

Three key points that are essential to know.

1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

3.) The NSA would have known the hack was taking place, and would have direct evidence of it. We know this thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied.

If we could just stop all the shenanigans and start working together instead of against each other, helping fellow beings instead of kicking while they are down, we would all be in a far better place.

We are, in essence, all the same, just different individuations of this essence and some of those individuations need more help than others to realize this.

Why do so many people fall for the campaign of hate all the time and don't just stop and think for a moment? 

Property,  Religion,  Borders, all those tools are being used to give you a reason to hate. 

If you truly feel superior over another being, then give that superiority a good use and help the other being achieve a similar state. For every service you do for another being is also a service for yourself, but in a positive way. 

All this hate and anger have gotten way out of hand.

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses, I hope that all of you who haven't found the positivity will find it soon. 

I feel like I have to explain a little bit more:

What I meant to say was don't get caught up too much in ""the system"" just live a positive life and be the beacon of light for others. You always get what you give, so if you do not only speak in a positive way, but honestly act positive without expecting anything in return, life will give it back to you in a positive way.

Edit2: A lot.of positive people here, I am really enjoying it! 
According to other responses it seems like I am a paid jewish fascist communist hippie whore who supports Obama and Trump and promotes an NWO and deserves to get shot in the genitals.
This is just what I meant by saying the rage towards other parties has gotten out of control. People, you are better than that!",conspiracy,Obama
18,An Open Letter to Everyone who has forever Mocked us Conspiracy Theorists,3377.0,conhke,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/conhke/an_open_letter_to_everyone_who_has_forever_mocked/,1397.0,1565470350.0,"You called us names. You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Obama

21,Did the US have a black president for 8 years before Trump?,3181.0,l05x5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/l05x5z/did_the_us_have_a_black_president_for_8_years/,1677.0,1611010167.0,"Did the timeline change? I'm just trying to understand how a country, the most powerful in  the world, dominantly elected a black man to the highest position of power in the country and then within months of leaving office concluded that the biggest threat to the country was racism and white supremacy? 

I am not American. I'm trying to understand. Obama won by a significant margin didn't he? And he won twice and was the President for 8 years. And was celebrated world wide for the progressive victory. So how did that happen in a country who's biggest threat and social issue is racism? Compared to which country is the racism in the United States worse?

Do people really believe that half the country is actively racist and is openly colluding and working to oppress minorities based on ignorant beliefs? How did Obama ever get into office? How come the government wasn't dismantled or destroyed when he was elected?

And another question I have. Once the opportunity came to elect a new non-racist president in the United States came around why did the party making racism it's main issue vote in an old white person? Like I mean a wonderbread, mayonnaise loving white person? Why do people believe Donald Trump, a man celebrated around the country while Obama was in office, is less of a racist threat than Joe Biden? Both are white aren't they? Both are white men? 

Are there no potential black candidates in the country anymore? Is it racism that caused Joe Biden to be voted in?

** Thanks everyone, the comments are very encouraging. Sounds like the parties and media (big surprise) do not truly or factually represent what is happening in the US on the ground with the citizens. Peace and Love to everyone. Breathe and respect!

** some people have pointed out how some ignorant ideas are expressed in this post and I can see and agree. That is how communication can work. Others have expressed anger that really appears to be rooted in hatred and it really demonstrates what is so confusing. You cannot out hate hate. And so if you are being motivated into hating someone, something, some group then understand your message is lost. You become convinced that the only way to ""win"" is to violently dominate those who don't agree. Racism without hatred is a stereotype. And we all make generalizations about groups of people due to lack of information. Share information without hate. it would turn this world around if Americans could come together in peace, stop the wars and killing together. Stop what you are doing as a country around the world that doesn't promote peace and unity and then you will heal internally. It is the same for every country but often it seems like there is more opportunity for the US to do this. There is more influence on the world.

*** Racism exists around the world. Racism exists in the US and people suffer it every single day. For many people suffering racism it is the most important and pressing issue. But not everyone. I still have many of the same questions. Looking for answers from Americans. Obviously not everyone agrees! It is hatred that makes people support the military violently dominating killing and destroying people and families from other countries. No good comes from dropping bombs. Speak out against nationalistic violent domination and calls for ending racism is delivered with more authority. If you support or defend or rationalize the killing of people in other countries by your country's military you are by definition an ignorant racist. Don't whine about immigration policy without screaming about the ongoing violent domination done in your name around the world. If you are white just stop with the virtue signaling. You want to share your privilege and show you understand? Then start screaming for peace until every single bomb has stopped. If white people are in control of the US then the military policy is their greatest shame and seems to be a policy both parties share except in presentation and pandering. Black people in Libya, Iraq, Africa have all been murdered by US military. Muslims have been murdered for 3 decades by the US military. 

And the reason white people will make a bigger deal over immigration policy than war in the middle east is because they are scared to stand up. They are scared to lose the REAL privilege they have. Being vocal about immigration and racism is EASY for white people in America. Being pro-peace is not.  Because if you want to see someone marginalized and destroyed then watch an influential white person who stands up against the military policy of all parties. I hope and pray Democrats find their roots in a real peace movement and start doing the hard work. And I hope the trump supporters who are anti-war support them 100%.

It's like when your mom would guilt trip you into eating a bowl of cold brussel sprouts & beans because some kid in Africa somewhere was starving to death. It's a fucking fallacy.

b-b-b-but that's actual real oppression! /s

No that's just the oppression you're seeing on the big screen now because the whole fucking media is blasting the Ukraine/Russia situation to you bottom feeders 24/7. As if oppression, suffering, and war WEREN'T happening up until the very moment TPTB (The Powers That Be) started spoon feeding you Russia-hate porn 5 days ago about THIS particular conflict.

b-b-b-but Russia is a real dictatorship you have 1st world problems! /s

Yet in Russia, people who didn't take a Covid-19 Vaccine can still LEAVE RUSSIA. I'm a fucking CANADIAN who's trapped in Canada and can't leave the country without a vaccine passport. How the FUCK is that NOT tyranny? Unvaxxed Russians can fly out of Russia but Canadians can't fly out of Canada? Tell me again how much worse Russia is than us /s

b-b-b-but Putin has protestors beaten in the streets! /s

And how are we in Canada above that when Trudeau did the same thing last weekend? Canadian's were beaten in the streets and hauled off to the bin in Ottawa for having views deemed ""unacceptable"" by the man in charge.

b-b-b-but the vaccine mandates are being removed on March 1st anyway! /s

And even if they remove SOME OF THEM on the provincial level does that mean we just ROLL OVER and let our Prime minister keep up the travel bans? As I already stressed, we have LITERAL travel bans on our own citizens, yeah kind of sounds like fucking TYRANNY doesn't it?

The point is, you should stop shaming us just because ""rEaL tYrAnNy"" is happening on the other side of the world. Where were you fucks when Obama bombed the living hell out of Afghanistan? Where were you fucks when Trudeau painted his face BLACK and stuck his tongue out with a banana in his hand singing ""DAYOOO"" (or honestly during any of his other million scandals).

But most importantly, where the FUCK were you when the Canadian government decided it would be a good idea to ban your fellow citizens from travelling across our great country, or when Canadian universities & colleges banned and de-enrolled their unvaccinated students on a split second decision (who PAID for their educations and got ROBBED).

Where were you all this time? You don't have to stare at your computer screens and seethe about Russia/Ukraine to feel like you're united against tyranny when it's already in the atmosphere around you. Beaten protestors, frozen bank accounts, emergency orders, digital vaccine QR codes, travel bans, the thousand lockdowns that bankrupted people...should I go on?

- In its self-described ""pied piper"" strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new ""mainstream of the Republican Party"" in order to try to increase Clinton's chances of winning, telling the press to take Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruz seriously, rather than marginalizing them. http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

The mod team is honored to announce another in our continuing series of AMA (ask me anything) sessions on the subreddit.

For this round, our guest will be NSA Whistleblower William Binnney (verified via /u/WilliamBinney) and the AMA will take place on Thursday, August 27th, at Noon eastern time.

Mr. Binney was kind enough to provide photo verification for this AMA which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/F1IHym8).

This AMA is of particular interest as Mr. Binney's AMA earlier this week-on another subreddit-[was censored mid way through his scheduled time slot.](https://twitter.com/Burke4Senate/status/1298318463610560512?s=20)

For those unaware;

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA)[4] and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.

>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. 

>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).

>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

As to the issue of the 2016 DNC hack, Mr. Binney has the following to say in the text of [his initial (censored) AMA](https://archive.is/RMhh3);

>Remember when emails released by Wikileaks proved that the DNC rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders? And everyone claimed that the Russians had hacked the DNC?

>There's only one problem. There was no hack.

>It was an internal leak.

>Here's my proof

>It boils down to these three key points:

>1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

>2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

>3.)The NSA would've known the hack was taking place, thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied

>In October 2017, at the specific request of President Donald Trump, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at that time CIA Director, and presented my evidence that the ""Russian hack"" never was. Did Trump ever receive that evidence?

>So, Ask me anything!

King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  


Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty” - Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/watch-how-the-cia-helped-make-zero-dark-thirty/ (http://archive.is/zIRh0)

**Surveillance**:

- ""Four Central Intelligence Agency officers were embedded with the New York Police Department in the decade after Sept. 11, 2001, including one official who helped conduct surveillance operations in the United States, according to a newly disclosed C.I.A. inspector general’s report. That officer believed there were “no limitations” on his activities, the report said, because he was on an unpaid leave of absence, and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A. Another embedded C.I.A. analyst — who was on its payroll — said he was given 'unfiltered' police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence, the C.I.A. report said."" https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html (http://archive.is/yKwIa)

- Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.
Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.
With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.
You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""
""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.
Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.
You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.
This all happened in the country where I live.
You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.
Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?
Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?
I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.
I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.",conspiracy,Obama

I’m only doing this because I care about humanity, my future, my children’s future, oppressed people around the globe, and really the survival of our species in a time when more money and resources is dedicated to weaponry and AI/Tech than ever before.

The first rule you need to know is conspiracy theorist was a weaponized term by the CIA to make people fall in line, and ridicule anyone who opposed the status quo narrative. Politicians LOVE this term, because it enables their goals while simultaneously encouraging you to mock anyone who speaks out.

The second rule is everything you have heard regarding conspiracies, while it contains falsehoods, is relatively true in one way or another. This is just a Reddit post intended to point you in the right direction so I won’t make a super in depth post but I encourage all to do their due diligence and research these subjects, as I’ve learned it’s the only way the majority will reach *the truth* anyways. 

Freemasonry, CIA, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, United Nations, Vatican, FBI, NSA, Mossad, M16, Federal Reserve, CCP, etc.

Learn right now that there are people in this world so powerful they influence everything you see and hear on a daily basis. The hardest part to accepting this all, is like The Matrix Movie on a tiny scale. Everything is fake, manufactured, planned, and coordinated. 


“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812).

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions) 

Bush = evil. Clinton = evil. Obama = evil. Older Bush = evil.   HERES the difference.. Trump = somewhat disrespectful idiot who is not a career politician or ties to public office (senate/house/president/VP) but actually likes America and opposes the Globalist agenda. 

Twitter is compromised. Reddit is compromised. Facebook is compromised. Even this sub = compromised. Operation Mockingbird is in full effect every day in here to sway public opinion. ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people. 

“I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.” - Harry S Truman, President of the United States.

Love yourself. Love your neighbor. Love and peace is the only thing that can conquer all. Educate yourself. Educate others. Understand atheism is a carefully crafted lie to make you believe this is all there is to life. Understand we have a purpose. There is more than meets the eye in this materialistic and corporatist society we currently inhabit, and all truths will eventually rise to the surface. Don’t lose faith.

Edit: to understand how this sub is compromised, look at almost every top comment. It’s not discussing the material, or the main parts of what’s being implied here, but rather every comment is nitpicking anything I said about Trump, and only Trump. In my original post, I claim Trump is a bad person. An imbecile. Can’t say a speech to save his life. Disrespectful. Just a non intelligent human being. Nor does he do honorable things like release tax returns or present real forward thinking ideas or policies. I end it with acknowledging *no matter what candidate takes office the next 4 years will be hell.* However, the shill crowd immediately comes in and glosses over the MAIN parts of what I’m saying here, which is conspiracy theories related to government and politics are for the most part true, to research agencies and institutions that contribute to the stripping of your rights in modern day propaganda in broad daylight, especially the CIA.",conspiracy,Obama

The release today is even more revealing than the handwritten notes released last night; and specifically President Obama’s “by the book” statement on January 5, 2017, takes on an entirely new light.  They may not realize it yet, but this release implicates Obama.

Within [the release](https://t.co/W1M33J49Tf?amp=1) we discover an “Electronic Communication” or “EC” from the Washington FBI field office recommending to close the FBI investigation of General Flynn on January 4, 2017, due to “no derogatory information.” However, FBI Agent Peter Strzok immediately responds to the FBI team \[main headquarters\] saying: “don’t do it yet’… and the plot unfolds.

There are FBI codenames within the release that need some explanation prior to review:

* **Crossfire Hurricane** (CH) is the overall investigation that began in July 2016
* **Crossfire Typhoon** (CT) is George Papadopoulos.
* **Crossfire Razor** (CR) is Michael Flynn.
* **Cross Wind** is still unknown. \[Could be a person, or a subset of the case\]

Let’s take a walk through the information starting with the FBI electronic communication.

First it is valuable to note three points from the first page:

1. “DOJSCO” – The Special Counsel Office had this information from the outset.  That means everyone in/around the Mueller investigation already knew this information.  That also means that Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein was aware of it.
2. Pay close attention to the dates.  This EC was written on January 4, 2017.  Dates are critical.  When you compare the text messages and emails from Peter Strzok and other participants always refer to the dates to tell the big story.
3. Note the framework for the investigation itself was centered around Michael Flynn violating FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) laws based on a fraudulent premise of Flynn working for Russian interests.  The FBI using FARA is a critical point.  FARA was used as the primary justification by the DOJ and FBI for all political surveillance.

The FBI Washington Field Office says they are going to close the investigation of General Flynn because there is **no derogatory information** as a result of multiple investigative inquires:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ofl7jrq2ip51.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a58a3ff1f0b200849bbf26468b1ebd5615eab85

The EC document then describes their work with Confidential Human Source (CHS) Stefan Halper.  Interestingly, Halper lied to the FBI and told them he had attended an event with Michael Flynn in Moscow and was a direct eye-witness.  “During the debriefing the CTH relayed an incident s/he witnessed”…. Halper never attended the Moscow event; he lied to the FBI.

https://preview.redd.it/j16i4ffv2ip51.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4a4d3d73d1b2b9ad9c50bce15e5e38b7a62bbf2

The EC notes the FBI is closing this investigation.  However, Peter Strzok goes bananas and immediately starts texting FBI officials to keep the investigation open….

https://preview.redd.it/btbelbgz2ip51.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ea6c16cd786da0c5d06cde097a31dd17d7262b9a

Which leads to a 2:22pm message where Peter Strzok notes “7th floor involved”.  That means FBI Director James Comey is now engaged on the issue.

James Comey being actively engaged is important.  Previously Comey said he was unaware of what they were doing…  Additionally this text and activity is January 4, 2017.

The very next day, January 5th, James Comey goes to the White House for a meeting with President Obama and Vice-President Biden.

January 5th is [the White House meeting](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2019/11/29/the-mysteriously-redacted-paragraph-700-days-since-lindsey-graham-outlined-susan-rice-cya-memo-and-dc-doesnt-want-answers/) where National Security Advisor Susan Rice, FBI Director James Comey (Crossfire Hurricane), and Deputy AG Sally Yates (Flynn FARA) are talking to President Obama about the status of the Flynn FBI investigation and President Obama says “by the book”.

**SIDEBAR on THIS ISSUE**: This long forgotten [letter](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161) from Susan Rice’s lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler (who was also the former White House Counsel to President Obama).  Notice that in Ruemmler’s letter she specifically says the January 5th meeting was about Flynn:

>*\[*[*Feb 23, 2018*](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161)*\] The memorandum to file drafted by Ambassador Rice memorialized an important national security discussion between President Obama and the FBI Director and the Deputy Attorney General. President Obama and his national security team were justifiably concerned about potential risks to the Nation’s security from sharing highly classified information about Russia with certain members of the Trump transition team,* ***particularly Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn****.*  
*\[…\] While serving as National Security Advisor, Ambassador Rice was not briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and she later learned of the fact of this investigation from Director Comey’s subsequent public testimony.*

How could Ms. Susan Rice be aware of a “national security compromise”, “particularly surrounding Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn” after a “briefing by the FBI”, if she was “not briefed on the existence of an FBI investigation”?  With all of this information, these stories are falling apart.

The police and surveillance state predicted in the forward-looking 1940s classic ""1984"" by George Orwell, has slowly, but steadily, come to fruition. However, like a frog sitting idly in a pan of steadily-warming water, too many Americans still seem unaware that the slow boil of big government is killing their constitutional liberties.

The latest sign of this stealth takeover of civil rights and freedom was epitomized in recent Senate testimony by FBI Director James Comey, who voiced his objections to civilian use of encryption to protect personal data – information the government has no automatic right to obtain.

As reported by The New American, Comey testified that he believes the government's spy and law enforcement agencies should have unfettered access to everything Americans may store or send in electronic format: On computer hard drives, in so-called i-clouds, in email and in text messaging – for our own safety and protection. Like many in government today, Comey believes that national security is more important than constitutional privacy protections or, apparently, due process. After all, aren't criminals the only ones who really have anything to hide?

In testimony before a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee entitled ""Going Dark: Encryption, Technology, and the Balance Between Public Safety and Privacy"" Comey said that in order to stay one step ahead of terrorists, as well as international and domestic criminals, Uncle Sam's various spy and law enforcement agencies should have access to available technology used to de-encrypt protected data. Also, he believes the government should be the final arbiter deciding when decryption is necessary.

What could go wrong there?

##Government, at all levels, is responsible

During the hearing, TNA reported, technology experts warned the panel that giving the FBI limitless access to the personal electronic data of Americans would open it up to exploitation by ""bad actors."" But Comey was having none of that.

""It is clear that governments across the world, including those of our closest allies, recognize the serious public safety risks if criminals can plan and undertake illegal acts without fear of detection,"" he told the committee.

""Are we comfortable with technical design decisions that result in barriers to obtaining evidence of a crime?""

So, in essence, Comey – like many before him, especially since the global war on terror was launched – believes that, in the name of national security Americans ought to give up more of their individual and constitutional rights because that's the only way we can be adequately protected.

Perhaps realizing that his Senate hearing testimony was public, Comey gave the Constitution a passing glance, noting that the government should respect the ""requirements and safeguards of the laws"" and the country's founding document. However, as Americans now know, spy agencies during the past two presidential administrations have been tasked increasingly with conducting warrantless, unchecked surveillance of Americans' electronic data and communications.

But all of this is not on men like Comey and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Congress bears its share of responsibility, too.

##This is the way it is – shut up and take it

When such activities of the National Security Agency were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, many in the media and among the American electorate were quick to blame the agency, as if it was somehow acting out of rogue instinct.

The reality is, however, that the agency is tasked to perform its duties– either by statutory law (think the USA Patriot Act) or by presidential directive (think Bush's order after 9/11 to [conduct warrantless surveillance](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html?_r=1)).

""We are not asking to expand the government's surveillance authority, but rather we are asking to ensure that we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that Congress has provided to us to keep America safe,"" Comey said during the Senate hearing.

What does all this mean? It simply means that at every level, government considers its own citizens hostile.

by [Zac Kriegman](https://kriegman.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile?utm_source=%2Fprofile%2F27261592-zac-kriegman&utm_medium=reader2)

Until recently, I was a director of data science at Thomson Reuters, one of the biggest news organizations in the world. It was my job, among other things, to sift through reams of numbers and figure out what they meant.

About a year ago, I stumbled on a really big story. It was about black Americans being gunned down across the country and the ways in which we report on that violence. We had been talking nonstop about race and police brutality, and I thought: *This is a story that could save lives. This is a story that has to be told.*

But when I shared the story with my coworkers, my boss chastised me, telling me expressing this opinion could limit my ability to take on leadership roles within the company. Then I was maligned by my colleagues. And then I was fired.

This is the story Reuters didn’t want to tell. 

I had been at Thomson Reuters for over six years—most recently, leading a team of data scientists applying new machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to our legal, tax and news data. We advised any number of divisions inside the company, including Westlaw, an online legal research service used by most every law firm in the country, and the newsroom, which reaches [an audience of one billion](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/reuters-news-agency/fact-sheet/reuters-fact-sheet.pdf) every day around the globe. I briefed the Chief Technology Officer regularly. My total annual compensation package exceeded $350,000.

In 2020, I started to witness the spread of a new ideology inside the company. On our internal collaboration platform, the Hub, people would post about “the self-indulgent tears of white women” and the danger of “White Privilege glasses.” They’d share articles with titles like “Seeing White,” “Habits of Whiteness” and “How to Be a Better White Person.” There was fervent and vocal support for Black Lives Matter at every level of the company. No one challenged the racial essentialism or the groupthink.

This concerned me. I had been following the academic research on BLM for years (for example, [here](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1007/s10940-019-09438-5), [here](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2019.101653#), [here](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1177/1948550618775108) and [here](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1547269)), and I had come to the conclusion that the claim upon which the whole movement rested—that police more readily shoot black people—was false. 

The data was unequivocal. It showed that, if anything, police were slightly *less* likely to use lethal force against black suspects than white ones. 

Statistics from [the most complete database of police shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) (compiled by The Washington Post) indicate that, over the last five years, police have fatally shot 39 percent more unarmed whites than blacks. Because there are roughly six times as many white Americans as black Americans, that figure should be closer to 600 percent, BLM activists (and their allies in [legacy media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/11/arent-more-white-people-than-black-people-killed-by-police-yes-but-no/)) insist. The fact that it’s not—that there’s more than a 500-percentage point gap between reality and expectation—is, they say, evidence of the bias of police departments across the United States. 

But it’s more complicated than that. Police are authorized to use lethal force only when they believe a suspect poses a grave danger of harming others. So, when it comes to measuring cops’ racial attitudes, it’s important that we compare apples and apples: Black suspects who pose a grave danger and white suspects who do the same. 

Unfortunately, we don’t have reliable data on the racial makeup of dangerous suspects, but we do have a good proxy: The number of people in each group who murder police officers. 

According to [calculations](https://patterico.substack.com/p/police-shootings-are-said-to-be-disproportionate?s=r) (published by Patrick Frey, Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County) based on [FBI data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2019/topic-pages/tables/table-42.xls), black Americans account for 37 percent of those who murder police officers, and 34 percent of the unarmed suspects killed by police. Meanwhile, whites make up 42.7 percent of cop killers and 42 percent of the unarmed suspects shot by police—meaning whites are killed by police at a 7 percent higher rate than blacks.

If you broaden the analysis to include armed suspects, the gap is even wider, with whites shot at a 70 percent higher rate than blacks. [Other experts in the field concur](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/21/police-kill-more-whites-than-blacks-but-minority-d/) that, in relation to the number of police officers murdered, whites are shot disproportionately.

There has been only [one study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22399/w22399.pdf) that has looked at the rate at which police use lethal force in similar circumstances across racial groups. It was conducted by the wunderkind Harvard economist Roland Fryer, who is black, grew up poor, had his fair share of run-ins with the police and, initially, supported BLM. In 2016, Fryer, hoping to prove the BLM narrative, conducted a rigorous study that controlled for the circumstances of shootings—and was shocked to find that, while blacks and Latinos were likelier than whites to experience some level of police force, they were, if anything, slightly *less likely* to be shot. The study generated enormous controversy. (In 2018, Fryer was suspended from Harvard over dubious allegations of sexual harassment.)

Unfortunately, because the BLM narrative was now conventional wisdom, police departments, under intense scrutiny from left-wing politicians and activists, scaled back patrols in dangerous neighborhoods filled with vulnerable black residents. This led to soaring violence in many communities and thousands of needless deaths—otherwise known as the Ferguson Effect.

For many months I stayed silent. I continued to read Reuters’ reporting on the movement, and started to see how the company’s misguided worldview about policing and racism was distorting the way we were reporting news stories to the public. 

In one [story](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-protests/despite-trumps-law-and-order-rhetoric-protesters-wont-back-down-idUSKBN2621C3), Reuters reported on police in Kenosha, Wisconsin shooting a black man, Jacob Blake, in the back—but failed to mention that they did so only after he grabbed a knife and looked likely to lunge at them.

In [another story](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police/protests-looting-erupt-in-minneapolis-over-racially-charged-killing-by-police-idUSKBN2332G9), Reuters referred “to a wave of killings of African-Americans by police using unjustified lethal force,” despite a lack of statistical evidence that such a wave of police killings had taken place. (In 2020, 18 unarmed black Americans were killed by police, according to The Washington Post database.)

And in yet [another](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-immunity-scotus-snapshot-idUSKBN22K1AM), Reuters referred to the shooting of Michael Brown as one of a number of “egregious examples of lethal police violence,” despite the fact that an investigation conducted by the Justice Department—then run by Barack Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder—had cleared the police officer in question of all wrongdoing.  

A pattern was starting to emerge: Reporters and editors would omit key details that undermined the BLM narrative. More important than reporting accurately was upholding—nurturing—that storyline. 

At some point, the organization went from ignoring key facts to just reporting lies. When Donald Trump declared, in July 2020, that the police kill more white than black people—this is true—Reuters, in its dispatch, [repeated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-trump/trump-downplays-police-violence-against-black-people-says-more-white-people-killed-idUSKCN24F2WQ) the false claim that blacks “are shot at a disproportionate rate.” In December 2020, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-immunity-race-specialrepor-idCAKBN28X1FT) that black Americans “are more likely to be killed by police,” citing a 2019 National Academy of Sciences study that, our reporters claimed, found that black men were 2.5 times likelier than white men to be killed by police. In fact, the only rigorous study to examine the likelihood of police use of force—Roland Fryer’s—found that police, as mentioned, were less likely to use lethal force against black Americans.

All this left me deeply unsettled: It was bad for Reuters, which was supposed to be objective and withhold judgment. It was bad for our readers, who were being misinformed. And it was bad for black people in rough neighborhoods, where local officials, prompted to take action by reporting like ours and the public outcry it triggered, were doing things like defunding the police.

Reuters, which is headquartered in London, is hardly the biggest news organization in the United States, but its stories are published in newspapers across the country and read by millions of Americans. It influences our perception of reality. It *matters*. I didn’t know what to do. I thought I should speak up, but I wanted to preserve my career. My wife, Cynthia, and I started arguing. I’d stay up late into the night compulsively reading the news and studies about policing. I took a two-month leave of absence while I agonized over what to do. 

While I was gone, I started [writing a post](https://kriegman.substack.com/p/post-leading-to-termination-blm-falsehoods) about the disconnect between what we thought was true and what was actually happening. I wasn’t sure what I planned to do with it. Maybe I would share it. More likely it would just be a kind of therapy, a chance for me to work through some of these issues.

In my post, I examined all the data I had compiled, and I cited the Justice Department’s [National Crime Victimization Survey](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/revcoa18.pdf) and several academic studies (see, for example, [here](https://www.police1.com/officer-safety/articles/unarmed-but-still-dangerous-the-facts-behind-some-ois-headlines-17xQeMIyZn1pR1yK/), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235216300010), [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690473) and [here](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11524-020-00430-0?sharing_token=KmsF70XVotW0LWSr_zlQqve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7PrQUE1FdT_BMY6npw6IieohKKDvisFZVGoSympB988F5YX9tEzA5-_8QhkCWqicCCqZYwk93Zdu1_GUgX3zj8naZaQIaPEd9FS3DG8ERe9HPCFwpdeNR-pqVgu2kV424%3D)) to help back up my conclusions—in addition to Fryer’s.

I also pointed out that there had been zero properly designed studies refuting Fryer’s findings. And I noted that a growing number of criminologists—like Paul Cassell, at the University of Utah; Lawrence Rosenthal, at Chapman University; and Richard Rosenfeld, at the University of Missouri-St. Louis—now believed that the false rhetoric around police bias had played a key role in the recent spike in violent crime. This suggested that the BLM lie had led to the murder of thousands of black people.

To drive home my point, I included this striking statistic: On an average year, 18 unarmed black people and 26 unarmed white people are shot by police. By contrast, roughly 10,000 black people are murdered annually by criminals in their own neighborhoods.

When I returned from my leave of absence, I was ready to post my summary to the Hub, where my colleagues regularly posted things about any number of hot-button issues. Cynthia wasn’t sure. She wasn’t just worried about my job, but also about her job, and she was worried that word would get out to the rest of our community. BLM lawn signs lined our street. Our friends sympathized with the cause. We wondered whether we’d be ostracized. We spent many hours over many weeks talking it through. I had come close to posting and then pulled back, and then again, and again. We were talking about it in couples therapy. Finally, I got the okay from Cynthia to publish. She understood that this was about me speaking freely and honestly about something I knew about, cared about and felt I had the responsibility to do something about. I took a deep breath and shared my post on the Hub. It was early May 2021.

Within an hour or two, the moderators had taken down my post.

I messaged my Human Resources contact to inquire why my post had been removed. She told me anyone could flag a post for review, at which point it would be immediately taken down. She didn’t say anything else. I had no idea who had objected or what the grounds for the objection were, or when, if ever, my post would be reinstated. 

Over the next two weeks, I kept checking back with her to see when they would reinstate it. After a good bit of waiting and wondering, she told me that “a team of human resources and communications professionals” was reviewing it. I asked if I’d be allowed to discuss the moderators’ concerns with them. She said no. Finally, she told me my post would not be reinstated because it had been deemed “antagonistic” and “provocative.”

When I asked what, exactly, was antagonistic or provocative, she suggested I speak with the Head of Diversity and Inclusion. So, I scheduled a meeting.

I should mention that, while this was going on with H.R., I met with my manager, who expressed surprise and concern that I had written and then shared my post. It could hurt me at the company, she said. It could put the kibosh on any future promotions.

The next week, I met with the Head of Diversity and Inclusion. I asked what was wrong with my post. She said she couldn’t tell me, because she hadn’t been involved in the decision to remove it. (I was unclear whether she’d actually read it.) 

The next week, there was another meeting—this time with H.R. and Diversity and Inclusion. I wanted to know what I had to change in my post to make it acceptable. They suggested scrubbing all instances of the term “systemic racism,” to start. 

So I did that, and the piece was reinstated. I was relieved. Such discussion about facts and statistics *had* to be permitted. It was impossible to report the news accurately if employees were not allowed to have internal, sometimes heated discussions about pretty much anything.

Then the comments started rolling in. A handful of BLM supporters, all of them white, said that, as a white person, I had no place criticizing BLM. They called my review of the academic literature “whitesplaining” (failing to note that many of the academics I cited were black). I was publicly derided as a “troll,” “confused,” “laughable,” and “not worth engaging with or even attempting to have an intelligent conversation” with. One colleague said: “I do not believe that there is any point in trying to engage in a blow-by-blow refutation of your argument, and I will not do so. My unwillingness to do so doesn't signal the strength of your argument. If someone says, ‘The KKK did lots of good things for the community—prove me wrong,’ I'm not obligated to do so.”

Notably absent from the attacks directed at me was even a single substantive challenge to the facts I was citing.

It was insulting and painful. Not a single executive, no one in H.R., no one in Diversity and Inclusion, condemned any of the public attacks on me. They were silent. I’m not surprised no one came to my defense. Who would take that kind of a risk? It became very clear very fast that my public takedown was intended to ensure that there would be no discussion around BLM or the question of police brutality and race.

After enduring waves of abuse, I emailed H.R. to express my concern about these attacks on me and their chilling effect. They responded by removing my post—and shutting down the conversation. I was told that, if I discussed my experience on any internal company communications channel, I would be fired.

I was distraught.  Here I was trying to bring the company's attention to how we were spreading lies that were contributing to the murders of thousands of black people, and I was compared to a Klansman sympathizer, and forbidden by the company to discuss any of it.

I had little doubt about the sincerity of H.R.’s threat to fire me.  But I still had a faint hope that the company’s senior leadership would right the ship if I could only make them aware of the matter.  Regardless, given the way the internal conversation had ended, I didn’t see a tenable way to continue working at the company without some sort of resolution. 

So, I sent [an email to colleagues and company leadership](https://kriegman.substack.com/p/email-for-which-i-was-fired), again expressing concern about how the attacks against me had successfully shut down any productive conversation and left my reputation in tatters. The next day, H.R. called me to say that my access to all company computer and communications systems had been revoked.

Three days later, on June 8, 2021, I was fired.

“As we discussed on Friday,” H.R. said in their parting email, “you’ve violated our expressed direction and have repeatedly refused to follow the counsel offered.” The email went on:“The manner in which you’ve conducted yourself in recent weeks does not align with our expectations for you as a leader within Thomson Reuters.”

A decade ago, my experience at Thomson Reuters would have been unthinkable. Most Americans probably think it’s still unthinkable. That’s what makes it so dangerous. Most of us don’t understand how deeply compromised our news sources have become. Most of us have no idea that we are suffused with fictions and half-truths that sound sort of believable and are shielded from scrutiny by people whose job is to challenge them. This is true, above all, of my fellow liberals, who assume that only Republicans complain about the mainstream media. But this is not a partisan issue. This is a We The People issue.

In January, I filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination stating that I was fired in retaliation for complaining about a racially hostile work environment. (The MCAD works in conjunction with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.) We’ll see whether the state finds that there are grounds for a lawsuit.

However that shakes out will not change the fact that thousands of black Americans are dead, in part because too many people are still unaware of basic facts about policing since their trusted news sources meticulously obscure the truth. The job of journalists is to report the stories that don’t comport with the prevailing or popular narrative. We desperately need them to do that again.

And then, on the other end, we get brigades from Donald supporters. It's strange that /r/conspiracy has become the battleground for the political ideas on Reddit since /r/politics has become a place where you just get the DNC establishment narrative and has been abandoned by people who want to find the truth.

But let me try to explain the slight support of Trump that comes naturally here compared to the disdain toward Hillary. Hillary is a proven swamp monster. She is proven to be above the law. With Trump, there was a slight hope that the swamp would be drained. He ran on that, although he may have just been lying. We'll see, but he wasn't a proven swamp monster. He may be one. If so, he is just more of the same to us conspiracy minded people. Nothing different. Nothing to be more outraged about than we were before. But he may not be a swamp monster. With Hillary, we have a proven swamp monster of the greatest sort running free from any justice. 

As if anyone can speak for the conspiracy community as a whole, but we are generally a group for justice. And we wouldn't be upset if Trump would be prosecuted for wrongs that he does. But we would really like to see the swamp monsters prosecuted and not just use the justice system used by the powerful to go after their political opponents while they get off for equal or worse crimes. 

So if Trump is prosecuted for Russian interactions, then Hillary should be too. And whoever else was involved in the bribes for uranium through the Clinton Foundation. We don't want to see justice unfairly given toward one side or the other. 

So the post trying to connect Trump more to Epstein than Bill Clinton who was actually a frequent flyer comes across as very disingenuous. Although, it has received a lot of traction here for some reason. But it's hypocritical to be outraged at Trump's connections to him and not totally outraged at the Clintons, who are, unfortunately, still relevant to our political environment.

But the mainstream media only pushes for justice to be given to Trump, and that keeps our conspiracy antennas on high alert. If they were also going after crimes committed during the Obama administration the same way, you wouldn't feel that we were taking a side. We just want equal justice. We desire a society free or corruption. At the core, I think that is what most of us conspiracy people are about.

I can go into how we were happily living under a secular democratic system for a short period of time after centuries of having a Kingdom and a dictator to rule us. I always wonder what could we achieve if we didn’t have oil, or if Musaddegh wasn’t as honorable as he was and would have become a friend to the west, negotiating on a deal that would have worked for both sides, even more for the US. I have pride but I would have wanted a good relation with the west even if that meant selling out our assets/resources to a foreign country for cheaper because the alternative has been misery for the majority of Iranians, especially in the last 15 years.

What I know is that we had a secular system, with laws based on humanity and ethics not some guy's book from 1400 years ago who wasn’t even a Persian. Musaddegh didn’t sell out, he was toppled and Shah was installed. Shah did great things economically which in itself is a whole story but there were still many people living in poverty who didn’t like Shah living lavishly like a KING when they could barely afford a roof over their head.

He also oppressed religious minorities to some extent, banned headscarf and persecuted activists. Anyhow he fucked up and people believed and fell for right wing promise of a religious (and secular at the same time!) Mulla revolution that will bring oil money to everyone’s table, people, not only the ones in charge!

People believed in him, Khomeini, and it turned out his promise was a lie. The opposite happened. No one except the people in charge has seen any of that oil money in the past 4 decades

I come from a small town where all schools, hospital, roads, pipeline, and basically every bit of infrastructure are built by donations from a few wealthy and generous people we have.

Some facts that are barely discussed in English speaking forums. Like how 80-90% of people working for the regime and more important politicians have dual nationalities along with their spouses and kids. MANY from the US and Europe.

Ali Larijani who is the speaker of the Parliment, very anti American(politics)and also happens to  be the Leader Khamenei’s son in Law, has a daughter who lives in Ohio and has finished her medical school there. So you see in the case of a war, almost none of them are gonna get hurt. Their families will be out of Iran in matter of days.

I have not seen many people in the west describing the situation in Iran correctly. Why? Well one because they are right to not believe the MSM and government’s narrative but none are talking to actual Iranians directly, neither pro Trump nor anti war people in the west.

Don't take me and my stats for my word. What I have said or am saying could be asked from any Iranian. You can find hundreds of us on social media and more than a few know how to communicate basic messages in English. Just talk to them. I would suggest visiting our country to get the truth but at this time I don’t recommend it at all. Unless you are an activist. But it is still risky because you can’t really report the whole truth from there. The government would only allow half of it ( the part people being angry at the west, not the entire reality and the majority being angry at the government)

Pro government people are mourning his death and anti government people (the majority) are not. I can't say what percentages of Iranians are unhappy with the government but I know for a fact that we are in the majority, well over 70% if you ask me. Among the younger generation, which are the majority of Iranians that number is well above 90%.

If these numbers seem irrational and unrealistic, look up and read the US's congress and Senate's approval rating. It isn't any better.

The anti government portion is more worry of the possibility of a war because they don't wanna die for a system they despise while pro government people are expecting demand a retaliation.

98% of people in the west are looking at this as it is a black or white situation while this couldn't be any grayer.

Soleimani was fighting isis in Iraq (in itself a good thing ) in a war that again, the majority of Iranians don't support. Iran’s alliance in Syria is of a diplomatic nature not based on humanity or saving people from isis or whatever.

Soleimani was also the guy in charge of repressing anti government protest in Iran for decades, including 2008 uprising over a rigged election ( it was actually funny how rigged it was but they still got away with it). Thousands of protesters were gunned down under his command. The protests about three months ago over gas prices hiking up also resulted in over 500 deaths. The sad part is both the left, right nor independent channels I watch and follow really reported on this topic.

If a war breaks out, the true victims of this situation are without a doubt the majority of Iranians, getting screwed by both the Iranian regime and US government, just as we are now.

The sanctions don’t hurt the rich or the government. It hurts the middle class and poor which consist the majority of Iranians.

Living expense has increased 3, 4 folds, while wages have doubled at max. Property value/rent has risen almost anywhere from 5-10 times, in response to our currency tanking over sanctions. The poor has become extremely poor and the middle class has become poor while the wealthy which owns property and materials like cars have become millionaires and the multi millionaires even wealthier!

The cheapest (one of the shittiest available) car made in Iran, Kia Pride, (a newer version an old Kia Pride model) goes for 70 M toman brand new. The same car was 6 million a decade ago. I remember it being 6 million since I was a kid and …. That’s where we are after 10 years of sanctions.

Ok I will end this rant now

Neither pro war nor anti war people in the US are right on their report of the situation.

pro war people:

Soleimani is bad (true but not for the reason they say. Edit: This is what I mean. I don't believe he was going to harm Any American or as they say was involved in ""an imminent threat."" I think Neocons wanted a provocation with Iran for a long time and ... .

 I've read the majority of American death attributed to him are from Iraq war time, 10 years ago. I believe he was capable of doing a lot of bad shit, or has done in the past and wish him and all criminals like him could face a judge and jury!  I just don't buy into what Pompeo and Trump say like I never liked Obama and Biden/Hillary.

This video is also very telling.

 I remember watching this live like it was yesterday.

""I don't like Assad at all but Assad is killing isis. Russia is killing isis and Iran is killing isis!"" Trump 2016""

[https://youtu.be/Hb4HBxmf29w?t=85](https://youtu.be/Hb4HBxmf29w?t=85)

&#x200B;

@ 1:25

And now suddenly Pompeo and Trump say he was the baddest guy in the world? Why didn't they go after him in 2009,10... Every crime he is accused of comitting, Killing protesters in Iran and Americans in Iraq dates back to 2000s. 

&#x200B;

Iran government bad (true, but is US government doing anyone any good?)

95% want government gone: not really that high. Unfortunately US's response and actions has given government more support no matter how much they suck. Trump killing Soleimani this way pushes people who are in the middle to the government’s side. So will a war. Saddam’s invasion with West’s “go ahead and blessing” only made the recently won revolution more popular, so will a war waged against a despised regime and forcing people to fight for a system that has oppressed them all their life, taking away the basic freedom and choices a human deserves.

I’d like to believe the regime doesn’t have more than 20% supports but I don’t have a number on that. It is hard to conduct independent surveys with the limited freedoms of speech and press we have. if you live among Iranians, it won’t take you more than a week to realize the majority want a total reform.

\-90% would love us to bomb them!(false). Like I said, the Iranian civilians will pay the highest cost for that war. Looking at our neighbors, they don’t seem to be better off than they were before US’s invasion.

Anti war people:

\-Soleimani was good (false. Fighting isis doesn't make him a good guy! He wasn't fighting them to defend his people, for a good cause even though he believed that. Iran’s fight against ISIS has nothing to do with what the majority of Iranians wanted).

\-Iran government good: (false) Not all of them are pushing this narrative. Secular talk and Kim Iverson on youtube have both correctly reported that Iranians are very unhappy with their government. Yet 95% of the left, anti war voices on the right and independents who are calling out Trump on this ignore this part. I know why they are doing it though. One you agree with the CIA’s talking point that X is a bad guy, then they say “well we have to do something about it don’t we?” and many people with good intentions would think that’s the right thing to do! Manufacturing consent I suppose it is called. Or maybe I’m wrong. But in this case, the bad guy is really bad! I’m upset they don’t say it but what I care more is me, my relatives and my compatriots not getting bombed. So I’m thankful to every anti war voice on the left, right and independent, even if they are reporting what goes on inside Iran not accurately.

\-The majority don't want a war (true!) I don’t think this needs an explanation.

I'm personally not saddened even for a bit over Soleimani’s death news, but the possibility of a war has made me quit worry. I’ve always been afraid of war. Not dying in it but surviving it while many of the people I know and care for don't.

My numbers are my opinions and what I perceive. I encourage everyone to their own research on the things they can find online and talk to Iranians, the one who live in Iran, if you want to know how they feel about this situation! You will find many people angry at the government who would love anything, including a war, as oppose to the current situation but the majority don't want a war.

I’d like to leave it with a positive note which is a fact. Americans are probably the most liked  nationality for Iranians. Again I encourage all you to watch Peter’s video on Iran. Take his word for it not mine

For me personally, the most welcoming and warm people I have met in my life have been Americans and I have lived a few countries.

This war isn’t between us, the people, but sadly it is us who have to fight the wars.

Forgive my grammar, spelling and poor writing skills.

If you really  did read all of it, you really do give a shit. Thanks!

In a newly published interview on Popula by journalist Maria Bustillos (via Deadline), Bourdain envisioned Weinstein naked in his bathroom having a stroke. The late chef and television host told Bustillos he’d prefer to see Weinstein “beaten to death in his cell.”  “My theory of how he goes is uh, he’s brushing his teeth in a bathroom, he’s naked in his famous bathrobe, which is flapping open, he’s holding his cell phone in one hand because you never know who on the Weinstein board has betrayed him recently, and he’s brushing his teeth,” Bourdain said. “He suddenly gets a massive fucking stroke.”  “He stumbles backwards into the bathtub,” Bourdain continued, “where he finds himself um, with his robe open feet sticking out of the tub, and in his last moments of consciousness as he scrolls through his contacts list trying to figure out who he can call, who will actually answer the phone.”  Bourdain said he imagined Weinstein dying “knowing that no one will help him and that he is not looking his finest at time of death.” The interview between Bourdain and Bustillos was conducted in February in New York City but wasn’t published until Sunday, July 15, just over a month after Bourdain died. The lengthy discussion also finds Bourdain criticizing Bill Clinton as a “piece of shit” and praising Barack Obama as “the most gracious.”  “Bill Clinton, look, the bimbo eruptions—it was fucking monstrous,” Bourdain said. “That would not have flown today. A piece of shit. Entitled, rapey, gropey, grabby, disgusting, and the way that he—and she—destroyed these women and the way that everyone went along, and, and are blind to this! Screamingly apparent hypocrisy and venality.”  Bourdain pointed out how “unforgivable” it is that Bill and Hillary Clinton buried women like Monica Lewinsky after they came forward about Bill’s indiscretions. “When you’re in the room, you think wow, she’s really warm and nice and funny,” Bourdain said about Hillary. “But the way they efficiently dismantled, destroyed, and shamelessly discredited these women for speaking their truth is unforgivable.”](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/anthony-bourdain-harvey-weinstein-death-bill-clinton-interview-1201984322/#!)

TPTB/MSM have a significant portion of the population drowning in cognitive dissonance, conditioned to support the genocidal ambitions of the military industrial complex.",1461.0,a8azj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/a8azj4/the_reaction_to_the_news_that_us_troops_are/,353.0,1545405818.0,"I've never seen anything like this.

Just like how TPTB blinded people with ""hope"" during the Obama administration, they are similarly blinding folks with ""hate"" over Trump, which almost completely prevents a rational dialogue about these issues from taking place.

The Mockingbird MSM has unabashedly fallen victim to these morbid obsessions, as their hatred for Trump and their obsession with Russia is causing them to lose all credibility on the world stage.

For example, when discussing the news about troop withdrawal from Syria, NPR was aggressively spinning this story as ""making Putin very happy"" and ""being fantastic for Putin.""

When someone (a caller or guest) expressed doubt about this, the host, exasperated, said something like ""but, but...someone heard Putin say he was happy!""

NPR should be ashamed of themselves for perpetrating these Mockingbird Media narratives. Here's Putin's *actual* response:

[Putin says ""I do generally agree with the President of the United States.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA10hspHG-w)

According to the NPR ""news"" story, I was expected Putin to be cackling with glee. He's not.

Here's the crazy thing: If Putin *really* is trying to cause destabilization in the US, he's doing a piss poor job compared to the Mockingbird MSM.

To NPR and these other ""news"" outlets: STOP TALKING ABOUT PUTIN. YOU ARE GIVING HIM THE PLATFORM THAT HE WANTS.

Who *cares* what Putin thinks?? Stop inserting him into *every* story. You are fostering and perpetuating bona fide xenophobia and should be ashamed of yourselves.

I would imagine that it strokes his ego on a *daily* basis to see such hysterics from the Western media apparatus (same with Trump!). 

Ending these interminable operations of the military industrial complex's war machine may be one of the most significant events of our time (*if* Trump stays true and is successful in this endeavor, and that's a big *if*). The fact that this was *immediately* twisted to evoke the ""big baddy"" Putin is so obviously propaganda from the military industrial complex that it's stunning.

In addition, so many otherwise rational folks are in unison with these TPTB-mandated talking points that I'm starting to wonder just how deeply these individuals have been conditioned by the war machine and the MSM...and if they can ever get out.

One of these talking points is that ""I support withdrawing troops, but not without a plan first!""

Fuck that. That's the military industrial complex's wet dream: more artificial timelines and ""plans"" that can be milked for eternity, especially once a new president is picked that will ""play ball.""

Another pernicious way the population has been conditioned is to resist or be suspicious of *every* decision Trump makes, even if it's a good one.

I see *so* many folks uttering the disclaimer ""I hate Trump, but...""

*This* is the perfect example of just how bad this propaganda has become when we can't even talk about shit we need to accomplish without first distancing ourselves from Trump.

For example, it's *unconscionable* that hemp was still *illegal* to grow in the US in 2018.

If Obama had *very simply* signed an executive order to reverse such a moronic and antiquated policy, he would have been lauded as a hero.

Instead, there are currently *zero* stories about hemp legalization on /r/news and *one* on /r/politics, and the response has been so muted that it's practically deafening.

Granted, the neocons in the Trump administration are certainly still cause for concern, but until Trump tries to start a war with Iran or someone else, their presence doesn't seem to be cause for immediate alarm (again, time will tell on this point and others).

Perhaps even more astonishing, I see throngs of folks lamenting the resigning of ""Mad Dog Mattis"" because...he disagrees with Trump?

Mattis is a career war hawk and represents everything that's wrong with the rampant and insane military industrial complex. His departure should be greeted with resounding cheers and celebration from everyone who loves peace and abhors genocide.

Instead, the once burgeoning antiwar movement that arose during the 2000's has been entirely turned on its face, as so many people have been brainwashed to believe the claims of the career politicians and the military fat cats.

While Obama was the perfect catalyst to extinguish the antiwar movement, Trump seems to be playing a new role of causing cognitive dissonance, but on the opposite end of the spectrum of Obama. Whether Trump is a useful idiot or a bad actor in this regard remains to be seen, but this issue is largely irrelevant with respect to the damage being done.

This hatred for Trump is becoming so emotionally visceral that it's practically impossible to have rational and constructive conversations about these issues.

I can only assume that these disturbing trends are going to get worse before they get better, though that does seem hard to imagine!

Bring the US troops home now, end the military industrial complex's endless war machine, and end the Drug War!

I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.


[Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?](https://spectator.org/the-invisible-awan-brothers-scandal/)

I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. 

Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm). Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511) and knew [Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch) and through [three degrees of separation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/) used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/). If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.






• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?

• The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. 

• The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. 





### The Media
Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.

>With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ) you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath.

Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569).

>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.

This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/transformers/).

This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes...

 The media is [90% Democrat](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/) and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists?





 










>One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder — why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all?

>Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they can’t sell papers with such a story to tell?














###The Smoking Gun

[EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/exclusive-house-intelligence-it-staffers-fired-in-computer-security-probe/)

>[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html) is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.

>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.

>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.

>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.

Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/). Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers.

>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.


After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers.

>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.



The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/). House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. 

This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. 

Let's state that again...

###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data.

No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.""





###The Bad Guy


###Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach


The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data.

[House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586)

>Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge.

>More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.


>The former staffer said “Jamal was always there,” but Imran would only work “odd hours.”

And who is investigating this fiasco?

>Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? 


D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the [Congressional members](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586) involved with the Awan Brothers. 

>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.

>""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.

Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. 

The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/) to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. 



>    Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.

>Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/).

Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.

>Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their [TOP SECRET CLEARANCE](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf).

[Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1)
>[frontpagemag](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield) |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.

>The [signatories to the letter](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf) were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.


Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418) and [Huma Abedin](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556) are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?

[http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/)
>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.

>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.




with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. 





















What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. 

While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. 

I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2 will help you clarify who is who.)


King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  


Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away.


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

Esteban says CIA controlled his mind and implanted voices in his head telling him to kill. MSM says by Esteban surrendering to the police after the shooting proves he knew what he did was wrong. 

Today's technology with super computers and artificial intelligence software has revolutionized the development. Most technology is classified and only a few patents registered. The latest was in 2002 when voice to Skull was patented. Today's technology enables a 2 way communication with the brain with voices and images (holograms). Pentagon says the brain is like a huge computer without a firewall. It's all about the electric signals going to and from the brain. This technology is according to the experts the most important invention since the nuclear bomb

It's no secret the government uses MK Ultra in Hollywood. Did the CIA use Hollywood celebs for their first group of guinea pigs before they started producing assassins to pull off mass shootings for their special ""gun control"" agenda? 

Steven Seagal knows the dark secrets of hollywood and he stands behind the Second amendment and Constitution. He believes the CIA is engineering mass shootings with MKultra to push harsher gun laws and eventually will take our guns away.

A Famous saying is HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF... 

In 1933, the ultimate extremist group, led by Adolf Hitler, seized power and used the records to identify, disarm, and attack political opponents and Jews. Constitutional rights were suspended, and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued. Police revoked gun licenses of Social Democrats and others who were not “politically reliable.”

During the five years of repression that followed, society was “cleansed” by the National Socialist regime. Undesirables were placed in camps where labor made them “free,” and normal rights of citizenship were taken from Jews. The Gestapo banned independent gun clubs and arrested their leaders. Gestapo counsel Werner Best issued a directive to the police forbidding issuance of firearm permits to Jews.

I live in Texas and we love our guns! Last year there were a lot of military exercises in towns with tanks, and talks about FEMA camps etc  We feared obama was going to declare martial law before leaving office so everyone I know bought more guns and ammo and was literally ready to put up a fight. 

[Obama shows his anger towards Texans and their guns] (https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=2G1W8rbxOSU)

Let me ask you this... how did the government get the mass population to agree with invading Afghan and Iraq? 
Organizing the biggest false flag of them all... 9/11.

Just go to twitter and search hashtag [#FortLauderdale ](https://sli.mg/IGt3yn) and you will see all the sheeple screaming for GUN CONTROL! Gtfo sheep

If you think The elites are gonna surrender and drop their NWO agenda bc Trump won... you're crazy. Trump has the right words but so did JFK and you see what they did with him.

For whatever reason, Reddit is super pro-vaccine mandate. (Never mind being pro-vaccine, that's totally understandable.) But the types of posts that get upvoted... always support the notion of stripping away people's freedoms, without any due process, simply over the vaccine. Do vaccinated people *really* hate the unvaccinated this much?  This really feels like *manufactured* hate towards a group of people over a what's supposed to be a personal choice.

On r/politics this week, any news story about Joe Biden and his vaccine mandate- upvoted! Any news story about the court's injunction against it- downvoted! Seriously, progressives that never even voted for him during the primaries are now okay with him acting like a king?

There's even an increasingly aggressive push to vaccinate children, even though we all knew very early on that children have near-zero risk. Suddenly, all the ""Science"" we learned in 2020 goes out the window because of the vaccine.  Today, you can't even ask a question like *""why don't the fully vaccinated get tested every week too, if they can also get Covid?""* without getting banned.

Hello! Some countries are starting to add Boosters to their vaccine mandates- your vaccination status *IS NOT PERMANENT*! CDC is already recommending boosters, Pfizer (who suddenly became Reddit's angel overnight) is trying to get another Emergency Authorization for its own Booster. If you got the one-shot J&J, you're basically already considered unvaccinated.

Seriously, even liberals and progressives- are you really okay with this? A ""freedom pass"" expires every 6-8 months- every single mainstream news article that talks about ""waning immunity"" always, always, always concludes with ""get a booster ASAP"". 

Anyways, TL;DR -- the whole narrative regarding vaccines really supports the ""Dead-Internet Theory"". I reaaally doubt there is this much widespread support for forfeiting our freedoms over a vaccine passport, even among the fully vaccinated.",conspiracy,Obama

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

While Sanders is still out there fighting for a living wage, medicare for all, and tuition free college, you only pop into the media when you feel like blaming someone for your loss, in support of Trump ordering missile strikes, or when you have something to sell.  Don't allow Clinton and establishment Democrats to revise history, we have records of what really happened.

161,"[OC] A reminder that the US Shadow Government legalized itself on 9/11 via ""Continuity of Government"".",925.0,aj2how,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aj2how/oc_a_reminder_that_the_us_shadow_government/,185.0,1548266664.0," The definition of 'Continuity of Government' is a set of contingency plans to ensure that essential government functions remain in place after a disaster such as nuclear war. In the United States, Continuity of Government plans have been on the books since at least the Eisenhower administration. The plans involved building intricate hidden command centers such as the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center built in 1959, nestled away in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

While the Government officially classifies Mt. Weather as a 'bunker', many sources claim that it is essentially a full blown city. According to GlobalSecurity.org, a respected institution in the intelligence community, Mount Weather contains a hospital, sewer treatment system, reservoirs, a power plant, an emergency television studio, and a thorough system of dormitories and office buildings.^1

None of this is out of the ordinary, so to speak. It is reasonable for the government to have such plans in place. However, **on September 11, 2001, the Continuity of Operations plan was officially activated and has been live ever since, meaning that Mt. Weather and similar installations are likely in operation today.**

> ,“A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States,” President George W. Bush proclaimed on September 14, 2001.

Dick Cheney officially enacted the “Continuation of Government” plans shortly after the World Trade Center attacks, although the Bush Administration would not confirm that this took place until March, 2002.^2 **A simultaneous 'State of Emergency' was declared and is also in effect today, extended each year by George Bush, Barack Obama, and then** [**Donald Trump**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/14/permanent-emergency-trump-becomes-third-president-renew-extraordinary-post-9-11-powers/661966001/)**.^3**

CBS reported:

> “A 'shadow government' consisting of 75 or more senior officials has been living and working secretly outside Washington since Sept. 11 in case the nation's capital is crippled by terrorist attack. ""This is serious business,"" President Bush said of plans to ensure the continuity of government.  

> Such an operation was conceived as a Cold War precaution against nuclear attack during the Eisenhower administration but never used until now. It went into effect in the first hours after the terror attacks and has evolved over time, said senior government officials who provided details of the plan.  

> Under the classified ""Continuity of Operations Plan,"" which was first reported by *The Washington Post* in its Friday editions, high-ranking officials representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the assignment at one of two fortified locations along the East Coast.  

> The Post said the first rotations were made in late October or early November, a fact confirmed by a senior government official late Thursday.  

> Officials who are activated for the duty live and work underground 24 hours a day, away from their families, according to the Post. The shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals.  

> The government-in-waiting is an extension of a policy that has kept Vice President Dick Cheney in secure, undisclosed locations away from Washington. Cheney has moved in and out of public view as threat levels have fluctuated.”^4

**Serious business indeed. There have been instances where Congressmen have been stonewalled when trying to learn more about the secret operations. One example is Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, pushed to review the classified portion of the Continuity plan in a secure setting in 2007 but his access was denied.^5**

What can we know about the Continuity of Operations plan currently in effect? Patrick Thronson, editor-in-chief of the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, has put together the most comprehensive publicly available paper detailing the states of emergencies and powers granted to the executive branch.^6 Available knowledge is naturally incomplete because many powers and documents are still classified. Some highlights include:

**•** **Congress is required by statue to vote on the continuation of a state of National Emergency every six months. Since September 11th, 2001, it has only happened once.**  

**•** **There are currently thirty simultaneous declared states of emergency.**  

• The Executive Branch can freeze the assets and prevent financial transactions of individuals. This extends to even basic life necessities. They can go as far as to prohibit donations of food to said person. 
 
• The president can unilaterally order the inspection and seizure of commercial vessels.  

• The president is authorized to suspend or alter rules for broadcast stations, or authorize control of said station.  

• Provisions to suspend or control internet traffic.  

**""Thus, the only apparent legal obstacle standing between present conditions and this degree of government control over mass media and telecommunications is a presidential order. "" – Thronson**  

• The ability to seize property  

• The delegation of 'maintaining law and order' to the department of defense.  

• Extend military tours of duty beyond contractually agreed termination dates.  

""A nation under thirty states of national emergency can hardly claim that emergency laws are the exception to—rather than the rule of—normal governance. "" – Thronson


Pretty fucking shocking, right? A legitimate shadow government revealed itself for a moment, and wields extreme powers secretly, and no one is talking about it.

This is such an important part of the puzzle. Everything is staged because this secret group of psychopaths is pulling the strings. This is the group that is truly controlling the actions of the NSA, DARPA, Military etc.

The implications are that the workings of Congress, the Justice Department, the Presidency and other institutions have become merely a show to distract from the reality that a secret government which does not respond to civilian rule and has granted itself sweeping, unchecked powers and is certainly directly operating in the realm of foreign policy, covert activities and likely domestic espionage, among other potential activities.

Think about how controlled the media has to be for no one to be talking about it. And how ridiculous the overton window of debate seems when you realize it is completely removed from reality.

We are all yelling at each other hating each other right now and it's this way by design, so we fight ourselves instead of the people truly controlling us.

Thanks for reading 

Love vibes, 
Timothy.

Yes, the timing is obviously politically motivated, yet that doesnt make the contents any less significant or any less damning to me.
The narrative that I was lead to believe was incredibly far from the whole truth.. Only sharing for anyone else like me who was believing a wildly inaccurate narrative.. Some of this was just for context, but a lot of it are things I've only recently learned.

Sorry if its a bit scattered, there was a lot of things I didn't know. Maybe everyone else already knows all the details, if so, I apologize for wasting your time.

It turns out, they're all crooks.

Burisma is a Ukrainian natural gas company that was founded and ran by a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, who was basically the poster-child for corruption.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky

The SFO investigator Richard Gould claimed in the April 2014 court hearing that Zlochevsky’s dual position in Ukraine as both a politician and a businessman gave “rise to a clear - wilful and dishonest exploitation of a direct conflict of interest by a man holding an important public office - to an abuse of the public’s trust in him”.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/the-money-machine-how-a-high-profile-corruption-investigation-fell-apart

“May 13, 2014: Burisma Group announced that Hunter Biden [and Devon Archer] would be joining its board. Around that time, Burisma’s founder, a former government official named Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for alleged money laundering by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-timeline-idUSKBN1W82HK

Zlochevsky is still suspected of bribery and other crimes by several different countries. (His whereabouts are currently unknown.)

https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senate-probe-finds-john-kerry-falsely-claimed-he-had-no-knowledge-of-hunter-bidens-role-in-burisma/


Viktor Shokin was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in 2015-2016. He was leading an investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shokin

According to him, ""On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of [Burisma], but I refused to close this investigation.”

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/documents-heighten-scrutiny-on-biden-ukraine-dealings-indicate-hunter-may-have-made-millions


So Burisma.. The same company that sent Hunter Biden $83k every month to do nothing?

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf

“Hunter Biden sat on the Burisma board from April 2014 (while the company was already under investigation) until April 2019.”

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/13/20912336/hunter-biden-resigns-chinese-firm-impeachment-inquiry-joe-trump


So we know Hunter Biden was on the Board of Directors at Burisma while they were being investigated by Viktor Shokin.. Well here’s where it got interesting to me..

Testimony from sworn affidavit of former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin:

“6. ...[President] Poroshenko asked me to resign due to pressure from the US Presidential administration, in particular from Joe Biden, who was the US Vice-President. Biden was threatening to withhold USD$ 1 billion in subsidies to Ukraine until I was removed from office…""

“7. The official reason put forward for my dismissal was that I had allegedly failed to secure the public's trust. Poroshenko and other state officials, including representatives of the US presidential administration, had never previously had any complaints about my work, however. There were no grievances against me or any allegations that had I committed any corruption-related (or, indeed any other) criminal offenses. Biden never stated anything of the kind either…”

“8. The Truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings (""Burisma""), a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors. I assume Burisma...had the support of the US Vice-President Joe Biden because his son was on the Board of Directors.”

“9. On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company, but I refused to close this investigation. Therefore, I was forced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration. In my conversations with Poroshenko at the time, he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma. When I did not, he said that the US (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice, therefore, but to ask me to resign.”

- December 8, 2019, former Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by a reporter whether he knew of Hunter Biden’s activities during his tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry told the reporter regarding Biden’s position on the Burisma board. “What would I know about any—no. Why would I know about any company or any individual? No.”

However, Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee that he informed Kerry personally of Biden’s role at Burisma. Wade received an email on May 13, 2014, from Kerry’s stepson, Chris Heinz, telling him that Hunter Biden and associate Devon Archer had joined Burisma.

John Kerry and Devon Archer are the ones who made me realize this isn't just about Joe and Hunter Biden..

When I looked at John Kerry is when I started to get pissed.. This wasn't just your run of the mill ""pops looking out for his boy"" type of corruption.. This is definitely something bigger than just Hunter and his father..

Archer was definitely the redpill for me..

""BHR Partners...is a private investment fund founded in 2013 by Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co., Ltd., which is controlled by BANK OF CHINA LIMITED""

""BHR was founded in 2013, by two Chinese-registered asset managers, Bohai Industrial Investment Fund and Harvest Fund Management, and two U.S. organisations, Thornton Group LLC and Rosemont Seneca Partners.""

""According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Bohai is China's oldest private equity firm, having launched the country's first yuan-denominated fund in 2006....Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm founded by Michael Lin and James Bulger, son of former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger.[3] Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm, founded by Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Hunter Biden""

(This part seems unrelated, but they are odd coincidences.. Pelosi's companies have also had several questionable land deals and gov't contracts)
Coincidentally, like Hunter Biden, Paul Pelosi Jr also has a way of receiving overpaid positions that he is wildly underqualified for.. and also had a cushy position at companies working in Ukrainian energy..


“The firm InfoUSA, headed by major Clinton backer Vinod Gupta, has placed Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi Jr., on its payroll – even though he has no experience in the company's main business activities, NewsMax has learned.”

“Just four weeks after Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House this past January, Gupta and InfoUSA hired her son as a senior vice president. He told NewsMax InfoUsa pays him $180,000 a year.

Even though his job with InfoUSA is considered full-time, Paul Pelosi continues another full-time job, as a home loan officer at Countrywide Home Loans, part of Countrywide Financial, in San Mateo, a suburb of San Francisco.”

Correct me if I'm wrong but the way I've interpreted this story is that the FBI investigation started* in 2009 and ended in 2015. The investigation began prior to the uranium deal and it was kept from Congress and the public. So no, it didn't take this long for it to end... it just took this long to come out.

Also, I'm not denying that there wasn't some kind of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign but I find it highly unlikely that as a non-political actor, he would have been able to achieve anything close to this level of corruption. 

Edit: words

Edit 2: fixed the time frame. Investigation began in 2009 and ended in 2015. It began prior to the uranium deal and the FBI failed to inform congress of what had been uncovered when the deal went through in 2010. ",conspiracy,Obama

[why is Alex Gatekeeping for CNP?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYl9iZlArjM) 

Well maybe because a little bit of research into them will take you from Rothschilds all the way to Trump.


Well first we can start with you see Jerome Corsi (Washington correspondent Infowars) is a member of [CNP](http://wariscrime.com/new/how-the-big-brother-controls-alternative-media/) - council for national policy. 

[As is Bannon.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.rawstory.com/2016/08/trump-campaign-ceo-and-manager-part-of-secret-extremist-right-wing-group-splc/amp/) Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. Breitbart was [founded by the Mercer family.](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years).
***


The Mercer family [are an old Rothschild proxy, very old money.](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Rothschild's_Bank_-_The_Best_Club_In_London)  
 Its a rarely discussed but very relevant fact that [Mercer was decisive in securing key positions for his long time family advisers ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit) - Kellyane Conway & Robert Bannon . In addition to working as assets on Mercer family projects, [Mercer had Conway organise the spending for Cruz's failed campaign.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-08-17/trump-s-new-team-brings-deep-ties-to-major-donor) . After which they changed their support to Trump. [The Mercer Foundation also happens to be the #1 financier of CNP](https://littlesis.org/org/37180/Council_for_National_Policy). [You may have seen Rebekah Mercer](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/politics/articles/2016-11-11/rebekah-mercer-daughter-of-major-donor-named-to-trump-role) named as part of Trumps transition team.

***
150 CNP members recently signed a draft of an executive order, [to protect Religious Liberty](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.toddstarnes.com/column/conservatives-call-on-trump-to-protect-religious-liberty%3Fformat%3Damp) .

>>If signed it would create wholesale exemptions from a range of nondiscrimination laws and regulations “for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.” 

After 8, years of liberal policies from Obama, the introduction of such a bill is designed to cause extreme unrest and division. As is always the case- when we fight each other, we remain blissfully unaware of the hidden hands.

So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sadbuttrue)worlds most recognisable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities. [Alex has acknowledge his family worked in the CIA](http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Jones-CIA.htm).

***
None of this new however. If you've been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember [Wilbur Ross?](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story,amp.html). Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. 
At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he'd been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.

>>When asked why he'd made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving.
>>""“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.

The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer & Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have accquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House.

For their agenda to be successful, they HAVE to portray their puppets and frontmen as nice and likable people that we can relate to, in order to gain our trust. 

They like to present these people as ""Everymen"". In other words, they shape and craft a character for the person in the position of power to play that makes them appeal to us. We like honesty in people, eye contact. We respond well to people who are ""down to earth"" or ""real"". We like people with a sense of humor and modesty, and we also are **very** interested in the relationship this person has with their wife/husband, (First man or lady).

People loved the type of relationship Michelle and Barrack Obama had together, because the media portrayed them to be this classic loving couple, and Obama of course as the ultimate gentleman. 

The elite choose charismatic and charming  men and women to carry out positions of power, because they are more **effective** and **productive** and at producing results. This is because the people will trust a charming and charismatic person. 

However, I don't think people are aware of how just sophisticated the means are in which they do this. This is a very big part of the process. Social media is a very big way in which they reach us, the millennial 18-28 generation In particular. They obviously use Internet memes and social platforms to push a certain impression of their candidates. 

With Obama, I think they really tried to appeal to women in particular, by portraying him as a gentleman who has nothing but the upmost respect for his wife, Michelle. Several internet memes displayed and depicted them as a loving married couple. That kind of stuff resonates with people, it makes them feel good inside, that this person in charge of them is an upstanding gentleman, women in particular. Can you see how this positive portrayal of these people could be beneficial to the elite?

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/vjmKi

However, do you REALLY think these two are *actually* like this in real life? I mean, c'mon...And regardless, how does that add credibility to how good of a job he is doing as president? 

Does anybody remember the time Obama went on ""Between two Ferns"" for college humor? It was a hilarious comedy sketch with Obama as the guest on the show. That made him look funny and cool to anyone who watched it, and that he has a sense of humor. In this age of Internet comedy and viral videos, it's the perfect avenue that they can use, to reach the youth and drum up some trust for them. (Link below).

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UnW3xkHxIEQ

Do you see how they are able to get the people's trust and respect for their puppets? They know that the population is not very politically aware, and that they don't follow EVERY SINGLE ISSUE and they don't keep up with current events, so all they have to do is make this person appear to be trustworthy, and they will support them regardless. **This is the reality, most people are not politically informed on anything at all, they vote based on character alone**

Does anybody remember the Biden and Barrack memes? They depicted the Obama presidency as this, ""fun group of dudes who are just a bunch of rascals that like to have a good time and get into a bunch of wacky hijinks"".

You guys all know how memes can affect the way people think. They are trying to ""lighten up"" and ""soften"" Joe's Image. Are you aware that there is some pretty incriminating footage of this guy groping and touching young children on CSPAN?

This is a man who is wanted in several countries for war crimes. This guy had prior knowledge of 9/11. This is a full grown man who relishes in the evil things he has done, not some ""harmless goofy bimbo"" like they are trying to portray him. 

What I'm getting at is, do you see how much effort goes into shaping these peoples characters, and trying to make them palatable to the people? Social media, Facebook, Google, SNL, you name it. 

**The elite are creating a cult of personality with these presidents and politicians, so that even if you don't know what policies they implement, you don't care because they are so charming**.

We need to be aware of this. I just wanted to shine a line on exactly how idiotic people can still support blatant criminals because they think they are ""such nice people"" or ""so down to earth"".

Consider however that if you live overseas, it was already legal for them to use their propaganda abroad. 

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5?op=1&r=US&IR=T

Also consider that psychology and propaganda tactics are used by the pharmaceutical industrial complex. So what if they just… joined forces? 

Since 2012, the US state department and pentagon can bypass media outlets and “directly disseminate information” I’ll leave you to decide if their propaganda is just another layer of misinformation and cover up. 

I do know this, however. In 2014 my dad worked for a global military aircraft company so he was aware of a fair few more things than the average person. 
One day he came off a business call laughing and saying that “they are trying to start a race war” 

I didn’t quite know what he meant at the time, but surely enough from the period of 2014 up until the current day I noticed that there was a certain rhetoric being pushed on the internet. “White people bad” “cultural appropriation” “BLM” all these things. I legitimately believe these were meant to incite division between the people and were actually propaganda. I love and support people of different races, but I can understand that these particular movements were brought on by covert propaganda mainly online. 

The internet has become the new war ground. 

Now looking at today, again for a few years since 2017-18 thereabouts there was a big push for “anti vaxx” hate. Knowing that all this time, it’s legal for America to use propaganda on its own citizens and the world. Keep this in mind. 

And now we arrive at the present day. Do you see it yet? This was always the plan, the internet was the battleground and your mind was always the prize

Edit: I’m aware that propaganda has been used covertly for ages, but I just want to point out that the propaganda has been more direct and everywhere since 2012. 
There’s still a lot of sleepers even on this subreddit visiting, and it won’t hurt at all to start having that necessary conversation about propaganda and identifying when and where it is used.",conspiracy,Obama

It seems as if the trust for Trump spread once the ""alternative media""  started to endorse him. Alex jones, PJW, cernovich,ect. Couldn't these  guys be gatekeepers that ""flipped"" on us? Our culture is being sucked into the partisan vaccum.

Here are a few concerns I have..

* Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.

When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; **""the trump name is still very much a future asset for us""...**

How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?

Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.

* After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The  point is, he lied to you, turned around, and ""got the band back  together"" so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ?

[https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments](https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments)

* Why did trump meet in private, and visit the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can anybody explain this? Are you OK with this and why?

* Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the ""terrorism boogeyman""  in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, ""bomb the  shit out of them and take the oil"". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?

Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did  he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?

[https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8YouTube](https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8)

* Why Is trump saying that the CIA is ""great"" and  ""terrific""? Why did he say that he was behind them ""1000&#37;""?

[https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cMYouTube](https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cM)

* Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of  US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?

Also, after criticizing Obama's policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?

Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump's.

* Finally after criticizing  Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips,  is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000  dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies?

These questions should be very easy for Trump supporters to explain. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB?

205,There was a massive amount of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary. We've witnessed the coordinated installation of a nominee against the will of the people.,751.0,6f3t7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6f3t7n/there_was_a_massive_amount_of_election_fraud/,177.0,1496527455.0,"Whether you're a fan of Debbie Lusignan's commentary or not, she put together a very in-depth blog in real-time, state-by-state, chronicling massive amounts of election fraud. Everything's covered;

-Voter Roll Purging (State by state... see Brooklyn alone, where over 125,000 people were seemingly kicked off the rolls. This nationwide phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to potential Sanders voters.)

-Unsolicited Party Affiliation Switching (Lifelong Dems being switched to Lib, Repub, or Independent in closed primaries by the thousands. In one of the more eggregious primaries, AZ, their SOS even testified under oath that this had occured in unprecedented numbers. As above, this phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to Sanders voters.)

-Caucus Rigging (The shenanigans in Iowa and especially NV should have caused more outrage than they did.)

-Absentee Ballot Stuffing (See Wyoming and Montanta for extreme examples of this.)

-Unparalleled Precinct Slashing (This occurred in many states with once again AZ being a prime example. Polling locations were cut to record lows. Lines stretched into the thousands and wait times were documented to be upwards of 4-6 hours in certain counties.)

-Auditing Anomolies (See the results and testimony before the Election Board following the Chicago micro-audit.)

Historic Exit Poll Discrepancies (In 12 states, the discrepancies were well outside of the margin of error and in some cases in the double-digits. These discrepancies were almost entirely exclusive to the Sanders/Clinton race, with everything else matching up within the margin of error as expected. Look at the difference between the exit polls in the Republican Primary versus the Democratic... it's night and day. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that after the exit poll anamolies started to gain serious traction, they were eliminated in each state for the remainder of the primary. Independent exit polls were conducted in the states where official ones were cancelled and often showed massive discrepancies in regards to the official outcome... see CA.)

-Voter Database Breaches (This happened during a few key points pre-primary and during; the AZ breach being the most significant. Though unproven, many election integrity activists theorize that this is the means in which probable Sanders voters were unmasked and targeted for roll purges and affiliation switches.)

-Electronic Voting Machines (Ever since HBO's Hacking Democracy expose aired and bolstered recently by the work of Bev Harris at blackboxvoting dot org, the continued use of electronic voting machines, many of which have been banned in Europe at this point, is highly irresponsible. These machines have proven to be susceptible to remote hacking and provide no paper trail. In fact, there is proprietary software built into the machines themselves with the sole purpose of fractionally weighting the votes to meet a predetermined outcome. See Bev Harris' Fraction Magic mini-doc on youtube to see this exposed in real time. Whether or not this exploitiation was employed is up for debate, but by design this software leaves no evidentiary paper trail, making confirmation one way or the other next to impossible.

Then there is the outright underhandedness. While not necessarily fraud, ethics and fairness do come into serious question.

-Everything in the Wikileaks DNC and Podesta dumps. (This has all been thoroughly covered here.)

-Historically Minimal Debate Schedule (DNC originally only sanctioned 6 debates. Sanders/Clinton ended up having 9, but compare that to 08' when Clinton/Obama faced off 26 times.)

-Near Media Blackout for Sanders during 2015 and into 2016. (In terms of minutes of pre-primary MSN news coverage an estimated 327 minutes went to Trump, 121 minutes to Clinton, and a mere 20 minutes for Sanders despite his surging momentum.)

-Media Bias (To say that the MSM wasn't in the tank for Clinton would be the understatement of the year. See The Washington Compost's 16 hit pieces they ran in one day leading up to Super Tuesday II. Not to mention the media and pundit collusion well documented in the Wikileaks dumps.)

-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held ""open"" primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.

-Super Delegates (The fact that we willfully accept the notion that the vote of indivduals in positions of power count for much more than ours is baffling to me. It's this entirely undemocratic process that saw Clinton walk away with the same amount of pledged delegates as Sanders in a state like Wyoming that healthily won; with SD's included, Clinton walked away from that state, in a losing effort, with an 11 to 7 delegate advantage. Though this ties into media bias, it's worth mentioning that in nearly all MSM coverage, SD's were lumped in with pledged delegates whenever totals were presented to the public, even though SD's didn't cast their votes until the convention. To new and low-information constituents, this deceptive reporting gave the impression that Clinton's lead was always more significant than it actually was; this was done for the seemingly sole purpose of demoralizing the Sanders voting block and stifle upward momentum. As Al Franken pointed out, he felt that due to his political experience he knew what was best for his constituents and would cast his SD vote for Clinton despite his state going for Sanders. Franken was just one of many Reps and Senators that gave the middle finger to the will of their constituency.

-Rallies (Though this is more of a speculative side topic, it can't be ignored. From August 15' through June of 16', even when Sanders had no delegate path to victory, his rallies were attended by hundreds of thousands of indivuals, often filling stadiums to maximum capacity. In contrast, HRC could barely fill a broom closet, let alone a high school gymnasium. Sure, she had a handful of decent turnouts early on, but those number dwindled as the primary carried on, while Sanders' numbers surged in every conceivable way. In one her final rallies in L.A., there were more people protesting outside than HRC supporters inside. Looking at the gross disparity here, something just doesn't pass the smell test.

TL;DR - There was election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary, likely massive, if not an outright coup.

207,I'm am a Active Duty SSG in the U.S Army who is currently refusing the Covid-19 vaccines.,747.0,rhffp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rhffp1/im_am_a_active_duty_ssg_in_the_us_army_who_is/,251.0,1639619513.0,"Edit #1: Just realized I fucked up the title. I'm in the Army...words is hard.

Well. I'm not sure why I'm posting this exactly, (closure/constructive feedback?), all in all I guess I want to share MY opinions on my involvement in this Army over the last 9yrs. 

To start, I've had two combat deployments(Afghanistan-2014/ Iraq 2016-2017). Both of which I'm pretty sure played some extremely minor role in what was actually a natural resource grab by my government. The entire 9months I was in Afghanistan, all I heard about was the ridiculous amount of lithium in the mountains, and the 9months in Iraq was obviously for the oil. Officially,  my unit was in Iraq to push Isis back into Mosul, which we did so successfully. Which,  now knowing how Isis was created in the first place, doesn't entirely sit right with me. Solely because of the fact that the Obama administration funded a rebel group to help overthrow Al-Assad, which didn't play out the way the US had anticipated(or did it), resulting in a heavily armed radical militia that swept the country. 

Let's talk present day:

Currently, the Army has drawn a line in the sand. 
You either get the shot, and stay in. Or, you don't, and you get out. Unless you seek a religious/medical exemption. 

I'm in pretty damn good shape overall, so I don't necessarily meet the prereqs for a medical exemption, and I've never been a man of faith (just to clarify, I have respect for those of you that do, it's just not my thing), and I feel that if I were to lie and seek a religious exemption, just to end up dying and finding out that there is a God...well I feel like that'd just be awkward. So here I am, a vaccine refusal. 

I'm currently barred/flagged from re-enlistment, and I  have also received a Gomor for refusing to get a vaccine. I have to get tested twice a week for The Vid, which honestly brought up some questions on my end for the medics. I had asked the medic oic if the increased frequency of this testing could result in there being a higher susceptibility to the virus. I mean, in my head, them putting a swab all the way up both nostrils twice a week, for an unknown time frame (medics didn't have guidance on how long we're going to be testing). 

Just to clarify, none of this post is in pursuit of pity or anything close to it. I knowingly made these decisions, and I stand by them. Also, I'm not one of those guys that saw this as an ""easy way out"", that's not who I am as a person. I was planning on 20.

All in all, I guess I'm just in a weird spot. 
I grew up in this Army. Joined when I was 18, I'm now 27. I'm aware of things that I just didn't care to know back then, and I can't avoid taking them into consideration. I'm aware of the Military Industrial Complex, I see their products every day. I mean hell, look at the past 3 SecDefs...no conflict of interest there. I'm aware of the cultural changes within the Army over the last 9yrs, and honestly,  it's getting hard to tell if the changes were implemented in the pursuit of creating a more inclusive/aware work environment/force, or if there were sinister intentions. I'm aware of the lobbyists in DC leveraging millions in pursuit of a signed bill. I'm aware of the corrupt politicians that don't give a fuck about us(all of us) unless it's time to boost their approval ratings. I'm aware of the coercion taking place, resulting in people that just joined, not wanting to take the shot, but after being threatened with the very real possibility of immediate separation + having $200,000 student loans over their heads, they complied. The same scenario applies to thousands of members, and you could also replace the ""student loans"" scenario with ""retirement"" and the it's still very much so applicable. I'm concerned. I'm not sure which direction this country that I love is heading, but I keep trying to look at things in an objective manner. And through that lense, it's not looking too promising. I'm aware of agenda 2020 and agenda 2030. I'm aware of the Fourth Industrial Revolution(Klaus Schwab), Operation Lockstep(Rothschilds), and that global depopulation is a shared goal of the ""elites"". I'm just not entirely sure what to make of it all. 

If you made it this far, thanks I guess. It would be interesting to get some feedback. All I ask is that you consider keeping it respectful. Hope all is well with whomever you are, and that you and your people are doing alright out there.",conspiracy,Obama

>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.

*  Do these attempted assassinations require a new mode of thinking in terms of preventing terrorism? How does this situation compare to previous instances of terrorism-by-mail? Have these events instead been an indication that the system is working?
* What, if any, will be the fallout as far as the midterms are concerned? Will politicians seize on this issue as a campaign wedge, or instead use it as a unifying factor?
* Is there responsibility on the part of political actors for these events, or should the actions be viewed as exclusively the isolated actions of terrorists?

This reversal sheds light on a question that is being litigated at large in American politics and, to some degree or another, has existed since the birth of political parties shortly after the founding but has become particularly pronounced in recent years. To what extent should institutional norms or rules be adhered to on a consistent basis? Do those rules and norms provide an important function for government, or are they weaknesses to be exploited for maximum political gain to effectuate preferred change? Should the Senate particularly, and Congress in general, limit itself only to consistency when it comes to Supreme Court decisions regarding constitutional requirements, or is the body charged with more responsibility?

While Trump's infamous interview with Jake Tapper did look awful and he gave very strange, evasive answers, the media and opposing candidates have used it to continuously lie that Trump has never disavowed Duke at all.

Similarly, when Obama first ran in 2008, he was constantly pressured by the media and Hillary to disavow his own extremist endorsements, such as Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan and Bill Ayres. I'm sure most people who followed politics back then remember the great speech he gave about race relations in this country in response to the controversy that followed him on the campaign trail.

 **Research in Motion Ltd - 3,000**


These layoffs were announced in June of 2012. Not because of the economy but because they create a product that has lost demand since other competitors have sold more goods:

**Providence Journal - 23**


This is a newspaper that has seen its circulation decline from 90,085 to 83,733 in a year's time. They have been regularly laying off employees like every other newspaper across the country as less Americans get their news from newspapers and choose to get it free from the Internet and television: 
http://www2.turnto10.com/business/2012/nov/08/providence-journal-announces-more-layoffs-ar-1233784/

 **Hawker Beechcraft - 410**

This company declared bankruptcy last year and sold to a chinese company in July of 2011. This recent round of layoffs was 170 people and their business has been in decline since 2008. They make luxury private jets for rich people and I'm assuming the rich can only own a certain amount of private luxury jets at one time:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120802/us-hawker-beechcraft-layoffs/


 **Boeing 61,000**

Boeing expanded it's business dramatically during the Iraq war with HUGE contracts with the defense department. As the war came to a close, they saw their business decline. I guess if you want constant war, Boeing would always be making billions from the government but this is their official statement: ""Boeing said the changes were *not* a response to the threat of additional, across-the-board U.S. budget cuts due to take effect on January 2, or the outcome of U.S. elections, but represented another step in its continuing drive to ""be more competitive while investing in technologies and people.""
So the company itself is deying it has anything to do with the presidential elections and that they layoffs were planned and expected:

 **CVPH Medical Center - 17**

This hospital received $3.2 million dollars in federal grant money to keep their doors open but their expenses exceeded their revenues by more than $400,000. They simply don't know how to run a business apparently. 
http://www.cvph.org/news-and-events/news-detail.aspx?newsid=45

 **US Cellular - 980**

This was the result of a sale of a company to a competitor. Sprint (cell phone company) purchased US Cellular to eliminate a competitor in a certain market. This was a planned sale that took place over the past month, it just happened to be announced on Wednesday. It takes longer than one day to sell a mult-million dollar company:
http://www.wirelessweek.com/News/2012/11/carriers-Sprint-Buys-US-Cellular-Midwest-Markets-for-480M/

 **Commerzbank - 6,000**

This is the funniest one so far. This is a bank from Germany and Poland that has absolutely no connection to the U.S. or Obama In looking for official layoff reports, I found this statement from the bank from Nov. 8 where they announced they are investing $2 BILLION euros in their company. Sounds like growth to me.

 **Iberia - 7,000**

This is the second funniest because it's an airline out of SPAIN that has no connections (or jobs) to the U.S. Spain's economy has been sinking harder that the U.S. since 2007. Absolutely no connection to America or Obama:
http://www.theworld.org/2012/11/spains-iberia-airlines-announces-layoffs/

 **Momentive Performance Materials - 150**

This is a TEMPORARY LAYOFF. All of these jobs will be reinstated in two weeks, as reported by the owner of the company here:

These layoffs were disclosed on Oct. 29. I'm afraid that was a full week BEFORE Obama's re-election. Absolutely no connection here:
http://www.tylerstarnews.com/page/content.detail/id/508789/Momentive-Inc--plans-temporary-layoffs-for-150.html?nav=5008

 **Gameforge Berlin - 20**

I'm not even looking this up. If people are stupid and desperate enough to blame Obama for the layoff of 20 people in Berlin, Germany, they are idiots. But then again, I wonder if they even realize that Berlin is in Germany and not in America. Probably not.

 **Vestas Wind Systems 1,700**

Huge lie. First sentence in this story reports the layoffs to be 200 and not 1,700. Blatant lie there. It should be noted that this is a company from Denmark and not an American company. EDIT: I stand corrected on this as I found a quote from the article: *The combined layoffs, plus some attrition and relocations, have reduced Vestas' Colorado workforce from 1,700 to 1,200 this year.* So we can assume the total number of employees is 1,700 (the amount the email suggests was laid off) and that the numbers laid off amount to 500.
http://www.denverpost.com/recommended/ci_21754574

 **Husqvarna - 390**

This is a company based in Sweden, again absolutely no connection to Obama or the U.S. In fact, the  majority of those affected are in Sweden or where their products are made in Poland:
http://www.appliancemagazine.com/news.php?article=1626614&zone=0&first=1

**Ericsson - 14,000**

This is another funny one. Ericsson is a Swedish company (like Husqvarna) and those layoffs are in Sweden. They are not 14,000, they are 1,550. Pretty big difference:
http://www.i4u.com/2012/11/sony-ericsson/ericsson-swedens-job-announces-cuts

 **SRA International - 222**

http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/11/06/sra-international-to-lay-off-222-in.html

 **PerkinElmer - 75**

This company is moving operations overseas to save money on having to pay Americans a livable wage. The governor of MA tried to talk them into keeping the jobs in America but the company refused to discuss it with them before making the decision to outsource their jobs:

 **Majestic Star Casino and Hotel - 80**

THIS is a company trying to destroy their union. Their workers are in a union and their contract ran out Oct. 31st. The company has made more money this year than they did last year but they are still cutting jobs despite making more money. A quote from the union representative: “These out-of-state owners who control billions are coming to Indiana and taking away our jobs,” said Coleman. It is also worth mentioning that these layoffs were *announced* on Nov. 6th *before* the election was officially over and anyone knew who won.

**Lower Bucks Hospital - 500**

This is one of the biggest lies: THIRTY people were laid off. 30. Not 500. And the layoffs occurred on NOV.5, THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. People who believe this stuff are idiots. Ironically, the CEO mentions in this article that they have **750** people on the payroll. Eliminating 500 of those seems kind of out of the question.

http://levittown.patch.com/articles/lower-bucks-hospital-lays-off-30-employees

 **Oce North America - 9**

I couldn't find a single news article to back this up with any kind of facts at all. Enough said.

 **Corning United Blood Services Gulf - 150**

Again, there is absolutely not a single news story to back this claim up anywhere. If it happened, there would be a press release. Right wing blogs are announcing this with NO reference or citation.

 **Atlantic Lottery Corporation - 16**

This is a Canadian company and these layoffs were announced NOV. 5th, a DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION.

 **Welch Allyn - 10% of manufacturing work force**

These layoffs were announce on September 10th, almost two full months before Obama was re-elected. These are going to take place over THE NEXT THREE YEARS in a restructuring effort:
http://www.qmed.com/news/welch-allyn-initiates-global-restructuring-including-layoffs

 **Dana Holding - 12% of work force**

This is a total lie as well. The company released a financial report on Oct. 29th, 2012 and only said they were considering layoffs with NO specific numbers mentioned. The only place I can find this is on rightwing blogs, again, with no citations or references to any specifics. The company's report on Oct. 29th announced NO layoffs.
http://thurbersthoughts.blogspot.com/2012/10/dana-considering-layoffs-as-obamacare.html

 **Stryker - approx 5%**

These were announced on June 25, 2012  and it's in response to trying to compensate for a new 2.3% tax on medical devices as part of the new health care act. I don't have to tell you how little 2.3% is and there is also no indiction that it would be 5% of it's employee force. The latest news says 'more than 100' positions would be laid off.

http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/ArticleEmail.aspx?id=64753

 **Abbott Labs - 550**

Announced on October 17th, about TWO SOLID WEEKS before Obama was re-elected. The facts hurt, I guess: Half of these workers being laid off are in EUROPE. Even though they are laying these people off, the overall amount of workers at Abbott Labs has grown due to additional acquisitions of other companies. Full story here:
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-labs-cuts-550-jobs-more-layoffs-planned-2012-10-17

 **Covidien - 600**

This is funny. The company denies any reports of layoffs in May of this year, no real news of layoffs since then:

 **Kinetic Concepts - 300**

This was announced on JULY 13th, 2012 as part of restructuring after a $6.3 billion dollar buyout in 2011.
http://www.massdevice.com/news/report-kinetic-concepts-lays-300-more

**St. Jude - 300**

This was announced NOV. 2, FOUR DAYS before Obama was re-elected. I wonder if Romney would have won if these lunatics would be blaming Romney for the job losses that occurred 4 days before anyone knew who was going to be the next president: It should also be noted that the company blames poor sales of defibrillators and pacemakers, not on the economy.
http://www.startribune.com/business/176871351.html?refer=y

 **Hill Rom - 200**

This is ANOTHER company where the right wing blogs continue to report a layoff in these numbers (200) where there is absolutely no real news source or citation for this. Repeating something over and over doesn't make it true. Just look at Fox: They said Romney would be elected for the past month 1,000 times. Didn't make it so. I would put a source but since there is no source for this, I will leave it alone

 **Darden Restaurants - 3%**

This is the company that owns Red Lobster and the Olive Garden. All they are doing is cutting back hours so they aren't forced to cover employees' medical insurance. Typical big business: Just like Walmart: Wring your workers out for all you can get, work them JUST under the amount of hours where they would be provided some kind of health care security. Just a shitty company more than anything else but no reflection of the election at all but more of an attack on the new healthcare law.

 **JANCOA - 350**

Utter lies. Jancoa is a janitorial outfit in Cincinnati, OH whose owner testified against the new health care law in congress. Funny that this reports she is laying off 350 workers when the owner herself REPORTS THAT THE ENTIRE COMPANY EMPLOYS 320 PEOPLE. Absolutely no layoffs reported anywhere from this company as of Nov. 9, 2012. Maybe it's republicans' wishful thinking?

Some of these pardons have been controversial due to the connections to President Trump himself, such as the pardons of longtime ally Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Some have seen this as President Trump nullifying the results of the investigation into his 2016 campaign and subsequently laying the groundwork for future presidential campaigns to ignore laws, safe in the knowledge that all sentences will be commuted if anyone involved is caught.

Others were seen as controversial due to the nature of the original crime, such as the pardon of Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, convicted to life in prison by the Justice Department for his role in the killing of 17 Iraqi civilians, including several women and 2 children.

My question is - which of past President Barack Obama’s pardons caused similar levels of controversy, or were seen as similarly indefensible? How do they compare to the recent pardon’s from President Trump?

She is also famous for being the face of the response to the [*2012 Benghazi attack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack)*,* and being widely criticized by Republicans for incorrectly attributing the motives of the attacks.

More context on the arguments for and against earmarks from [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Earmarks):

> Critics [of earmarks] argue that the ability to earmark federal funds should not be part of the legislative appropriations process. These same critics argue that tax money should be applied by federal agencies according to objective findings of need and carefully constructed requests, rather than being earmarked arbitrarily by elected officials.[3]

> Supporters of earmarks, however, feel that elected officials are better able to prioritize funding needs in their own districts and states. They believe it is more democratic for these officials to make discreet funding decisions than have these decisions made by unelected civil servants. Proponents say earmarks are good for consumers and encourage bipartisanship in Congress.[4]

Additionally, Trump just tweeted 

>3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!

Could he actively work to sabotage Obamacare? Is there a politically viable path for Republicans and Dems to come together and stabilize the current Obamacare?

One last question: The process of crafting this bill was widely derided by both Democrats and Republicans. Republicans from McCain to Johnson to Paul criticized McConnell and Republican leadership for the secretive way the bill was put together. McConnell apparently didn't even know where all his Senators would fall up to the last minute - as seen by the fact that VP Mike Pence was flown in and stood around the senate for about an hour as it became obvious that he did not in fact have the votes. Does McConnell failure to get this passed jeopardize his leadership - and is there anyone who would have the support of Republicans to replace him as majority leader?

George Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" speech is the major one that comes to mind from his time in office.

>It was the first time that the White House had ordered military action against forces loyal to Mr. Assad.

>The speed with which the Trump administration responded — and remarks earlier in the day by American officials who said that options were still being considered — appeared intended to maximize the element of surprise and sharply contrasted with the methodical scrutiny of the use of force by the Obama administration.

>It was Mr. Trump’s first order to the military for the use of force — other operations in Syria, Yemen and Iraq had been carried out under authorization delegated to his commanders — and appeared intended to send a message to North Korea, Iran and other potential adversaries that the new commander in chief was prepared to act, and sometimes on short notice.


What impact will this have on the situation in Syria and American foreign policy as a whole? 


How will the Syrian government most likely respond?


What does this say about President Trump's philosophy regarding the use of military force, how does it compare to that of his predecessor, and how could it play out in potential conflicts with ""adversaries"" like North Korea and Iran?


How should the United States deal with the Syrian Civil War? Should they increase their direct involvement in the crisis, perhaps to the point of a military presence on the scale of Iraq or Afghanistan?

Here are more components listed from the press release:

 - Prohibits federal, state, and local law enforcement from racial, religious and discriminatory profiling, and mandates training on racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling for all law enforcement.  
 - Bans chokeholds, carotid holds and no-knock warrants at the federal level and limits the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement.  
 - Mandates the use of dashboard cameras and body cameras for federal offices and requires state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.  
 - Establishes a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problematic officers who are fired or leave on agency from moving to another jurisdiction without any accountability.  
 - Amends federal criminal statute from “willfulness” to a “recklessness” standard to successfully identify and prosecute police misconduct.  
 - Reforms qualified immunity so that individuals are not barred from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional rights.  
 - Establishes public safety innovation grants for community-based organizations to create local commissions and task forces to help communities to re-imagine and develop concrete, just and equitable public safety approaches.  
 - Creates law enforcement development and training programs to develop best practices and requires the creation of law enforcement accreditation standard recommendations based on President Obama’s Task force on 21st Century policing.  
 - Requires state and local law enforcement agencies to report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion, age.  
 - Improves the use of pattern and practice investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power and creates a grant program for state attorneys general to develop authority to conduct independent investigations into problematic police departments.  
 - Establishes a Department of Justice task force to coordinate the investigation, prosecution and enforcement efforts of federal, state and local governments in cases related to law enforcement misconduct.

He polled differently, he campaigned differently in 2016, and he was unlike most of any candidate who ran for president when becoming president. He was just not what most people had in mind when running a movement, which is probably why most pundits and analysts have written him off initially.

That being said, this year I've been studying up on the office of the presidency, and the previous inhabitants of the office. It seems most common-sense pathways to the oval office require some sort of federal leadership. For example, such as ultimately being a governor of a state, or it's a senator seat.

Barack Obama was a sitting senator from Illinois. First-term politician too.

John McCain was a senator from Arizona when he clinched the Republican party nomination. 

Joe Biden was a senator from Delaware when he was elected to the vice-presidency and vice-president when he was elected to the presidency. 

Sarah Palin was a governor of Alaska when she ran for vice-president. 

Bernie Sanders was a senator from Vermont. 

Mitt Romney was a governor from Massachusetts. 

Ted Cruz was a senator from Texas.

Marco Rubio was a senator from Florida.

George W. Bush was a governor from Texas, and also had the good faith to run in his father's name.

Some voting statistics on New Mexico:

In the 2012 Presidential election, Obama beat Romney by about 10%.  Gary Johnson pulled in about 3.5% in the state, a stronger percent than his national average of 1%, but still quite low for someone who was governor of the state twice. (53-43-3.5%) 

In 2012, Martin Heinrich, the now incumbent Democrat Senator from New Mexico, [won with a roughly 6% lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich) over his Republican opponent (51-45%).

* **Policy Direction.** I would say this is the theory [endorsed by](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/opinion/bernie-sanders-where-the-democrats-go-from-here.html) Bernie Sanders (among others). The premise is that Democrats lost because they didn't offer the right policy subscriptions to help bolster the middle class.

* **Identity Politics.** After the election, some [argued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-identity-politics-couldnt-clinch-a-clinton-win/2016/11/11/ed3bf966-a773-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html?utm_term=.db254ba823f9) that Democrats went wrong by leaning too heavily on ""indentity politics,"" loosely defined as making appeals to specific identity groups.

* **Candidate.** I hear this theory less, but the basic idea is that the Democratic Party is in a fine place in terms of policy and direction but that they just ran the wrong candidate. According to the argument, an Obama-like candidate could have run on the same platform and won the election handily against Trump.

* **Culture.** I would say Josh Barro's [article today](http://www.businessinsider.com/liberals-can-win-if-they-stop-being-so-annoying-2017-7) encapsulates this article. A main idea of this theory is that large swaths of the country are rebelling against ""coastal elites"" and the associated liberal culture.

Here are some questions to that end:

* What's at the root of this anxiety?

* Is this anxiety ""legitimate""? Is it people simply failing to adjust to the times, or are circumstances such that people can no longer succeed like they could in the past?

* Is Brooks right that the rise of these candidates represents a failure of the establishment?

* While this highly dissatisfied segment may be a minority of America, it's a very substantial one comprising tens of millions of citizens. Do these citizens deserve vindication via policy, or would they be better off accepting the solutions proposed by more traditional politicians (e.g. Hillary proposing a continuation of Obama's policies)?

Here is the gist:

> The President laid out his first proposed use of that authority consolidating six agencies into one more efficient agency… The six are: U.S. Department of Commerce’s core business and trade functions, the Small Business Administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.

> the Office of the Trade Representative is the “honest broker,” a role that would be impossible for it to play as part of the parochial Commerce Department. The Office of the Trade Representative’s ability to fulfill this function is now assured by its position as part of the executive office of the president. This allows it to take the broad view of what is in the best interest of the country as a whole and bargain with our trading partners in good faith… It is a small agency; there are no efficiency gains to be realized by making it another bureau within Commerce… placing the Office of the Trade Representative within Commerce will inevitably politicize the office.

Do you see any way out for Democrats with only a few months until November? Or is a fait compli? Can candidate quality matter in swing states? How should Republicans view this strong historical correlation?

Fewer pundits are as confident about control of the Senate, but Democrats only need +2 to regain the majority (even a 50/50 split would give them enormous bargaining power, considering McCain will probably be out of the Senate chamber most of the time as his cancer progresses, so Republicans won't be able to rely on his vote too much).

Given this, it's not far fetched to start thinking about what happens if the House and Senate go blue in 2018. How will the Democrats work with President Trump? Will we see a rehash of Obama's relationship with the GOP, marked by mutual distrust and stalling and very little legislation passing? Or could there be a strong working relationship, like Clinton had with the GOP majority in the 90s?

And it has made me wonder if he is right. Are we in a post-persusain age? Despite what people say, polarization is nothing new in US Politics. After the Civil War, when Andrew Johnson was speaking in Indianpolis, a riot between supporters and opponents broke out and one person was shot. 

We remained bitterly divided over race, over women's suffrage, over drug use, over war, over the culture.

Add on to it the promise that other nations would pay for it all, and it may come off as another Trump bamboozle.

If the United States were to begin working with Turkey, however, to clear out ISIS from Syria (a plan articulated by the Turks yesterday), would this not change the situation significantly inside Syria?  Turkey has been working with Assad's Syrian government and Russia for months now, and so this operation would essentially align American foreign-policy objectives with those of Russia and Assad's Syria, and could even allow the United States an avenue for involvement without forming an outright alliance with Russia.

&nbsp;
 
""Preferential voting or ranked voting describes certain voting systems in which voters rank outcomes in a hierarchy on the ordinal scale (ordinal voting systems)."" (from Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_system). The only two types of ranked choice voting systems that are currently being used in governmental elections are instant-runoff voting (IRV), and single transferable vote (STV). STV is only used in multiple-seat races, as in, where a single vote decides the outcomes of multiple seats, as in therefore not relevant for this question. 

&nbsp;
 
**IRV:** IRV is used in single seat election where there are more than two candidates, and works in the following way. “Instead of voting only for a single candidate, in IRV, voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's top choice. If a candidate secures more than half of these votes, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate in last place is eliminated and removed from consideration. The top remaining choices on all the ballots are then counted again. This process repeats until one candidate is the top remaining choice of a majority of the voters. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an ""instant runoff"" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.” (from Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting)

&nbsp;
 
For context, IRV is used in Australia at the federal and state levels, in the UK, New Zealand, and some cities (Oakland, CA from 2010-present, San Francisco, CA from 2004-present) in the US. It was also adopted by the US state of Maine as of the 2016 election, and will apply to races for Congress, Governor, and State Legislature from 2018 onwards. To read more on Maine, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html).

&nbsp;
 
**Context in US Politics:**

&nbsp;
 
Ranked choice voting also has at least some bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats, with both 2008 Presidential Candidates (then Senators McCain and Obama) supporting the effort (source - an OP-ED written by Howard Dean, the former DNC chairman, Governor of Vermont, and Presidential Candidate - https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/opinion/howard-dean-how-to-move-beyond-the-two-party-system.html?_r=0). Among candidates in the 2016 election, ranked choice voting was supported by Senator Bernie Sanders (from previous article), and not discussed by the two major party candidates (as far as I could see, happy to be proven wrong here, just send me a PM or comment a source saying otherwise and I’ll change this).

&nbsp;

**Questions:** 

&nbsp;

My questions therefore are:

•	What are the positives and negatives of Ranked Choice Voting?

•	Would the benefits of Ranked Choice Voting outweigh the negatives in US Congressional, Senate, and Presidential races?

•	How likely is it that Ranked Choice Voting could be implemented in the either US States, or nationally? If likely, or even possible, how would this change occur?

**How to watch:** 

* The official livestream will be [here](https://www.demconvention.com/watch-the-convention/). It will also be available on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/demconvention), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/demconvention), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/demconvention) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/demconvention).

* ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will air the convention from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. each night. C-SPAN, CNN, MSNBC and PBS will cover the full two hours each night.

**Speakers:**


* Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee and former secretary of state. Four years ago, she appeared onscreen to the sound of breaking glass before being nominated herself. This time, she will be speaking on behalf of the man she hopes can beat Mr. Trump where she could not.

* Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, the nominal home of the convention. He narrowly defeated Scott Walker, the Republican incumbent, for the governorship in 2018, two years after Mr. Trump won the state.

* Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Almost killed in a mass shooting in 2011, she has since become one of the United States’ most vocal advocates for stricter gun laws, and her husband, Mark Kelly, is the Democratic candidate for Senate in Arizona.

* Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate. She is the first woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket and will be looking to energize Black voters, the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituency.

* Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. She is the first Latina Democrat to lead any state and was a vice-presidential contender, and like several other governors, she received some national attention for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.

* Former President Barack Obama. More than anyone else in the Democratic Party, he is seen as a potential uniter of the party’s moderate and progressive factions. He did not weigh in publicly while the primary was competitive, but he has become more active on the campaign trail (or what remains of it) since endorsing Mr. Biden in April.

* Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She has been on the front lines of the ongoing legislative fights with the Trump administration over coronavirus relief and funding for the United States Postal Service.

* Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She and Senator Bernie Sanders, who spoke on Monday, were the two most prominent progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, and she was on Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential shortlist.

Obviously the situation was a little different, because Brown's win gave the Republicans the 41st seat that they needed to break the Democrats' filibuster proof majority in the Senate. But the rationale for scaling back reform was that it was politically unpopular, as evidence by opinion polling and the results of a special election, where a Republican had won in a very liberal state.

So my question is: If Ossoff wins in Georgia, and especially if he wins by more than the polls are predicting, do you think Senate Republicans might decide to tap the brakes on health care reform?

It worked well with Republicans in the 2010 and 2014 midterms against Democrats with Obama and it also worked successfully with Democrats tying the GOP to Trump in 2018.

Currently, president Biden is polling in the low 40s in job approval and his numbers are worse on the economy, inflation, immigration and crime, among the top issues that are of concern to voters. Do you think that Democrats are vulnerable to being seen as Biden cheerleaders in the upcoming election battle as in Congressman X voted with Biden 97% of the time who wants to advance the Biden agenda on America.

How effective would this tactic be for the GOP? Does Biden have vulnerabilities that are similar to what took out Obama and Trump in past midterms? Is there a way to innoculate a candidate from this kind of attack?",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama
100,It seems to me that Republicans' position on replacing Scalia would be stronger if they were just honest about it.,341.0,46ldoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/46ldoi/it_seems_to_me_that_republicans_position_on/,378.0,1455898869.0,"Instead of trying to argue that a president shouldn't try to submit a nominee in an election year, Republicans should just admit that they don't want Obama to nominate a liberal justice and tilt the balance of the Court, and vote down any nominees they disapprove of; this seems like a better strategy for several reasons.

1. There's *no question* that the Senate has the authority to reject the president's nominees, while the president clearly has the authority to nominate a replacement as long as he's in office.

2. The Senate has no real power to stop the president from nominating someone and forcing their hand.

3. Stalling the vote on Obama's nominee until after the election would be historically unprecedented, almost tripling the previous record for the longest confirmation process. However, if they just keep rejecting his nominees, the vacancy wouldn't even be the longest in recent history.

4. If they argue that the people should have an input on who the next justice is, the obvious response is that they did, in 2012. On the other hand, if they just reject his nominees, they can make the argument that they themselves were elected to advance and defend conservative values, which is exactly what they're doing.

5. If they submit a short list of qualified conservative justices, or even a list of criteria they want a nominee to meet, they put the ball in Obama's court; in other words, if he continues to submit nominees he knows they won't accept, they can make the argument that *he* is the one who is being ""obstructionist"".

6. Similarly, letting him know what replacements *would* be acceptable to them gives them a defense against anyone who claims they're opposing Obama just because he's Obama.

7. If a Democrat wins this year's election, the argument about nominees in an election year completely falls apart.

8. It wouldn't leave Republican candidates for president open to the obvious question of whether they'd refuse to nominate someone in an election year. If a vacancy opens on the Supreme Court when the Senate and the Presidency are controlled by opposing parties, *of course* the president is going to try to skew it in his direction, and *of course* the Senate is going to resist.

To me, it seems like the smartest thing for Republican Senators to do would be to not say anything until Obama actually nominates someone, reject a couple of his nominees, and then tell him exactly what kind of nominee they *would* approve, telling anyone who asks that they're just doing their job, and that they're not *obligated* to confirm his nominees.

From a constitutional standpoint, they'd have a much stronger case based on separation of powers: if the president skews the Court towards him, it will be less capable of checking his power, and Senate had to approve any nominee, the president might as well just appoint justices directly.",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been the leader of Senate Republicans since 2007 and was Majority Leader from 2017 to 2020. However, many conservatives and Republicans have been dissatisfied with his reign seeing that he embodies what is the so-called Washington Establishment. Meaning, that McConnell often sides against his more conservative colleagues in order to have a functioning Senate even if it means dealing with Democrats and moderate Republicans to clinch deals rather than holding out for more conservative legislation.

This can be seen in his dealings with president Obama over the debt ceiling crisis of 2011, the Sen. Ted Cruz-led government shutdown in 2013 and his willingness to pass omnibus spending packages with mostly Democratic votes even when he was in the majority under president Trump.

What this means is that McConnell has always had among the lowest approval ratings of any prominent federal political leader. Unlike then-Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Chuck Schumer who were/are approved by their party's base, McConnell always had significant disapproval from within his own party, coming mostly from conservative, anti-establishment types.

The critique these conservatives make is that McConnell is somewhat of a squish as opposed to a stalwart of conservative values. Whereas Democrats would rarely ever make deals with Republicans on legislation that conservatives wanted like building a border wall or cutting government spending, McConnell was all too often open to working with Democrats to expand immigration or increase government pork over the objections of most Republicans. In fact, he'd work with mostly Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans to pass legislation presidents Obama and Biden favored. That was not the case with president Trump, who was stiffed by Pelosi and Schumer in funding conservative priorities.

What do you make of the complaint by some conservatives that McConnell has not been an effective leader for Senate Republicans? Fair or not? Do you think he stays in leadership under a Republican president in 2024? What about his reelection in 2026 when he'd be 86 years old?",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama

1.) Launch national campaign to get states to expand Medicaid.  
  
2.) Allow eligible families to buy on the exchanges, regardless of immigration status.  
  
3.) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to block or modify unreasonable health insurance premium rate increases.  
  
4.) She has already laid out plans to address drug costs and increasing out-of-pocket expenses. 
  
5.) Public Option  
  
6.) Expand Medicare by allowing people 55 years to buy in.  
  
7.) Expand funding to Federally Qualified Health Centers to $40 Billion over 10 years.  
  
8.) Supports President Obama’s call for a near tripling of the size of the National Health Service Corps . 
  
  
I like a lot of these idea. She incorporated a few Sanders proposals. Some things that stand out:   
  
1.) If she managed to bring back the public option would be huge. 
  
2.) Expand Medicare to 55, I like this idea. Medicare beneficiaries that opt in would pay the premium. However, at 55 you're still a fairly healthy adult with few chronic conditions/illness. 
  
3.) Not sure how much industry will like government controlled rate regulation. I can't imagine that would pass.  
  
4.) $$$ for FQHC's, this is an amazing and much needed investment all things considering. I think this would have strong bipartisan support. The federal government would be directing a major influx of funding to community clinics for prevention. I want this to happen ASAP. 
  
5.) I think illegal immigrants should be able to purchase on the exchanges, however, they shouldn't be eligible for subsidies. I don't think this will pass though, unless the Democrats get a favorable immigration bill.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-map-looked-a-lot-like-2012-and-that-got-me-thinking-about-2020/

One strategy is a ""Northern Path"", trying to win back the upper northwest, focusing on winning back PA, MI, and WI, with IA and OH being reach states.

Another strategy would be the ""Sunbelt Strategy""- trying to win traditionally Republican States that had been trending blue. This plan would focus on AZ, NC, FL, with TX and GA being reach states.

Presumably, these targets have different ideal strategies. Going for the Northern Path states would require winning back White Working Classes voter that flipped from supporting Obama to supporting Trump, so probably best message would be one that focused on economic populism.

The Sunbelt strategy would require continuing democratic progress in well educated suburbs and maximizing minority turnout. It's been the suggested that a candidate for this strategy would try to maximize appeal to the democratic base, and focus heavily on social and racial justice.

What do you all think is the most promising strategy? Obviously they will try to compete everywhere, but given that these areas may be receptive to different messages- what should they make the priority?

Conversely, what options do Trump and the Republicans have to counter these strategies?

EDIT: I am seeing a number of replies of saying ""All Of them"" as to what states to campaign in. Clearly, each campaign is going to go for any state they have a chance at, and so it's likely both parties will contest all of the States I mentioned. The extent of where the Democrats would have to choose a priority is in the primary- if different candidates are seen as better fit for different regions. For example, nominating someone like Biden or Sherrod Brown might give the best chance at the upper midwest, where as nominating someone like Kamala Harris might be better for winning over suburban voters and maximizing minority turnout, putting states like NC into play.

Obamacare as well as most of the advancements in LGBT rights that were made during his presidency are starting to look early on like they aren't going anywhere, and probably two of the biggest achievements he'll be known for along with leaving office with very high approval ratings and having an exceptionally stable tenure compared to most presidents. I think if there's one area it's hardly controversial to point out as a shortcoming in his administration, it was an overly soft-handed approach to foreign policy, much against the advice of some Republicans (Pulling out of Iraq, laughing at Romney for saying Russia is a threat, Red Line in the sand, a continued kick the can down the road policy with NK).

Many of these counties were Obama-Trump counties. My question is essentially why did they vote for Obama in the first place. If you look at a map of the results for [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2012nationwidecountymapshadedbypercentagewon.svg), this area was abnormally strong for Obama. More than that, voters in these counties were the ones who led Obama to victory in Iowa and Wisconsin. To put how strange this is into context, Iowa is the 15th most rural state—more rural than West Virginia, Arkansas, and Missouri.

To add even more weirdness to this area being Democrat—it's not ancestrally Democrat.

[1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1960nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Republican

[1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1964nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Democrat—this was a landslide year

[1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1968nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Republican

[1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1972nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Republican

[1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1976nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Republican—Despite the close margins in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, the driftless area was Carter's weakest area

[1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1988nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Kinda Democrat—the counties that voted D this election don't quite match up with later elections; probably due to the farming crisis that led many Midwestern farmers to vote D

[1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1992nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Democrat

[1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:1996nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Democrat

[2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election#/media/File:2000nationwidecountymapshadedbyvoteshare.svg): Democrat

&#x200B;

To add even a bit more weirdness, a lot of voters in this area aren't even exactly socially conservative, economically liberal voters. According to pew, A majority of Iowans, a rural state whose democratic counties entirely fall within the ""driftless area"", actually support [abortion](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/) and [stricter environmental regulations](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/iowa/). These people are liberal all-round! (or at least more of them are than surrounding areas).

&#x200B;

\-One thing I found is that the core of the area exhibits a lower percent of people who adhere to Evangelical Protestantism and a greater percentage of people who adhere to Mainline Protestantism which can be seen in [this map](https://i0.wp.com/arilamstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iowaneighbors.png?ssl=1). However, there are parts of the area that have higher Evangelical Protestantism and there areas that have lower Evangelical Protestantism that still vote very Republican.

\-Another thing is that the area of western Wisconsin that votes Democrat also had historical Norwegian settlement and has [higher Norwegian ancestry](https://www.google.com/search?q=norwegian+ancestry+map&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ACYBGNSc_umovb82-_L6i4mEo39TvdtqRA:1576912892032&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZtJWmmsbmAhWXvp4KHY0ACuMQ_AUoAXoECA8QAw&biw=1400&bih=781#imgrc=7eZpILB7mSislM:), but this does not extend to other parts of the ""Driftless Area"" and even higher Norwegian areas in Minnesota and the Dakotas are Republican.

Clinton's RCP average over Trump in Virginia as of right now is over 11 points, and it was one of the few states where Rubio nearly beat Trump.

What is the reason for this? My take is that Virginia republicans are very different than republicans from more conservative states. In Virginia, many tend to live in the Fairfax/DC metro area and are fiscally conservative for tax and spending reasons, but are socially liberal. They tend to be high income and high education, and I think the increasing ""low brow"" base of the GOP turns them off - especially Trump.

I feel like Virginia represents the inability for the GOP to win the presidency. Until they can win this state again, I don't think they can win nationally for two reasons. 1 - Electorally, they NEED Virginia in order to win. Without it, the path narrows significantly and even with OH and FL they would need to win 2/3 western swing states (NV, NM, and CO), which is difficult as hispanics grow in number and are turned off by the GOP. 2 - It represents the inability to win those moderate, suburban Republicans.

>I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.

>Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology...Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum- based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.

>Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't. I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.

**-Mitt Romney**

> My administration will foster democracy and level barriers to trade. If elected, my goal will be free trade agreements with all the nations of Latin America. We can do so in cooperation with our NAFTA partners. We should also do so with Chile, and Brazil and Argentina, the anchor states of Mercosur. We will also work toward free trade with the smaller nations of Central America and the Caribbean.

**-George W. Bush, reported by AP, Oct 31, 2000**


>Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn't. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.

**-Mitt Romney**


>We must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009--and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years.

>And then let's take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.

**-Mitt Romney**


>We cut the taxes on the small business owners.	If you want the small business sector to grow, if you recognize two-thirds of new jobs are created by small businesses, it makes sense to let small businesses keep more of the money they make. After all, when a small business owner has got more money in his or her treasury, you're likely to expand your business. You talk to some of these business -- the folks who won the business award, I said, how many jobs -- how many employees did you have five years ago and how many do you have today?

Yes, one could probably do something similar with any two candidates by taking quotes out of context.

# What is the ""Great Wall Of Bernie"" and what does it predict?

In [July 2015](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/), Nate Silver predicted that Bernie could win Iowa and New Hampshire yet still lose everywhere else. To demonstrate why, he looked at 2008 exit polls showing which states had the most Democrats self-identifying as Liberal and/or White. The top three states were Iowa, New Hampshire and Vermont. 

###[**The ""Great Wall of Bernie"" Chart**](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/silver-datalab-bernieland.png)

Nate predicted that if Sanders did not win Iowa and New Hampshire in landslides, that could foreshadow crushing losses for him in the more ""diverse"" and politically moderate areas of the country, unless he could win more of the minority vote.

Now that Iowa and New Hampshire have voted, we can begin testing Nate's thesis.

# How can we transfer the IA/NH results to the nationwide White electorate to estimate Sanders' final White vote?

Let's imagine a gymnasium filled with **1000 typical 2008 Democratic Primary voters.** 

Now, [about **650 of them are White**](http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf) (and 358 of those White voters support Clinton '08). We don't have any solid info about non-Whites yet, but we can start to tell what those 650 White voters would think of Bernie.

I'm going to use multiple methods to estimate Sanders' current White support ***nationwide*** based on the *characteristics* of his White supporters as seen in the 2 states that have voted so far. [Let's break it down!](http://media2.giphy.com/media/kgKrO1A3JbWTK/giphy.gif)

- **AGE** How old are our 650 White voters from 2008? We know that seventy are under 30. Sanders won 84% of White under-30s in the early states, so we'll give him fifty-nine of these voters. Similarly, 130 of the Whites in our gym are over 65 - Sanders is averaging just 35% with these voters, so we'll give him 45 supporters here. And the remaining 450 Whites in our gym are middle aged. Sanders so far has averaged just about half of these voters - we'll give him 225 supporters. So according to the age breakdown, Sanders should have **329 White supporters**.

- **EDUCATION** I'll spare you the math, but based on a similar breakdown of White college grads vs. non-grads, we can estimate Sanders has **354 White supporters** in the gym (he does best among non-grads).

- **INCOME** And a similar breakdown of income estimates his support at **348 White fans** (he does best among those with lower family incomes).

- **POPULAR VOTE** Sanders has won 59% of the popular vote so far. Imagining that *""roughly"" all* these IA and NH voters have been White, we can translate that ratio to **385 White supporters** in our gym. This highball figure represents the fact that many more people voted in NH than IA, and Sanders of course did better in NH. If you believe Sanders benefited from being a native of next-door VT, discount this estimate.

The long story short is that we can see Bernie has something like **345** White supporters in the ""2008 gym"" which leaves 305 White supporters for Clinton. So Bernie is doing much better than Obama (or Clinton '16 is doing worse than Clinton '08) with White voters. Of course, 345 is not 500. Bernie needs 155 non-White supporters to form a majority coalition. With some quick math, we can get a % figure:

##*Bernie needs to win about* ***44.3%*** *of Democratic non-White voters!*

**It is difficult to overstate how terrible this projected goal is for Sanders.** In most polls his support among Democratic non-Whites is nowhere near this figure. For example, [in a recent post-Iowa poll](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/109083/20160115/presidential-election-poll-2016-hillary-clinton-has-strong-lead-among-black-latino-voters-sanders-winning-white-vote.htm) his nationwide support registered at 20% among Blacks and 33% among Latinos - higher than the summer and fall of 2015, but nowhere near that 44% figure. By contrast, Obama ended up winning 82% of Blacks and 35% of Latinos.

So we might say, case closed, Bernie Sanders has an insurmountable Black People Problem.

#But what if there is unexpected good news for Sanders? Does the 2016 Democratic gym look different than 2008?

To understand how the Democratic electorate is possibly changing, let's compare [the exit polls for the first two states in 2008](http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf) to the [Iowa](http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/iowa/exit/) and [New Hampshire](http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/new-hampshire/exit/) exits in 2016.

- **SLIGHTLY LESS WHITE** Whites went from 93% of the vote in IA '08 to  91% in 2016. Similarly, NH dropped from 95% to 93% White. Projected across the nation, that's bad news for Sanders - he'd need to do even better among non-Whites to make up the difference.

- **NO TIDAL WAVE OF (WHITE) WOMEN** The New Hampshire primary went from 55% to 57% women, while Iowa held steady at 57% in both years. The lack of a ""women wave"" is pretty good news for Sanders considering he does about 10 points better among (White) men than women.

- **THE (WHITE) YOUTH AREN'T YUUUGE** Under-30s declined from 22% to 18% of the Iowa electorate and in New Hampshire they increased from 18% to 19%. Meanwhile, seniors increased from 22% to 28% in Iowa and 13% to 17% in New Hampshire. This is terrible news for the Revolution. Simply put, age might be the best predictor of affiliation among White voters. Seniors were the only cohort Clinton actually won in NH.

- **WHITES ARE MORE EDUCATED AND LEFTIST THAN EIGHT YEARS AGO.** Last time, 56% of NH voters identified themselves as Liberals. This time, IA and NH both identified as almost 70% Liberal. Income distributions & partisan ID stayed about the same, but college graduation rates also soared (grads went from 46% to 60% of the NH electorate).

Mostly, we're seeing small demographic changes compared to eight years ago. The big movers are Liberalness and educational attainment.

#The 2016 White Democrats are MUCH more educated and MUCH more Liberal than the White Democrats of 2008. Could that be bad news for Clinton?

An interesting pattern arises when we look at how Liberals and Moderates voted in 2008. When the state was diverse (e.g. Alabama, Texas, New Jersey) Obama and Clinton each had broad ideological coalitions: they each did about equally well among Liberals *and* among Moderates, with Hillary's vote perhaps being a little Moderate-heavy. But **the Whiter the state, the more Obama leaned on Liberals and Hillary's coalition tilted Moderate.** In Montana, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin and several other ""very White"" states, Obama outperformed Hillary among Liberals significantly whether he won or lost the state.

Simply put, White Liberals just didn't like Hillary in 2008. And that hasn't changed. The more Liberal the White part of the electorate has become, the worse that is for Hillary Clinton.

What about education? Clinton beat Obama 62-31 among White non-graduates, while only tying 48-47 among White graduates. That might make it seem like a flood of college grads is bad news for Clinton. But this year **that pattern has flipped.** Among White people, Bernie performs best with those who haven't graduated college. The more graduates, the better off Clinton will be, it seems.

So the increasing Liberalness of the White Democrats is bad news for Clinton, but their increasing educational attainment is good news for her - at least with Bernie as an opponent.

# What final conclusions can we draw? Iowa and New Hampshire have given us a glimpse of what White voters think about Sanders and Clinton, as well as how White voters have changed from 2008 to 2016.

1. There will be many more White Liberals this year than 2008. That's the best part of the news for Sanders. 

2. The bad news is young White voters aren't turning out as much as they did last time - and White seniors are turning out more. Sanders would much rather have it the other way around.

3. We also know that Sanders does better among Whites who haven't graduated college. But White voters are more educated now than in '08.

4. Finally, it may be too soon to tell but looks as though Whites will be *slightly* less of the Democratic electorate overall. Obviously, that increases the importance of doing well with non-Whites. 

Depending on how you weigh these four factors (**liberalness, age, education, and overall turnout**), Sanders could do worse or better than our ""gym estimates"" based on the characteristics of 2008's White voters.

We'll know more about White voters after the more politically moderate ones in South Carolina cast their ballots. We'll also start to know hard facts about how non White voters are deciding.

However, the basic math seems to remain pretty unchanged:

###Sanders needs to do significantly better with non-White voters than the polls currently estimate for him to have a chance of becoming the nominee.",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama

For example, whites born in 1941 came of age under Eisenhower, who was popular throughout his presidency. By the time Eisenhower left office in 1961, people born in the early 1940s had accumulated pro-Republican sentiment that would last their entire lifetimes. Conversely, people who came of age under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon tended to have more pro-Democratic views.

Applying this model, what can we expect of the generation coming of age in this political environment?

To put it into perspective, an American born in 2002 was six years old when Obama took office. The 2016 election cycle unfolded during or just prior to their freshman year of high school. Trump was president throughout their formative teen years, and they likely graduated high school remotely due to the Coronavirus. Their entire college or post-school experience has been marked by covid deaths and restrictions, high gas prices, inflation, and heavy partisanship met with political gridlock.

The Democrats do not seem to have changed in the same way. More leftist ideologies like socialism and communism are generally seen as fringe movements that have no influence.

The public debt held by the United States has surpassed $30 trillion for the first time, an increase of nearly 10 trillion in less than five years, in part because of government spending due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The total public debt was $30,012,386,059,238.29 on Tuesday, of which $6.5 trillion are intragovernmental holdings and $23.5 trillion is debt held by the public. This is up by 1 trillion in just 1.5 month and more than 2 trillion in just over a year.

The national debt nearly doubled during Barack Obama’s presidency but accelerated even faster under President Donald Trump, in part because of the Republican overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 2017 but also because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The budget deficit totaled $2.77 trillion in 2021, second to only the prior year, when a massive surge in government spending as a result of the pandemic pushed the deficit to $3.13 trillion. Deficits are expected to add another $12 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

**Bradley Manning**

Note: Apply ""allegedly"" to all of this. So if he actually did what everyone thinks he did.

Yes, I know, everyone is very happy about the whistle-blowing he did. But the guy did release tens of thousands of documents, including documents that had nothing related to whistle-blowing. Documents that included things like our diplomats bitching about other diplomats and world leaders, something that's not likely to help us build diplomatic ties now that they're out in the open.

More importantly, Manning released the [Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Foreign_Dependencies_Initiative), a list of all the places America is vulnerable to terrorist attack. Now available for anyone to see, including every last person on the Earth who'd want to do harm to America.

Even if you agree with Manning releasing all that other stuff, that doesn't excuse him from releasing stuff like this. Stuff that has no value as ""whistle-blowing"", but *can* be used by our enemies to hurt us.

And for everyone who says, ""well, it's not treason"", I've got news for you, because under our laws, it *is*. Amongst the charges levied against Manning is a charge under the Espionage Act. [One part in particular](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793) is damning:

>**Whoever, lawfully having** possession of, **access to**, control over, or being entrusted with **any document**, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note **relating to the national defense**, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, **willfully communicates**, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same **to any person not entitled to receive it**, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

This, Manning did without question if he truly did leak these documents.

But ""treason""? ""Treason"" is a strong word... What's the US Constitution have to say about that?

> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, **giving them Aid and Comfort**. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

Ah, yes. Well, I imagine revealing a list of prime targets qualifies as giving them aid and comfort.

If he leaked these documents, by our laws, Bradley Manning absolutely *did* commit treason.

For those concerned about the ""Right to a speedy trial"" thing, you might be interested to read [this](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/01/motion-to-dismiss-for-lack-of-speedy.html). It's a post made by David E. Coombs, Manning's lawyer, detailing RCM 707 and UCMJ Article 10, which deal with the right to a speedy trial and ""reasonable exclusions"". The long and short of it is, there are some cases when a court can grant extensions, *especially* when it's a trial of a military officer and *especially* especially when it's dealing with state secrets. And while there's certainly an argument to be made that the US government has abused its ability to request extensions, that's not yours, mine, Manning's, or even the prosecution's decision to make - it's the court's.

Also, regarding Manning's detainment, at least a part of the poor conditions he's been detained in are to some extent his own damn fault. He made a joke about committing suicide to one of his guards. Well, that's about as smart as making a joke to a TSA agent about a bomb, isn't it? [Here](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/03/truth-behind-quantico-brigs-decision-to.html) is Coombs' post regarding the subject.

Now, the reaction to this comment was extreme, no doubt. It allegedly didn't follow regulations, and Coombs was right to complain, and most likely also right that this *was* mistreatment of Manning... but to call it abuse is stretching things, I think. They have an extremely high-profile prisoner. Imagine how it would look if the guy joked about hanging himself with his underwear, his guards did nothing, and then the next morning he was found dead, hanged by his underwear. Now imagine the pile of shit that the guard who didn't respond to the comment would be in. According to various posts by Coombs, apparently the folks at Quantico were very apprehensive that something might happen to Manning while he was in their care. So apparently, they went overboard in their desire to make sure he was safe. This doesn't excuse it, of course, but those who seem to feel like he's being intentionally subjected to torture are maybe being a bit hasty in their judgment.

Incidentally, after he got transferred from Quantico to Fort Leavenworth, [here is a description of his typical day](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/05/typical-day-for-pfc-bradley-manning-at.html).

.

**Guantanamo**

First off, yeah, Guantanamo sucks and human rights violations suck. I'm totally with you there. For any on the *other* side of the political divide who've seen how expensive it is and think it's some sort of country club, I have news for you - it is on an island in the middle of semi-hostile waters. Everything needs to be shipped there, and because of this, *everything* is expensive there.

However, the big thing I often see here is how Obama hasn't closed Guantanamo. What a liar, right?

Well, except almost immediately after taking office, he signed an [executive order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities/) directing it to be closed.

Well, then why's it still open? Ugh, because shit, that's why.

When his people got to Guantanamo, what they discovered was that [the paperwork was a terrible mess](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/24/AR2009012401702_pf.html). Of course we now know that many detainees didn't even have paperwork. Anyway, Obama directed his people to get the paperwork in order so we could start actually prosecuting these people. You know, according to the law. And it was around that time that Republicans started making a stink about how terrorists shouldn't be tried in courts or housed in prisons on American soil, ""not in my backyard"" bullshit... and then Democrats lost the supermajority and Republicans have been using the filibuster like a blunt weapon ever since.

In 2010, Obama had to sign the military budget, like the President does every year. This bill includes the funds for everything the military does. Our wars overseas, all of our military installations, all the paychecks our soldiers get. It's a bill that *has* to get passed, especially during wartime. You can see it [**here**](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ383/html/PLAW-111publ383.htm). Republicans would not let it get by Congress without section 1034, which forbids the President from using any funds to move detainees from Guantanamo. In fact, they made it a part of their party platform's 2010 Congressional campaign promise list that they wouldn't let Guantanamo detainees be moved.

Obama, knowing how important the bill was, signed it, hoping he could work out a deal with Congress to do something about that section... because he kinda' needed the hundreds of other pages in that bill to get passed. 2012's military budget had the same section, and he once again signed the bill, knowing we couldn't just not have a military budget.

You might argue, he could have threatened not to sign it, I suppose. Republicans are, after all, very protective of their defense spending, and Democrats generally not so much. But Republicans would have continued to stonewall, and I'll bet you anything that the line they'd use would be ""Obama cares more about terrorists than he cares about our troops!"", and given the way the public sees things, his poll numbers would shoot down the tubes. Which, in itself, isn't horrible if it *accomplishes* something, but the Republicans would have milked it for every penny, all while refusing to give an inch. For them, it'd be two birds with one stone - prove to your voters that you're keeping your promise of not closing Guantanamo, and make Obama look like a terrorist-coddling, troop-hating Liberal.

That's the way things will continue to be, until either Republicans stop filibustering everything they don't like, or Democrats regain a supermajority in the Senate.

**""Insurance rates are rising since Obamacare went into effect!""**

I have spent a [considerable](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) amount of time reading through this bill, and I [continue](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/) to do so. I'll try not to be redundant by repeating the content of those here, but there is one bit of recent information I've come across, and it puts a damper on the claims that insurance premiums will rise because of the bill.

First off, last year, they *did* rise, and quite a bit. Something like 9%. Which seems like a lot, until you [look at the last decade](http://facts.kff.org/upload/jpg/enlarge/3%20Percentage%20Increase%20in%20Health%20Insurance%20Premiums%20Compared%20to%20Inflation1.jpg). For half of that decade, prices shot up just as much, if not more.

But that's not good news... that just means that nothing changed in 2011. But something *did* change in 2012. In 2012, our premiums only went up [4%](http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/11/pf/insurance/health-insurance-premiums/index.html), which is a *huge* accomplishment. Now, it's far too early to say if this is a trend, and given that most of the big changes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act puts into place don't happen until 2014, it's hard to say just what will happen to premiums then... but for now, the rise in insurance premiums is actually *slowing*.

.

So... yeah. just wanted to put that out there.

174,Is America a majority conservative or liberal country?,207.0,w7przo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/w7przo/is_america_a_majority_conservative_or_liberal/,628.0,1658757754.0,"America seems to be capable of swaying back and forth, but where does the majority of America lie? 

We’ve seen America vote for President Barack Obama twice, then swing wildly back and vote for President Trump. These are two very different individuals with vastly conflicting world views. But yet, America seems to have made both of these men leaders of it’s country.

175,Harry Enten wrote yesterday about how young voters are rejecting both Trump and Clinton at levels they didn't reject previous nominees. Why is this?

Enten writes that voters under 30 are averaging 41% and 20% for Clinton and Trump respectively. This is a pretty big change from how young voters felt in the past two cycles, where Obama pulled in over 60% of the under-30 vote.

Many young voters seem to be undecided, or supporting third party candidates. The support for Johnson and Stein among young voters far outstrips their support by the population as a whole.

1) What is causing young voters to reject the major party nominees?

2) Will this trend continue to election day, or will the third parties fade a bit, especially if they can't get into the debates?

3) Is this illustrative of a future trend? Will the major parties lose millenials in coming elections? Will the third parties be able to make more headway in the future as a result?",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama

177,What kind of reaction can we expect if Republicans maintain control of the House in November while clearly losing the popular vote?,207.0,92oemk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/92oemk/what_kind_of_reaction_can_we_expect_if/,720.0,1532803510.0,"Trump's 2016 victory was almost immediately tarnished by his significant loss in the nationwide popular vote, which supporters countered by arguing in favor of the electoral college system. Less noted is the similarly large discrepancy in the 2012 congressional elections, whose ""status quo"" result glossed over the fact that Republicans maintained a 33-seat advantage in the House despite losing the nationwide popular vote by 1.4 million. [This Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-gops-gerrymandered-advantages/2012/11/13/4785e4d6-2d2f-11e2-a99d-5c4203af7b7a_story.html) details the disconnect:

>Consider Pennsylvania, where President Obama won 52 percent of the votes cast, and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey defeated his Republican rival, 53 percent to 45 percent. Yet Democrats won just five of that state’s 18 U.S. House seats. [...]

>Obama won Ohio by two points, and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown won by five, but Democrats emerged with just four of Ohio’s 16 House seats.

>In Wisconsin, Obama prevailed by seven points, and Democratic Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin by five, but their party finished with just three of the state’s eight House seats.

>In Virginia, Obama and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine were clear victors, but Democrats won just three of the commonwealth’s 11 House seats. In Florida, Obama eked out a victory and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson won by 13 points, but Democrats will hold only 10 of the Sunshine State’s 27 House seats.

The unrepresentative result in the supposedly most representative branch was largely blamed on gerrymandering and ""packing"" of Democrats into urban districts, both factors that are still very much at play today -- to say nothing of post-[*Shelby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder) voter suppression laws and foreign meddling. For an even more recent example, just look to the [2017 Virginia House of Delegates elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates_election,_2017), where Democrats won by nearly 10 points statewide and yet fell a seat short of control after losing a coin toss in a tie-breaking race.

So, with so much Democratic hope riding on taking control of the House and finally holding the administration accountable, what kind of reaction can we expect if Democratic candidates collectively win millions more votes and yet still fall short of a majority by a dozen or more seats? How likely is such an outcome? Might we see widespread questioning of the legitimacy of a government with at least two branches held by popular vote losers? Would the lack of a mandate affect the Republicans' ability to pass legislation? Could we finally see movement on gerrymandering reform at any level? And would such an outcome further energize or completely demoralize Democrats headed into 2020?",PoliticalDiscussion,Obama

What effect will it have in terms of its popularity, Warren’s popularity, reactions of the other democrats etc",197.0,atzjyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/atzjyr/is_warrens_universal_child_care_plan_viable_what/,409.0,1550952764.0,"Warren's plan, assessed by Moody's economist Mark Zandi -- who's worked on both sides of the political aisle, including for John McCain and Barack Obama -- is based on these key points:

12 million kids in care -- It would greatly increase number of children receiving formal child care in the US from 6.8 million children under the age of 5 today to 12 million children -- about 60% of kids in that age range.
Public child care centers -- It would make use of the existing Head Start infrastructure to establish centers across the country, guaranteeing affordable, reliable options in ""child care deserts.""
A sliding scale for fees -- Care would be free for people making less than two times the poverty level, or about $50,000 for a family of four. Federal subsidies would insure no other family pays more than 7% of their income on childcare.
Not everyone would take part -- an estimated 30% of kids would still, by their parents' choice, be cared for by family, according to Zandi's analysis -- and it would be costly, with a price tag of $70 billion a year, or $700 billion over 10 years.

Warren's plan is audacious in part because it addresses the gap between proposals that have been floated for parental leave -- which concern newborns -- and universal pre-K, which centers on kids who are preschool aged. That leaves a hole for parents of anyone from about six months to 4 years old, which is a lot of working people.

The article mentions that child care workers would be paid similarly to teachers

Long-winded commentary.  Did he really expect normal people watching this to actually stay awake?  Did most people at home actually follow his long, rambling, discussions?

Where were the killing lines?  He mentioned Romney's lack of specific positions, but glossed them into random paragraphs on other topics.  He should have brought these out and hammered Romney with them.  What about Romney's time at Bain?  I can't believe that he didn't smack Romney down on jobs creation.

These are just random examples.  If we regard 'winning' the debate as 'most improving one's position in the campaign,' I'm picking Romney as the winner, simply because Obama didn't do a damn thing.

FFS, I was planning on using today's debate for class tomorrow.  Now I need to make a new lesson, because this is practically worthless.

EDIT: A number of people have rightly pointed out that a lesson can be made on how not to be boring, how not to miss opportunities, and just how not to debate in general.  This is fair enough, but good lessons are productive and engaging, and I know from experience that ""don't-do-this"" type lessons are just not as interesting and productive as ""do it like this"" type lessons.  We'll be talking about the debate in class for sure, but let's just say it didn't provide me with the material I'd hoped it would.

**Edit 2**: It's really funny how many people are still messaging me about how my political bias is somehow cheating my students.  You people should really learn that you can't make sweeping judgments about people based on very little knowledge.  The last Democrat whom I voted for president was Clinton.  President Clinton - not Secretary.  I am hardly a Democrat mouthpiece, and in my private life (i.e., not in class), I've been very critical of Obama's performance in office.  By my (too-high) standards, he has not been a good president.

I appreciate that so many of you know how to teach my class better than do I.  This is exactly what's wrong with America's educational system: all the best teachers just sit at home and complain about the paid teachers!  End sarcasm.  The point is that there is more to learn from watching a good example than a poor one.  Is there nothing to learn from this debate?  Of course not - *I was being hyperbolic when I called it ""worthless.""*

In Britain the backlash against conservatives led to the election of Jeremy Corbyn who is evidently marching the labour party towards irrelevance due to unconventional economic/foreign/etc policies that are way too fringe for the general electorate. While some top democrats have embraced Ellison, there have been signs from Obama aides that the west wing would disagree with his election as the chairman of DNC.

The gist of this is that the economic populism as offered by Sanders Democrats would be ineffective in countering Trump-style fearmongering, and even if elected grossly ineffective at treating the real economical problems.

So in essence, should the democrats stick to their guns and rationally market policies that have realistic chance of working when enacted, or embrace the left side of the party and challenge Trumpism with Economic populism?

>Democrats say their “pro-security” funding proposal would “ensure that the FBI has the emergency funding they need to track and stop domestic terrorists plotting to kill Americans” as well as bolster resources for more active shooter training for FBI officials.




>The Democrats' plan would add $190 million overall to the spending bill for the Justice Department, which also provides funding for the Commerce Department and science-related agencies. About $175 million will be directed toward the FBI’s counterterrorism efforts and $15 million for active shooter training. 
Senate Democrats argue that their new funding plan would better equip the FBI with critical resources as the agency investigates terror threats. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the FBI can restore more than 350 counterterrorism positions, including more than 225 special agents.




>Separately, Nelson unveiled legislation that would list any person who has been investigated for terrorist ties — even if the probe is no longer active — in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. If someone who has been investigated in the past tries to buy a firearm, the Nelson bill would require the NICS to automatically ping the FBI.


**From Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.):**

>It’s okay with me to stop a gun purchase, at least temporarily, if you’re on the terrorist watch list as long as the person has the right to challenge that. What I’m not going to do is let that be the issue. The issue is inadequate funding for the FBI and laws that don’t work. So let’s have a package. Let’s replace sequestration, take it off the table for the FBI. … Let’s have a robust, healthy debate about funding.

**From Bill Nelson (D-FL):**

>We’re not saying: don’t sell guns to someone just because they were investigated. But having a system in place that alerts the FBI if someone they once investigated is suddenly trying to purchase multiple assault weapons is just common sense.

What do you expect to happen with these proposals? What do you think of them? How would they affect the war on terror were they to pass?

**Edit:** Credit to /u/ReyWhelans for contributing the NRA's statement just made around 1 PM: 

>We are happy to meet with Donald Trump. The NRA's position on this issue has not changed. The NRA believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period. Anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing. If an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed. That has been the position of Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tex.) and a majority of the U.S. Senate. Sadly, President Obama and his allies would prefer to play politics with this issue.

189,"Reddit, can we have a serious discussion about what ""Fox News Geezer Syndrome"" has done to some of our parents?",181.0,1sdb3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1sdb3v/reddit_can_we_have_a_serious_discussion_about/,332.0,1386480792.0,"I feel like the severity of this issue has been largely understated, with the only possible exception being the original ""geezer syndrome"" article posted here: http://www.frumforum.com/fox-geezer-syndrome/

I know other people are experiencing what I am, and even if there's no solution to be had, I'd at least like to hear from other people with the same problem:

Over the past, say, 10 years, my parents, especially my dad, have become increasingly prone to fits of sudden and uncontrollable outrage at the slightest hint of something they deem to be ""liberal"". My dad is a smart person otherwise, but he will degrade into a yelling, table-pounding maniac at the slightest mention of topics like healthcare, gay marriage, Obama, immigration, or anything even remotely political. The increasing severity of his outbursts has been directly proportional to the amount of time he spends watching Fox News and listening to other extreme right-wing pundits, which is now to a point that could possibly be classified as an addiction.

Here's the funny thing: I don't consider myself to be excessively left-leaning, and I don't even fault Fox News for what they do. It's a free country, and they have a product that's serving a particular market. It's ridiculous that they're able to brand it as ""news"", but anyone is free to turn it off. The unfortunate thing is that there's a *huge* market for their brand of agenda-driven vitriol. My dad is their target demographic: typically older, typically white men who feel (for various reasons) compelled to find and attack very specific and identifiable scapegoats for even the most complex political, economic, and social problems. They want to make complicated problems very simple so they have something or someone to blame it all on.

I'm sort of amazed at how well Fox has been able to perfectly influence their audience to be exactly what they need them to be. They do a great job of ensuring that they (the audience) continue to be driven toward the content Fox is providing. I've personally identified the following things that they do extremely well:

* Instill a sense in their audience that the *only* way to be ""informed"" is through Fox News, or books by Fox News pundits. Other books, the Internet, journal articles, etc - they're all full of bleeding-heart liberal agendas or are the product of the left-wing educational machine. Anyone who suggests at any point that maybe there's an alternate viewpoint to be considered needs to be made to understand the ""truth"" [see point number 3 below]
* Following the last point, instill complete certainty that being educated is tantamount to being a left-wing radical. The more educated you are, the less you can be trusted. [sidenote: this one bothers me especially, because my dad has his own domain of expertise. He has a well-developed skillset in a particular discipline, so it baffles me that he doesn't recognize that yes, economists, scientists, sociologists, etc are probably better than you are at this stuff]
* Make it acceptable to have outbursts about politics no matter where you are, or who's around. Your family's trying to have a nice dinner? Not if someone mentions Obama in *any* capacity. It's time to ""inform"" them. Talking with the new neighbors and get a sense that they might be liberals? Better shut down that conversation hard, and make them know where you stand. And if they react unfavorably, it's because they're too stupid or brainwashed to accept the real truth. It's your job as a patriotic American to evangelize.

Ultimately, what sucks the most is that I feel like I've lost the ability to have any meaningful relationship with my dad. We can joke about movies or TV (as long as he doesn't find any of them to be too liberal), but beyond that I can't even discuss things like my career because ultimately any conversation about business will lead to him getting fired up about taxes, healthcare, or something in that realm. I'd like to find a way to bring him back from where he is now, but all my attempts thus far have been in vain.

**edit:** It also may be worth pointing out I'm not giving a pass to the more left-leaning ""news"" sources (e.g. MSNBC) here. They've also moved in the direction of attack-the-other-side-instead-of-providing-the-facts. Fox is just ahead of them because they got started earlier, and they have a wider audience, most of whom are entirely  entrenched in the agenda.

**tl;dr** My dad's devotion Fox News and other extreme right-wing content has made our relationship deteriorate significantly over the past decade or so, and it sucks.

Obama and Trump both recognized this, but they have chosen to combat it in very different ways: Obama chose to go the route of TPP, ie, forming a large trade alliance that sets standards on IP protections and labor laws etc to force China’s hands, but the major downside being the further export of manufacturing jobs to countries like Vietnam; Trump chose the path of trade tariffs, which targeted the current Chinese cycle of economic downturns and add pressure to its unemployment problems, but with major downsides being inflation on the consumer goods, and pressure on certain industries due to China’s retaliatory tariffs (agriculture is the one hit first, but there seems to be more to come)

The reason why they exist was to limit corruption since a  governmental branch or agency may have political connections to those it might be asked to investigate. Since this creates a conflict of interest the solution most often employed in the past is to have someone from outside the department lead the investigation. 

In light of the fact that Obama chose James Clapper, the head of the NSA to look into, well, himself and his agency, about issues/concerns concerning the constitutionality of archiving every electronic communication in the US and sharing it with other agencies for purposes other than terrorism. It would seem that the situation is perfect for a special prosecutor to be brought in and investigate these potential unconstitutional search and seizures of data other than that which was handed over by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Hotmail, Facebook, etc.

He/she can be fired at the President's pleasure.

The position is often a lightning rod for political conflict, and lends itself to conflict of interest. The AG is supposed to represent the American people, not the President. In cases where the President or the President's administration is violating the law, the AG's office is, in theory, supposed to investigate those potential violations. This sets up a conflict of interest as the AG is essentially investigating his/her boss.

The most recent example of this is Barr's summary of the Mueller report, in which Democrats complain that Barr downplayed aspects of the Mueller report. There are other examples as well though, including:

- Loretta Lynch (Obama presidency) was criticized by Republicans for her conversations with Bill Clinton/James Comey in relation to the Hillary Clinton email case
- Eric Holder (Obama presidency) was held in contempt of congress on a party line vote over a documents request
- Alberto Gonzales (Bush Jr. presidency) was criticized by Democrats for his poor memory when answering questions about torture authorization
- Famously, during the Watergate scanadal, President Nixon demanded the AG's office fire the special prosecutor investigating him.

All these cases involve a conflict of interest for the AG: on the one hand, to protect the political interests of the president (who can fire him/her), and on the other hand to follow/enforce the law.

Questions:

1. Should the current framework for the AG, in which the AG reports to the President, and can be fire by the President, be changed?
2. If yes, what reforms should be made?

I don't want to discuss this too much in relation to current events, but without becoming too biased I think I can say that Obama would have definitely made a third term work.
Isn't the event of a President's death in office a bit short-sighted to make a law out of the experience? After all, other working democracies such as the Federal Republic of Germany have no term limitation and never seemed to have big problems with it. Helmut Kohl was chancellor for 4*4 years (he ran for a fifth time and lost) and Angela Merkel is in her third term and announced a candidacy for a forth one, stating that „the decision was not easy”.
I am thinking, why let an artificial limitation interfere with the democratic decision of a population? So what if they wanted a third term for Obama.

NY19 is particularly interesting as its current composition puts it near the median seat needed to control the House (it will lean further left when new district boundaries take effect for the 2022 midterm). 

Why are Democrats doing better than history would predict? Do voters distinguish between Biden and downballot Democratic candidates? Has the Dobbs ruling caused a change (perhaps making thermostatic public opinion swing against the Supreme Court instead of President Biden)? Or did the January 6th Capitol riots impact independents? Or perhaps it is as much mundane as educational polarization leading to Democrats having more likely voters turn out for midterms.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

28,Megathread: Senate Intel Committee Releases Final Report Detailing Ties Between 2016 Trump Campaign and Russian Interference,60057.0,ic2tq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ic2tq0/megathread_senate_intel_committee_releases_final/,7432.0,1597763545.0,"A sprawling report released Tuesday by a Republican-controlled Senate panel that spent three years investigating Russia’s 2016 election interference laid out an extensive web of contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russian government officials and other Russians, including some with ties to the country’s intelligence services.

The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, totaling nearly 1,000 pages, provided a bipartisan Senate imprimatur for an extraordinary set of facts: The Russian government undertook an extensive campaign to try to sabotage the 2016 American election to help Mr. Trump become president, and some members of Mr. Trump’s circle of advisers were open to the help from an American adversary.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, on the constitutionality of pre-viability abortion bans. The Court ruled 6–3 that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and returning ""the authority to regulate abortion"" to the states.

Justice Alito delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice Roberts each filed concurring opinions, while Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented.

The ruling can be found here: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf

The Chief Justice wrote for the Court in _Trump v Vance_, affirming the Second Circuit and rejecting the Government's position that, under Article II and the Supremacy Clause, the President was entitled to absolute immunity and a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoenas. The case now goes back to the district court, where the Second Circuit permitted the Government to make alternative arguments. The vote was 5 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), 2 in concurrence with the decision (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).

The Chief Justice also wrote for the Court in _Trump vs Mazars_, vacating the lower court ruling affirming the Congressional subpoena and implementing a balancing test for the district court to consider in deciding whether to grant a Congressional subpoena, including:

(1) whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants subpoenaing the President and his papers (ie. whether there are other sources that Congress could obtain this information from);

(2) whether the scope of the subpoena is sufficiently narrow so that it is no broader than necessary to support Congress' legislative objective;

(3) what the nature is of evidence Congress is offered to establish that a subpoena is necessary to advance a valid legislative agenda; and

(4) what burden is imposed on the President, particularly since the subpoena originates from a rival branch of government that could use such subpoenas for institutional advantage. 

The vote was 7 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).

From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on ""Bloody Sunday,"" Lewis decisively carved a place for himself in the history books as a courageous young activist during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 

He was elected to Congress in 1986 and served 17 terms representing an Atlanta-area district.

In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose banks accounts.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

As of this date, March 3, 2022, Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, in much the same way as I have predicted here and elsewhere.  The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

I originally submitted on December 8, 2021, before Reddit Admins decided to [censor all Russian domains, in response to Putin's invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/t66l5f/reddit_blocked_all_domains_under_russian_cctld_ru/).  Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:

**********
**********

After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",geopolitics,Obama

I answered this question on Quora and it got a modestly significant number of views (about 50 upvotes). but it got removed by moderation, I don't know why. Probably because it upset some Chinese nationalists/pro-Chinese Quorans (Lin Xieyi comes to mind). As we all know, Reddit is a liberal Western echo chamber so I suppose my views will find some resonance here.

I posted it on Quora because I think it's important to debunk some of the ill-informed and simplistic opinions about Singapore's foreign policy toward China. There are too many of those kinds of people voicing those opinions there. And I think too many of our people are not sufficiently educated on our foreign policy positions. This has to change if we are to be immunized against influence operations.

**I am neither pro-China nor anti-China. I am pro-Singapore.**

# Do Singaporeans agree with the ex-diplomat that China is exercising influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore?

At first I didn’t, or was undecided, but now I do.

If you are a PRC patriot, or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations, please stop reading now. It’s for your own good.

Let’s examine the source in question. Who was this “ex-diplomat”?

· Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs

· He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.

· He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.

· Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)

· He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy

· There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence…by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers

· It is possible that the government prefers to use “unofficial” means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives

Now let’s examine the substance of his argument.

That China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.

But Bilahari Kausikan’s concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore’s sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one’s own benefit

Now let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)

But this is not a valid excuse. People who employ this excuse are essentially saying “So what? everyone does it”. To quote the Chinese Ambassador’s response *“I would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different.”* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.

American influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.

But **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable. The appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring.**

**SPECULATION ON CHINA’S 2016-2017 INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN**

In August, Huang Jing was exposed for giving *“supposedly ""privileged information"" to a senior member of the LKY School, so it could be passed on to the Singapore Government. The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy”.*

About 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with “very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy”), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China’s rise.

I think we can put two and two together.

I do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani. I think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to. I have no doubt that he earnestly, sincerely believes in the views that he propounds. I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book “Has China Won?”. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.

When Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan’s comment: *“This is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'”*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)

Kausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)

If you don’t have time, I’ll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):

*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position…*

*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing’s influence operations stems from China’s triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*

*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order… On this first track of state-to-state relations, there’s nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*

*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it’s also a Leninist state…and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP’s “magic weapon”… the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party’s interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*

*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation’s history and culture, now rejuvenated…and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office… In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China’s interests and work to advance China’s interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the 华人 (ethnic Chinese) and the 华侨 (overseas PRC citizens)…*

*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China’s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*

*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride…Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel…But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*

*\[the narrative of China’s absolute rise and America’s inevitable decline\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called “useful idiots”.*

***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental…many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government…Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore’s interests with China’s interest.***

***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016–2017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***

***It’s clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don’t know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***

*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*

This is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.

​

**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**

What is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.

In its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.

This is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us “See, this is what you are doing! Stop it!”. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that “no, actually we’re not doing that. We’re doing THIS”.

**MYTH 1. Surely as a “Chinese country”, Singapore should “explain” China’s position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**

**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**

**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**

**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it “taking sides” with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**

**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn’t know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**

Let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.

**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a “Chinese country”. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore’s identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being “race traitors” by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a “Chinese” identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.

Yes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to “empathize” with it.

But it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China’s claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China’s interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China’s interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.

**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China’s rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US’ intrinsic strengths and some of China’s structural challenges.

China is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.

But what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China’s rise (Mahbubani’s included) tend to take the Whig view of history - “up and up and on and on”

The Chinese never tire of reminding us that China’s presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America’s presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America’s presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.

Asia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.

**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China’s stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.

This is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.

This myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.

Singapore’s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity “soft” balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than “hard” balancing against China and “hard” bandwagoning with the US.

By the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don’t blame him, I think it’s a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.

So, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.

**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.

Now, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China’s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.

And in case you think our statement on the PCA’s verdict was somehow “extreme” or “new”, let me read out the statement to you:

>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  
*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  
*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  
*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*

In other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as “taking sides”? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?

Let me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?

Note also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?

Non-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a “hiding” strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.

​

[https://preview.redd.it/dl1v9eiudru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=674abcbdbdd903a8cc61d6b00f3ef61f0f2d92b0](https://preview.redd.it/dl1v9eiudru41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=674abcbdbdd903a8cc61d6b00f3ef61f0f2d92b0)

And while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore…and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?

*“I am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs…but when my security, Singapore’s survival, Singapore’s prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral”* \- Lee Kuan Yew

*“Singapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big ‘trees’ in the region”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *“now that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly…we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers”*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.

But has there been any fundamental change in Singapore’s policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.

The Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao’s China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a “running dog” of the West.

Lee Kuan Yew’s views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.

*“\[My uncle-in-law\] had this romantic idea that, you know, \[China\] is a land of my forefathers. I have no doubts that the land of my forefathers would have brought me down in the world…They (the Chinese) wanted me to contribute \[to my uncle-in-law’s manor house which the Chinese refurbished and made into a historic tourist site\]. I said no, no, I’m not Chinese, I’m Singaporean, I’m not going to visit the place…I have no romantic view about where I sprang from. I’m very grateful that my great grandmother who was born here decided she’s not going to go back (to China) with her husband because she doesn’t know China…I’m a lucky fellow. Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea…I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different. Their dress, their manners, their language. They are a different lot, that’s all. They come from a different society. Of course, at the end of the day they are Chinese.”* \-Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“That romantic idea of going back to the bosom of your motherland is a delusion. We have become different, that’s all. You can go back to China, you’re still different…If you go to China, I don’t think you will belong. They’ll say okay, we’ll accept you. But look at even the Malayan communist cadres who sent their families and children there…- nevertheless, they were treated differently…You think you’re Chinese , and that you will blend in, but you will not. You are already different. We are already different. Just like the American and the British people, or for that matter, the South African whites, Australians, New Zealanders and the British. The Taiwanese mainlanders and Chinese mainlanders, who have not stayed in Taiwan, yes, they are same stock, same heritage, but had different exposure, different standpoints, different views of the world. Are we Chinese? Yes, ethnically. Can we sit down with the Chinese and really feel part of them? Not possible. Because you speak Chinese? No. Your major premises are in your mind” - Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011*  
*“\[The Chinese\] expect us to be more respectful - you must respect me. They tell us countries big or small are equal, we’re not a hegemon, 不称霸. But when we do something they don’t like, they say you have made 1.3 billion people unhappy … So please know your place”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“I do not see Singapore surviving on the Chinese economy. If we spoke only Chinese, we would not be today’s Singapore. What is the difference if China is ten times stronger? It will make us ten times stronger? No. Our prosperity comes from linkages with the world…the future is the same. We are not Hainan Island. We are not Hong Kong, where they have no choice. We are in the centre of an archipelago of great diversity, with rich natural resources, and the world will come here”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“How can \[the Chinese object to the American logistics hub here\]? That is crude. If they ask us to stop the logistics base, our answer would be: you can use the logistics base and store your equipment here (so we would host both the Chinese and Americans”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into ‘conscribe’, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am Chinese. They are hypersensistive”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“You have to accept the fact that they (China) are the biggest boy in the neighbourhood. They will not be the biggest in the Pacific because the US will always be there to counterbalance them. But increasingly, they would be able to keep the US away from the coastal regions. That’s a development we have to accept. No more \[uncomfortable for Singapore\] than for the other countries…It’s even more tricky for Vietnam. We have no conflict of interest with China…we have no such overlapping claims with them.”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**CONCLUSION**

Let me emphasize again: I see the rise of China as a good thing in the long-term. It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China’s own behaviour.

But in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore’s own national interest - determined by Singaporeans’ own choices ALONE and no one else’s, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I’m only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.

Huang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy. When they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive space, we must continue to quietly, tactfully, but ruthlessly** ***slice those fingers off.***

2,"An escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, an overview",872.0,mjcr5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/mjcr5f/an_escalation_of_the_conflict_in_the_donbass_an/,59.0,1617470046.0,"*Escalation in the Donbas conflict is rising. Russia and Ukraine are building up their forces near the conflict zone. The question is, why? This analysis will try to go into some of the potential end game scenarios and explain why it is happening. The reader should not take this article for anything else than an analysis from a hobby enthusiast.*

**The show of force**

The most likely reason seen is Russia trying to muscle itself in front of Kyiv and Washington. Many experts say the recent Russian military movement does not comprise sufficient force for a conventional Ukraine invasion. With Russia's military posturing, it appears to be primarily coercive and demonstrative in nature as of now.

This argument is backed up by the fact that Russia's Western Military District has, per April 3, not mobilised key regiments and divisions that would likely be necessary to support an offensive against Ukraine. Moreover, Russia has also not built up the required logistical depots — including fuel, ammunition, and medical supplies — for a major offensive. Although there might infrastructure left from the many skirmishes and threats of escalation the last seven years, it is less likely western and Ukrainian intelligence would not have picked it up.

The third point is the lack of stealth and subtlety in the military build-up. If an offensive were the primary goal, the Russian military would not have openly telegraphed ongoing deployments, according to Mason Clark, lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. \*\* On Telegram, Twitter and other Social Media, there are many pictures and videos of the troop deployment that makes it easy to follow the movement.

The timing has also been an argument against an invasion. Right now Ukraine and Russia are at that time of the year called Rasputitsa. The time where travelling on unpaved roads or across the country is difficult and definitely be a disadvantage for an attacking force. 

**The Peacekeepers**

The second reason that might explain Russia's action if preparing for a military campaign is to get Russian ""peacekeepers"" in the Donbas region. Russia has denied and official military forces inside the area, blaming all Russian casualties or prisoners as voluntary soldiers without Moscow's orders. A triggering event, either natural or fake, can provide Russia with the Casus Belli to move into Donbas after an ""invitation"" of the local government in the pretence of protecting Russian citizens.

It would have the merit of preserving existing territorial arrangements, at least outwardly, yet it would allow for the revival of military operations at any moment required by Moscow. Moreover, it is the one military option that fits observable evidence: the movement of forces from Russia and local reserves' mobilisation.\*\*\*

**The (water) invasion**

The least likely option, but not impossible, is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, of all the analysts found, no one saw this as the main reason for the Russian forces' escalation in the region. Often the Crimea Water crisis is an argument as a reason for war.\*\*\*\*

A forced takeover action of the canal from the Russian military should be considered a last resort, given that the cost of such an operation for Russia would significantly exceed the possible benefit in almost any category.

To try would mean it would be necessary to capture more than 70 km of Ukrainian territory up to the left bank of the Kakhovka reservoir, which would meet strong resistance from a different Ukrainian military that was in 2014 and also entail new sanctions.

Simultaneously, the decommissioned canal has deteriorated in the last seven years, and without a significant overhaul, Russia would lose most of the water during transmission. The canal will also serve as a high-risk target for sabotage from the Ukrainian military, demanding many resources to protect it.

An invasion in this degree would be based on more goals or motivation than just water for Crimea.

*So what is the reason for this escalation?*

**Testing a new President**

When Trump took over the Presidency in 2017, there was a celebration in the Kremlin. However, the party soon ended as both sanctions, and the distance between Washington and Moscow continued. In some ways, the pressure on Russia increased. Trumps administration sent and approved the use of the Javelin missiles for frontline duty. A much welcome weapon to combat Russian tanks for the Ukrainian military, although not a gamechanger. \*\*\*\*\*\*

Biden presidency has early shown its support to Ukraine, and the recent escalation might be to see how far the new administration is willing to go. Putin might hope that Biden is a continuation of the Obama presidency, a man that Putin did not take seriously. However, the Russian President might be disappointed. Biden history in US politics goes back to the 70s, and he has experience both with Putin's Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union.

**Stopping a new Zelensky**

Something happened with the Ukrainian President in 2021. First, he stopped three pro-Russian tv channels from the air, and then sanctions hit the country's oligarchs, even the owner of the tv channel that made Zelensky famous, Ihor Kolomoyskyi. These events could be seen as a domestic issue, supported by the US to approve his falling approval ratings. Then the real bombshell hit. On February 19, Viktor Medvedchuk was put on the Ukrainian sanctions list due to the financing of terrorism.

Medvedchuk has been named Putin's man in Ukraine, and the Russian President is also the godfather of Medvedchuks, daughter. A man who has always been in the centre of Ukrainian politics and who always have promoted Russian interest. The sanctions made him powerless in the country. Zelensky could not have made such a move without guarantees from an ally more powerful than national oligarchs and Russia. The fact is that within two months, Ukraine has taken down a pro-Russia propaganda network that took years to build up. It must have been a surprise for both Medvedchuck and the Kremlin to see him being played out on the sidelines so quickly.

**The Nagorno ghost**

The war in Nagorno Karabakh might have ushered us into a new age of warfare, the age of drones. The conflict, where Armenia was supported by Russian arms and Azerbaijan by Turkish, was almost a walkover for the Azerbaijani forces. Turkish drones destroyed Russian bought tanks and armour.

Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones became overnight a weapon in demand, and one of the first buyers was Kyiv, who already have managed to put 6 of them in use. A joint venture between Ankara and Kyiv has also been made Russia's headache, which now must use more resources to research and incorporate drone warfare into its armed forces. The JV is seen as a win-win situation as Ukraine establish a new market and military capabilities, while Turkey might avoid western arms sanctions.§

However, it is to be noted that, like the Javelins, the drone programme is not a game-changer. Still, it puts another weapon in Ukraine's arsenal that again demands more resources to counter. In that sense, it is not surprising to see that the Russian is transporting the S-300 missile or other SAM system near Ukraine. This system might be permanently positioned in Donbas, as evidence suggests that drone use has been a severe problem to the separatists on the front line. In a simple sentence, after seven years, Ukraine has found an area of warfare where Russia lags.

All countries bordering Russia, except China, strategies a war with Russia on the following equation: How much damage can we inflict before Russia sees it as not worth it. The best window for Russia was in 2014.

Although Ukraine is still heavily shorthanded, especially the navy, no one can argue against the progress made. Russia will win if this is one to one conflict, but the costs will most likely be high; many believe it's too high.

3,Pakistans Two Front War,489.0,mf2wxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/mf2wxj/pakistans_two_front_war/,168.0,1616945078.0,"One thing that really stuck with me for the last few years was a warning from Obama to Trump when Obama left the White House. Obama warned Trump that the geopolitical situation he worried about the most was the border between India and Pakistan, that the situation there could spiral way out of control very quickly and the consequences would be devastating. If you factor in the nuclear weapons both sides here process it is pretty easy to see why the stakes are so high on this one, and how any escalation in this theatre may push Pakistan into a ""use them or lose them"" line of thinking in the event India were to push across the border. 

To take this further we put together a panel of experts to talk through this exact problem, and what it means for the region.

This week on the panel.

\- AYESHA JALAL (Tufts University)  
\- ADAM WEINSTEIN (Quincy Institute)  
\- ANDREW SMALL (German Marshall Fund)

As I see it Pakistan faces a two-front war, one against its historical rival India; and the other being internal factors that pull at the fabric of the Pakistani nation. Pakistan has many geographical advantages, but also many disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages is their reliance on the Indus river, as this river supplies the majority of the country's water and internal transportation. The river is the lifeblood of Pakistan, but it originates in the Kasmiri region of the Himalayas. Pakistan knows that if any more of Kasmir were to be occupied by the Indians it would put New Dehli in a position to build dams on the river tributaries and control the flow of water into Pakistan, a situation our expert from Tufts tells us would almost certainly push Pakistan into war with India. There is almost no way Pakistan could ever be comfortable with New Dehli having that much leverage over them at any point. 

The geography of a war between India and Pakistan is also terrifying as well for Islamabad, as once again the situation is stacked against them. Most of Pakistans major cities like Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore are less than a few 100km from the Indian frontlines, meaning if the Indians were to pull off a massive surprise attack (although that is very difficult in today's satellite age) the Indian army could be approaching the outskirts of these cities in a matter of days or hours. In the case of Islamabad, India's starting positions are only 86km from the outskirts of the city; meaning Pakistani leadership would have little time to formulate a response to the attack. This may force them to panic and turn to tactical nuclear weapons to slow the rapid Indian advance, but once the nuclear genie is out of the bottle is it very hard to put it back in. India may fear it is only the first wave and seek to use their nuclear arms to destroys as many of Pakistan's missiles as they can before they can be launched. All in all, a terrifying set of circumstances. 

As we so often find when we research these pieces colonial borders are often the source of internal problems, and I am not even going to get into the whole Kasmir situation. Pakistan has the Baloch people (split between Iran and Pakistan) seeking independence, and the Pashtun people (split between Afghanistan and Pakistan) both seeking independence. If the Baloch manage to pull away it would destroy much of the Chinese coastal investment that has been sunk into the country, and if the Pashtuns manage to pull away it would take a huge chunk of the Pakistani heartland with it. Pakistan tries to keep the lid on these two groups but other actors such as India seek to rile them up.  India for years has attempted to improve its relationships with Afghanistan hoping to turn them against Pakistan and form a two-front war, and on occasion they have pushed Kabul slightly in that direction. 

The real game at the moment though around Pakistan is between Beijing and Washington. Washington needs Pakistan for a logistical route into Afghanistan, as well as a potential jumping-off point for operations in Iran, Central Asia or Western China. Washington is also keenly aware that if Pakistan were to crumble it would likely become a much worse hotbed for terrorism than Afghanistan ever was, and if that were to spill over into domestic upheaval that may place nuclear arms in the hands of whoever takes control.

China though wants Pakistan for two completely different reasons. The first is as a way around any possible blockade of the South China Sea, hoping that Pakistan could accept the goods China needs into its Southern ports and then transport those goods up Pakistan and into Western China, but the trouble is that road they built to achieve this actually snakes into Indian territory for a few miles; and additionally due to it being high up in the mountains it would be even easier to cut off than the South China Sea would be. The second use China has for Pakistan is a wedge against India, knowing that tensions between Islamabad and New Dehli force India to concentrate its forces toward Pakistan, rather than China. 

I don't think it would happen any time soon but in the horrifying case of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan the likely overall winner of the situation would be China, with India having to suffer the devastation and China unscathed. 

I don't think nuclear war is ""likely"" between these two, but if I had to pick the area of the world it was most likely to occur in I would probably pick this one. 

Thanks again to this sub for all of your articles and recommendations, I would love to get your thoughts on the piece and the questions below? 

How likely do you think nuclear war is here? 

Would a trade corridor from Gwadar to Western China actually work in the event of a South China Sea Blockade? 

What would be the most like event to trigger off a war between these two, and how far into Pakistani territory do you think Indian tanks would have to get before Islamabad considered a nuclear response?

4,Russia's Pacific Strategy,442.0,ruegag,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ruegag/russias_pacific_strategy/,142.0,1641144390.0,"With the eyes of the world fixated on Russia’s border with Ukraine, Moscow is beginning to make major moves 7500km to the East on the Russian Pacific coast. Most major powers have already begun their pivot to Asia, and now Russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. Will Russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant China in this theatre? 

With its heartland west of the Ural Mountains, Russia has long been tightly Europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the Indo-Pacific, Moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. These regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the Soviet Era, and aside from hosting Russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in Vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in Moscow since much of Nuclear forces were redeployed to Kola.   
At present Vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the Kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. The Russian *Vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving Russia could rapidly deploy forces to the Pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of Kremlin planners. The exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. The Russian forces have been a predominately Western focused force, and that stokes fears that the Russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the Pacific front continues to gain importance.   

To try and combat this Putin set in motion his own Pivot to Asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the Russian far-east. Little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in Kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

This issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in Russian surface fleets. With 5 fleets to modernise, Russia’s Pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its Baltic, Northern, and even Black Sea fleets meaning that Vladivostok continues to receive the Russian navies leftovers.  Although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia’s hegemony in the region. 

With an ascendant China in the region though is Russia being delegated to a junior partner? We certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between Russian forces and the PLA and PLAN, and in those operations Russia has largely taken a backseat to China in regional issues, such as Korea. The caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still haven’t seen what would happen if China and Russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. The closeness of the Russia-China relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. For the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

The question I would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for Moscow to place the Pacific front on the same priority level as the Northern or Black Sea fronts, and how would Moscow react to a conflict in the South China sea?   
My gut feeling is that Russia would assist China with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in Europe? I am keen to get this subs thoughts though.

He is an attorney, political activist and blogger that gained notoriety through his [crusade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/net-impact) against Vladimir Putin.  Primarily through advocacy on YouTube, where his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NavalnyRu) as of this writing exceeds 6.4 million subscribers, Navalny highlights the Russian government’s corruption with particular emphasis on theft of state assets by Vladimir Putin and the circle of oligarchs that stand behind him. 

**Novichok & Context**

In August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in Germany following an assassination attempt with a [novichok nerve agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/world/europe/navalny-opcw-russia-novichok.html).  Novichok nerve agents are a type of binary chemical weapon.  Binary chemical weapons are stored and transported in the form of their less toxic chemical precursors, which makes them harder to identify and detect before use.  Novichok nerve agents belong to a class of chemical weapons developed by the USSR starting in the early 1970s.  While known to be currently manufactured by several other countries outside the current Russian federation, a similar novichok nerve agent was used for the purpose of assassinating Sergei and Yulia Skripal at their home in England in 2018.  

Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who acted as a double-agent for the United Kingdom’s intelligence services from the 1990s to 2000s.  Skripal was arrested outside his home in Moscow in December 2004, before being convicted of high treason against the Russian federation for his espionage activities in service of the British crown.  

Though sentenced to thirteen years in prison, he was exchanged for several Russian nationals who were imprisoned for life in the United Kingdom as a part of a spy swap in 2010.  While the Russian Federation had since abolished capital punishment, many [suspected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/sergei-skripal-does-revenge-for-treason-lie-behind-harm-to-ex-spy) that Skripal’s assassination was intended as a death sentence carried out from afar.  A similar fate befell the former FSB and KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a polonium isotope six years after he defected to the United Kingdom in the early 2000s with his wife and young son.  

And Vladimir Putin’s political rivals have not only died as a result of exposure to chemical weapons or radioactive isotopes.  For example, Boris Nemtsov was [gunned down](https://www.tvc.ru/news/show/id/62541) while jogging across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, in front of the Kremlin walls and near Red Square in February 2015, two days before he was supposed to attend a protest against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Few [seriously questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/world/europe/killing-of-boris-nemtsov-putin-critic-breeds-fear-in-russia.html) Putin’s involvement --- particularly in consideration of the fact that Ramzan Kadyrov’s former security chief almost certainly pulled the trigger.  A [show trial](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/3/russia-five-men-stand-trial-for-boris-nemtsov-murder) resulted in five Chechens being convicted for Nemstov’s assassination.  Beyond Nemtsov, at least Boris Berezovsky, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin all rank among assassinations behind which Putin and his government are the [common denominator](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-20170325-story.html).  

**Neither Death Nor Exile**

Before his return, one might have expected that Navalny would have availed himself of the opportunity to remain in [exile](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/06/508477662/political-exile-a-centuries-old-russian-tradition-returns), like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as opposed to the death he narrowly escaped before.  Navalny chose neither.  

After having recovered from poisoning by the novichok nerve agent, Navalny returned to Russia on January 17, 2021.  Navalny was arrested immediately upon return.  Navalny’s arrest was met with global outrage.  Navalny was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and faced a suspended sentence several years back --- despite the complete lack any credible evidence whatsoever to substantiate the charges.  He has been repeatedly arrested, served multiple prison sentences and he has been physically attacked by Putin’s “supporters” on multiple occasions.  In one such incident, a green dye commonly used as an antiseptic was [thrown in his face](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39735867) while in a [Siberian village](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-39337139).  Despite being subject to politically motivated fake criminal charges, assault and scores of other insults, Navalny has persevered.  

Two days later, on January 19, 2021, Navalny released a video titled [Putin’s Palace - History of the world’s largest bribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI), which has amassed more than 110,000,000 views since release.  The video alleges that a property valued at approximately $1.37 billion (US) located on the Black Sea was built for Putin’s benefit by the circle of oligarchs that form his inner circle.  Putin denies ownership.  [Yet, BBC coverage from 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17730959) quotes one of Putin’s business associates as having indicated that every last detail of the Bond-villain style palace was designed according to Putin’s precise specifications. 

Around the same time, Navalny released a [recorded phone conversation](https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-poisoning-underpants-202f470c2d1c19151b9deb564d94e8f9) in which he pretended to be an FSB officer, debriefing the FSB agent who poisoned him.  In the call, the poisoner apologetically states that the “situation would have turned out differently” if Navalny’s plane had not made the emergency landing that enabled Navalny to receive emergency medical treatment.  And of course, the situation might further have ended differently had Navalny not received medical care in Germany.  According to the call, the FSB agent placed the combined novichok agent inside Navalny’s underwear.  

Based on its OSINT investigation, Bellingcat [revealed the FSB team of chemical weapons experts behind Navalny’s poisoning](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/) who were likewise involved in a series of other [murders of Russian political activists](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/01/27/navalny-poison-squad-implicated-in-murders-of-three-russian-activists/).  The details of Bellingcat’s investigation are essentially confirmed by the phone call Navalny staged with the FSB operative who poisoned him --- though the FSB told the Associated Press that Navalny’s video was fake.

Following Navalny’s arrest, the largest protests in more than a decade erupted across Russia.  Tens of thousands took to the streets in sub-zero temperatures from Moscow to Yakutsk in which over 5,100 people [were arrested](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-moscow-coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-russia-085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c) in at least [109 cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/international-home/russia-protests-navalny.html) in each of Russia’s eleven time-zones.  Every single major city in Russia saw demonstrations in support of Navalny, prompting [unprecedented](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-moscow-60bb3ba4b68e80db4239e96c2d7ab060) repression tactics by Russian police. 

Rather than backing down in response, the pro-Navalny demonstrations have continued to gain [momendum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/across-russia-pro-navalny-demonstrations-continue-to-build-momentum) and show no sign of dissipating.  Masha Gessen [explained](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/alexey-navalnys-fearless-return-to-russia) that:

> [Navalny] has . . . show[n] people what they had always known about the Putin regime but had the option of pretending away.  He has shown the depth of the regime’s corruption.  He has shown that Putin’s secret police carries out murders.  With his return to Russia, he has shown the regime’s utter lack of imagination and inability to plan ahead.  He has also shown that, contrary to the Kremlin’s assertions and to conventional wisdom among Western Russia-watchers, there is an alternative to Putin. 

Now, there is no clear path forward where Putin isn’t the clear loser.  If Putin does manage to eventually kill Navalny, Russia may face international retaliation at least as severe as that imposed on Russia after Sergei Magnitsky’s murder.  On the other hand, if Putin does not manage to kill Navalny, Putin’s political rivals will continue to be emboldened, as Putin’s power-base ages and fragments.  While the point at which domestic and/or international political pressure rises to the level of an existential threat to Putin’s control remains unclear, Navalny has moved Russia in that direction.  Putin has never been weaker than he is now. 

**Geopolitics of Navalny’s Return**

The West is not without leverage against Russia, however limited the options may be.  Economic [sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-eu-idUSKBN2A924T), in particular, are a preferred means of coercion.  For example, in 2012 the Obama Administration signed the bipartisan Magnitsky Act into law, which imposed particularized economic sanctions against individuals implicated in Sergei Magnitsky’s murder in a Moscow prison.  Thereafter, numerous other countries passed similar legislation.  Magnitsky-style sanctions blacklisted named persons from Western banks and financial institutions and prohibited nearly all forms of commercial transaction with Western entities or individuals.  In addition, some states have denied visas, restricted travel and frozen and/or seized assets owned or controlled by individuals subject to such sanctions.  Russia maintains that these efforts violate Russian sovereignty and interfere with Russia’s judicial system.  

So far, the United States and Canada have condemned the Russian government’s actions in relation to Navalny and the protests supporting him.  And beyond Magnitsky-style sanctions, other punitive economic measures have been proposed.  

In Europe, two camps have emerged along familiar lines: (1) the United Kingdom, France, and Central and Eastern European countries like Poland, Romania and the Baltic states which historically take more [hawkish positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/18/alexei-navalny-us-europe-condemn-arrest-of-poisoned-putin-critic.html) toward Russia and Putin’s government; and (2) commercially entangled Western European countries like Germany and Italy, who seek to compartmentalize economic interests and human rights abuses.  

For example, [France](https://www.dw.com/en/france-presses-germany-to-ditch-nord-stream-2-over-navalny/a-56411291) has already urged Germany to scrap the gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, with Russia in response to Navalny’s assassination attempt and Russia’s anti-democratic political repression.  Yet, while Berlin has condemned the Kremlin and demanded Navalny’s release, Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman Martina Fietz has made clear that the German government has no intention of changing course with respect to future pipeline construction.  Likewise, Armin Laschet, who is the new leader of Merkel’s CDU party criticized any attempt to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool of political leverage against Putin’s government, [arguing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-laschet-exclusive/exclusive-navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-new-german-cdu-chief-says-idUSKBN2A51FL) that:

> For 50 years, even in the aggressive times of the Cold War, Germany has bought gas from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. The German government is following the right course.

German Economic Minister Peter Altmaier has likewise spoken out against linking Moscow’s political repression to Nord Stream 2, [stating](https://www.rferl.org/a/german-minister-warns-against-linking-fate-of-navalny-with-nord-stream-pipeline/31090454.html) that: 

> Business relationships and business projects that have existed for decades are one thing and serious human rights violations and our reactions to them are another.

Further, calls within the [United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55844146) to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who own or control interests in English football teams have been heard throughout Parliament.

But whether it is wise to punish Putin’s Russia for Navalny’s attempted assassination by sanctions or otherwise is another matter entirely.  Would imposing sanctions in response to the assassination attempt be nothing more than a symbolic gesture of condemnation?  Alternatively, would they be oriented towards *actually bringing about democratic reform* inside Russia and ending Putin’s regime?  Would the symbolic value of imposing sanctions at all be worth the risk that their imposition might wind up strengthening Putin’s hold on power?  And of course, would imposing sanctions make Navalny look like the Western puppet that many Putin supporters have alleged?  

The theoretical basis for when sanctions should work is straightforward:  impose costs greater than whatever benefit the target derives from continuing in the conduct for which he is being sanctioned.  And sanctions are typically effective at bringing about the specific harm they are oriented to cause.  The problem is that the harm sanctions create almost never translates to actual changes in policy consistent with the sanction’s intent and often bring about unintended consequences.  

Russia’s own punitive measures against Ukraine in the mid-2000s provide an illustrative example.  [Seitz & Zazzaro]( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2) found that when Russia punished Ukraine for democratic and pro-Western reform by raising gas prices, those affected “were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style political and economic systems” --- the exact opposite of what the Kremlin intended.  There is more to be said about why sanctions typically fail, but for our purposes it is enough to ask whether the foreseeable risks of backlash in response to Western sanctions outweigh any likely benefit.  

**The Future of Democracy in Russia**

Vadim Nikitin and others have [argued](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/putin-navalny-russia-protests/) that Navalny’s decision to return to Russia:

> … was an act of such singular courage that it seemed to send a jolt of electricity through the nation’s jaded conscience

It is by no means clear that Navalny will lead Russia to a democratic future.  Nor is it clear that Putin will not try --- and succeed --- to assassinate Navalny, again.  But this moment belongs to the Russian people, and the United States and Europe would do well to reflect on its significance.  For democracy to prevail in Russia, change must arise from within.  After all, these protests in support of Navalny mirror those that preceded [color revolutions across the Soviet bloc](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vladimir-putins-unchanging-unthinking-response-to-alexey-navalny).  Likewise, it is worth recalling that six months after Lenin’s [return from exile under similar circumstances](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/vladimir-lenin-return-journey-russia-changed-world-forever-180962127/) in Germany, he led the newly formed Soviet Union that emerged from Imperial Russia’s ashes. 

What is clear is that external pressure --- whether in the form of sanctions, cancelled business dealings or otherwise --- will reinforce Putin’s control of Russian politics and unite Russians against the West.  Several years ago, Navalny was the butt of Russian media late night jokes.  Then, even if many Russians themselves supported democratic reform, few saw Navalny as any kind of real transformative figure or alternative to Putin.  Now, they take to the streets by the tens of thousands in every major city in Russia across Russia’s eleven time zones to demand his release.",geopolitics,Obama
8,"A Framework for Understanding Russian Politics, for Westerners",250.0,86xe1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/86xe1f/a_framework_for_understanding_russian_politics/,83.0,1521938817.0,"I think that for a lot of Americans or Westerners and especially American academics who only read what other Americans say about Russia, there's a tendency to form unrealistic expectations as a result of being locked in an echo chamber. The purpose of this post is to offer a more realistic framework for understanding Russian politics.

The conventional American view is that there is a ""state actor"" that is ""Russia"" which acts to advance ""Russian interests"", as if it were just that simple. While I am simplifying here, the typical Western academic response is that Russians just want to maintain their status as a great power, while preventing further Western ""incursions"" into the so called Russian sphere of influence (usually inclusive of at least the former Soviet bloc). Many Western academics buy into the idea that American and/or NATO withdrawing from Central Europe will pacify ""Russia"", who only act in retaliation to ""western aggression"".

The problem with this view is both philosophical and practical, and it begins with a failure to appreciate the actual dynamics of Russian politics. It is critical to understand that there is no such thing as ""Russian"" interests as they would be ineligible to Westerners. When Western academics speak of ""American Interests"" they are referring to items of consideration that at least indirectly if not tangentially benefit ""Americans"".

For example, the United States has an ""interest"" in establishing a military presence in the South China Sea to ensure relative peace and stability in trade, to facilitate the importation of consumer products manufactured in China. Even though this ""interest"" is a few degrees removed from a direct benefit to the American people, there is at least a rational or logical connection between the US Military taking some action and a collective benefit to Americans. People may -- and certainly do -- disagree with this notion, but the rationale still exists.

In contrast, consider the Russian military onslaught into Eastern Ukraine. The reason Russia invaded Eastern Ukraine had nothing to do with any direct or indirect interest to the Russian people. The claimed reason was to ""protect ethnic Russians"", but the reality was that un-uniformed Speznaz troops invaded Eastern Ukraine (and forced a plebiscite at gunpoint in Crimea), in violation of international norms and international law. There was no threat of any kind by so called ""fascists"" in Ukraine, because the only internal rebellion was sponsored by the Russian government.

However, there was a very compelling reason why Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and why he caused a civil war to be fomented there. Putin's interest was in preventing Ukraine from establishing formal diplomatic and trade relations with the European Union, as the people of Ukraine wished to do. The reason Putin sought to prevent this was because this would be perceived by Russians as a sign of his own weakness, for having lost control of what Russians correctly understand to be little more than a puppet-state of Moscow. That perceived weakness would legitimize challenges to his authority, by legal means or otherwise and thereby pose a risk to his ability to stay in power. This is, to Putin, a direct threat to his remaining in power.

In addition, for Ukraine to have established formal diplomatic and economic relations with Western Europe would have had the second order effect of preventing Putin from realizing his ambition of creating an economic trading zone similar to NAFTA throughout Central and Eastern Europe for the purpose of reducing Russian vulnerability to Western economic sanctions. If that objective is to ever be realized, Ukraine must be a part of it and if Ukraine is economically integrating with the west, and Russia allows that to happen, Putin risks every other country in Central and Eastern Europe following suit. Creating such an economic zone insulates him politically from the fallout of the kinds of sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia now, hence his interest in it.

To define interests of the Russian government as ""Russian"" would imply that Russian leaders are in one sense or another acting to advance the collective goals of the country rather than their individual goals in amassing wealth and power. The only interests that matter in Russia, at this time, are the interests of Vladimir Putin and his political allies. Every other individual's or group's interests are irrelevant. So, whatever we regard as ""Russian"" interests must be limited in scope to be inclusive only of those interests of Putin and his political allies. Putin's interest is in remaining in power. The same interest is shared by his political allies, who benefit from his status and position. As such, the ""Russian Endgame"" in the present is doing whatever is required for the current regime to not be overthrown.

This view is supported by an objective review of Putin's ""accomplishments"" since he has begun to hold office. When Putin ran for ""president"" so many years ago, his by-line was that he was going to do something like 'make Russia great again'. In many respects, he was the political beneficiary of the economic conditions inside Russia during the Bush Administration's middle eastern adventurism which resulted in skyrocketing global oil prices. But, since Obama was elected oil prices steadily dropped and they have never returned to the rate they were between 2002-2008. This has caused Putin to have to reevaluate his political strategy, which he has now re-focused towards emphasis on so called ""Glory Days"" of the Soviet Union's military legacy in World War II (or, as it is known in Russia, the Great Patriotic War). It turns out that military mythology and nostalgia are all Putin is willing to offer the Russian people, for so long as they will accept that instead of the collective benefit that might have been had from the profits of Russian state-owned or managed industry. In this way, he pacifies Russian citizens in such a way as to prevent them from rebellion while in the same instance creating conditions for his political allies to steal from the state that money which should have gone to the Russian people.

While doubtlessly there is corruption of various kinds throughout every country, including the United States and Western Europe, liberal Western democracies exist fundamentally for the benefit of their citizens. This is not the case in Russia, the government of which exists for the sole and exclusive benefit of those who have the power to steal from it with impunity. Preserving this status quo is what drives all decision-making in the Kremlin. Western people should not labor under the delusion that ""Russian"" interests are anything more than Vladimir Putin's interests, which are materially congruent to the interests of his political allies.

tl;dr there are no relevant ""Russian"" interests that have any bearing on decisions Putin or anyone else in Russian government makes outside those limited interests that advance the specific goals of Putin and his political allies.",geopolitics,Obama
9,UAE and Israeli settlers find common ground in Jerusalem,235.0,jugacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/jugacy/uae_and_israeli_settlers_find_common_ground_in/,47.0,1605415744.0,"By James M. Dorsey

Weakened by Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of US President Donald J. Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu risks being caught between a rock and a hard place as Jordan, the Palestine Authority and the United Arab Emirates manoeuvre for control of what is to Jews the Temple Mount and to Muslims the Haram ash-Sharif, the third most holy site in Islam.

The rivalry for control of Jerusalem’s most sensitive, emotive, contested, and potentially explosive place is occurring against the backdrop of a parallel and interlinked run-up to a competition for the succession of Mahmoud Abbas, the frail 84-year old Palestinian president.

The Jerusalem site has been administered since Israel conquered East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war by the Jordanian and Palestinian-controlled Supreme Muslim Council.

Rivalry for the religious control of the site that hosts the Al Aqsa Mosque and is where the First Jewish Temple was built by King Solomon in 957 BC involves multiple risks for Mr. Netanyahu.

Mr. Netanyahu’s inclination to back attempts by the UAE with Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina, Islam’s holiest cities, in the background, to muscle their way into the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif could complicate relations with Jordan and widen differences with the Palestine Authority.

The UAE enhanced its ability to manoeuvre by establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and rushing to forge closer ties to the country’s political, security and economic elites.

In a twist of irony, the UAE finds common ground with the Israeli settler movement and the Jewish far-right in wanting to weaken Jordanian-Palestinian control of the Haram ash-Sharif and counter [Turkish efforts](https://mideastsoccer.blogspot.com/2020/07/on-front-lines-middle-eastern-rivals.html) to stoke Palestinian nationalist and religious sentiment. The settlers and the far-right are calling for internationalization of the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif, which plays into the UAE’s hands.

“Ironically, it may be the case that calls for just such an arrangement may come from Muslim citizens of countries that have normalized their ties with Israel and find it offensive that a small group of Palestinians are attempting to ban them from visiting one of their holiest sites,” said [Josiah Rotenberg](https://www.meforum.org/61766/internationalize-the-temple-mount?utm_source=Middle+East+Forum&utm_campaign=2f55a9a4ed-MEF_Rotenberg_2020_11_12_06_15&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_086cfd423c-2f55a9a4ed-33848825&goal=0_086cfd423c-2f55a9a4ed-33848825&mc_cid=2f55a9a4ed), a member of the Board of Governors of the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia-based right-wing think tank.

The UAE’s recognition of Israel and willingness to engage not only with businesses located in Israel’s pre-1967 borders but also those [headquartered in Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-settler-delegation-visit-dubai-to-talk-business-1.9303430?utm_source=smartfocus&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=daily-brief&utm_content=5035445) and invest in a [technology park in East Jerusalem](https://www.makorrishon.co.il/news/272697/) has fuelled a war of words with the Palestinians and sparked incidents with Emirati visitors to the Haram ash-Sharif.

""Most of the citizens of Israel, myself included, continue to... demand that Prime Minister Netanyahu apply full sovereignty to Judea and Samaria,"" said settlement leader [Yossi Dagan](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestine-advocates-decry-israeli-settlers-visit-uae) after heading a settlers’ delegation on a visit to Dubai to discuss business opportunities. Mr. Dagan was using the biblical name of the West Bank.

The visit reinforced Palestinian assertions that the creation of diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states prior to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would reinforce Israeli occupation rather than open the door to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The “Israeli-Emirati deal raises the concern and fear within the Jordanian Awqaf and among Palestinians, because it aims to give the UAE a new role inside al-Aqsa,” said former Palestinian minister of Jerusalem affairs [Khaled Abu Arafa](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-uae-exploiting-al-aqsa-market-israel-normalisation), referring to the Supreme Muslim Council.

[Muhammad Hussei](https://mideastsoccer.blogspot.com/2020/09/uae-recognition-of-israel-dents-emirati.html)n, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, didn’t need Mr. Dagan’s statement to come to that conclusion.

Resigning in protest from an Emirati clerical group established to project the UAE as a beacon of moderate Islam immediately after the announcement of UAE-Israel relations, Mr. Hussein banned Muslims from the Emirates from visiting and praying at Al-Aqsa Mosque.

An Emirati business delegation visiting Israel last month was verbally assaulted and told to go home by Palestinian worshippers when they went to pray at the mosque.

[Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shatiyyeh](https://www.timesofisrael.com/emirati-economic-delegation-quietly-visits-israel-is-accosted-on-temple-mount/) scolded the Emiratis, saying that “one ought to enter the gates of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque by way of its owners, rather than through the gates of the occupation.”

Responding on Twitter, [Laith al-Awadhi](https://twitter.com/lailaalawadhii/status/1318097416260812801), an Emirati national, retorted: “We will visit Al-Aqsa because it does not belong to you, it belongs to all Muslims.”

Saudi lawyer and writer [Abdel Rahman al-Lahim](https://twitter.com/allahim/status/1318636550436118528) chipped in arguing that ""it is very important for the Emiratis and Bahrainis to discuss with Israel ways of liberating Al-Aqsa Mosque from Palestinian thugs in order to protect visitors from Palestinian thuggery.""

Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, has slowed down a [reconciliation](https://www.timesofisrael.com/bidens-victory-prompts-great-expectations-in-ramallah-quite-possibly-too-great/) between his Fatah movement and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, in anticipation of a more empathetic policy by an incoming Biden administration.

Mr. Abbas broke off relations with the United States after Mr. Trump produced an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that endorsed annexation, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and cut off funding for the Palestinians.

Palestinian officials suspect the UAE, backed by Israel, of positioning [Mohammed Dahlan](https://newlinesmag.com/argument/the-talented-mr-dahlan/), an Abu Dhabi-based former Palestinian security chief with close ties to Emirati Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as US officials, as a potential successor to Mr. Abbas.

Mr. Abbas could be disappointed by the degree to which a Biden administration may reverse Mr. Trump’s policy and find that it may not oppose broadening the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif.

In an interview with [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/biden-aide-on-uae-f-35-sale-only-israel-was-meant-to-have-those-jets-in-region/), Anthony (Tony) Blinken, Mr. Biden’s top foreign policy advisor and a former senior official under President Barak Obama, signalled that Mr. Biden would, in contrast to Mr. Trump, oppose Israeli efforts to annex parts of the West Bank and could adopt a more critical attitude towards expansion of existing Israeli settlements.

It would likely be a position endorsed by the UAE despite the Emirates’ engagement with the settlers.

Mr. Blinken insisted that a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the “only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state and also to fulfil the Palestinian right to a state of their own.”

With both Israel and the Palestinians “far from a place where they’re ready to engage on negotiations or final status talks” Mr. Blinken said that a Biden administration would seek to ensure that “neither side takes additional unilateral steps that make the prospect of two states even more distant or closing it entirely.”

The Biden administration could well see broadening of the governance of Haram ash-Sharif as one way of achieving that goal.

* Olivia Gippner -- Hi, I am Olivia Gippner, Dahrendorf Postdoc Fellow on EU-East Asia relations. I spent the past five years researching EU-China climate relations, mutual perceptions and Chinese policy-making.  My major research interest is understanding how - or if at all - external actors, like the EU, can influence China and how they make sense of the domestic politics in China. The Paris COP21 is a fascinating process to study and teach in this regard. Besides climate policy and understanding how China is adjusting its place in the global system, my main research interests are EU foreign policy, peacekeeping and energy policy.

12,Attended a speech given by Michael McFaul last night. He had a lot of great info and an interesting hypothesis about Putin,222.0,a3r2bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a3r2bg/attended_a_speech_given_by_michael_mcfaul_last/,76.0,1544123065.0,"He felt confident saying the Yeltsin and Clinton had a great relationship, and people felt as if the fall of the Soviet Union could lead to a successor state that is friendly to the US, much like what happened after the fall of the Japanese Empire and the Nazi Reich. He admitted that he wasn’t actually dictating US policy towards Russia at the time, so he admits that this is an unprofessional opinion.

He says that during Medvedev’s administration, the US-Russia relations were the best they had been in 70 years. He pointed to the fact that, when polled, Russians had overall positive opinions of Americans, and Americans had positive opinions of Russia. Russia also helped immensely with getting Iran to negotiate on the Iran deal.

Putin was disgusted by Medvedev fostering warm relations with the US, which is why he took the presidency back and immediately burned all the bridges that Medvedev built with Obama. 

The impression throughout the speech that I got is that Putin has been the main deterrent stopping cooperation between the US and Russian regime. Someone asked him later that, if Putin is to blame for the breakdown in relations, if a post-Putin Russia would try to restore relations. His response was that Putin’s successor will likely follow this “Putinism” ideology that treats the West the same way the USSR did.",geopolitics,Obama

I would like to raise the topic again as I believe it is of relevance now that Biden is set to be President.

The Obama democrats were consistent in being anti-Russia both in words and action. And it is often argued they weren't as tough on China. The Trump administration on the other hand had less negative rhetoric about Russia, but their actions weren't too soft either. The current bipartisan consensus seems to acknowledge China as the key strategic long term threat to the US.

Putin and Xi are among the very few who haven't yet congratulated Biden. Shortly before the election, there was [a Kremlin press release accusing him of spreading hate about Russia](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-kremlin/kremlin-accuses-joe-biden-of-spreading-hatred-of-russia-with-threat-talk-idUSKBN27B13B),

I do not believe it is pragmatic for the US to have two key adversaries at the same time. Especially when one of them could be very useful in containing the other. Even more so, when said two adversaries could very well temporarily band together to make things very difficult for the US and its allies. US allies who are decision makers in the EU do not seem too keen on going too strong against Russia, besides grandstanding in public statements. They seem only slightly more inclined in going against China at the moment.

In taking on Russia, it is unlikely the US will have many allies other than Poland and the Baltics. In taking on China, it might have the support of most of China's neighbors - who, taken together, are both larger, richer and better armed than the Baltics + Poland.

It is possible that the US establishment itself has turned on China in recent months. Will Biden go against this? If he does, will he succeed? Now that the Dems are back in power, will the many Russia hawks left over from the old days get in the driver seat again? Lastly, were the Biden administration to go easy on China (vis-a-vis sanctions on tech companies, letting the Chinese have their way in their neighborhood, etc.), how does that affect the notion of China being a long term strategic threat to the US and Western values?

16,What's the endgame in Syria if collusion is true?,138.0,8clzll,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8clzll/whats_the_endgame_in_syria_if_collusion_is_true/,91.0,1523866510.0,"Not making any claims of veracity behind accusations of collusion between Putin and Trump. But let's assume for the purposes of this hypothetical scenario that all the claims are indeed true. What is the projected endgame of this posturing over Syria? What are the motives behind both the U.S. and Russia's actions, if they're both working together? 

Was the original missile strike on the first airbase merely a test to see if the U.S. could deliver on their claims of long-range precision targeting? Was it a legitimate display of force, or was there an ulterior motive? Was Trump warning Russia over Twitter an actual strategic leak of information, (by accident because Trump can't stop tweeting) or was it a deliberate warning that he can get away with because it matches his M.O. of demented ramblings, thus providing plausible deniability?

Bonus question: how is Trump tweeting our military plans to a nominally hostile country not considered treason? If I were a general planning an attack and the CiC blew it by literally telling the enemy, I'd be PISSED and file some charges for aiding and abetting... unless that was the plan all along. Can you imagine if Obama had tweeted that he was about to send troops to Pakistan to capture Bin Laden? 

Is this all just a charade? Assad got to gas some of his people at the cost of a few facilities. The U.S. gets to throw a costly  bone to its military industrial complex. Russia gets to reinforce its protector role in Syria without a loss of manpower - they get to look tough by ""standing up"" to the U.S. without actually suffering. This will certainly give them some influence in negotiating that pipeline we keep hearing about. This would mean more profits for Russian oil oligarchs, which under our hypotheses of collusion would translate into profits for Rosneft shareholders. If claims are true, this would benefit Trump's shell company with a 19% stake. The U.S. can keep dropping expensive military hardware on precision strikes to blow up some buildings that may or may not be chemical weapons factories and facilities. Given the landmark military budget this year, it's plausible to assume fiscal preparation for a profitable ""peacekeeping"" action that would lead to yet another contractor-benefiting war.

I find this very suspicious that this follows the pattern of the Iraq war. Why would a dictator knowingly use chemical weapons on their own people in risk of international retaliation, given the clear precedent of the U.S. invading on such a flimsy excuse? Why would a dictator use chemical weapons internally at all, given the availability of conventional military means (I.e. guns)? I'm struggling to think of a scenario where the strategic gain from a tactical chemical attack would outweigh the ire from the U.N. - unless the reason for using them would be to provoke such a response. 

Thanks for reading my wall of questions. This is the one of the few subs from which I could get an informed / critical response.

17,Analyzing America's recent Tomahawk strike on Syria,130.0,65a23x,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65a23x/analyzing_americas_recent_tomahawk_strike_on_syria/,48.0,1492137542.0,"Russia is claiming that ""only 23 out of 59"" Tomahawk's reached their destinations, while the U.S. military claims ""58 out of 59"" reached their intended destinations.

Russia provided no evidence of its claims. The highly-respected IHS Janes has [analyzed satellite imagery](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e59dSxYkcagJ:www.janes.com/article/69528/analysis-satellite-imagery-refutes-russian-claims-about-tomahawk-strike+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=safari) in the aftermath of the attack and concluded,  based upon damage assessment, that Moscow is lying about its claims.

A [highly-insightful article](https://jamestown.org/program/russian-air-defense-us-strike-al-shayrat/) sheds some more light on what Russian military specialists thought of the attack and summarizes their views:

> These systems are not principally designed to counter low-flying subsonic Tomahawks; their capacity to attempt this is limited to approximately 30–40 km. Colonel (retired) Mikhail Khodarenok, a defense correspondent for Gazeta.ru and an air defense specialist, notes **the Al-Shayrat airbase is located around 200 km from Latakia, which he suggests lies at the outer limit of the S-400 range: to strike a target at this range requires it to be flying at an altitude of 8–9 km. If it flies lower, the S-400’s multifunctional radar cannot see the cruise missile due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface. Similarly, the S-300V4 at Tartus has a range of around 100 km and requires a target altitude of 6–7 km. According to Air Force Colonel General (retired) Igor Maltsev, the former chief of the Main Staff in the Air Defense Troops, since Tomahawks fly at 50–60 meters above the ground, the outer effective range for the S-300V4 system would only be around 24–26 km in cross country terrain. Maltsev concluded that the S-400 and S-300V4 located in Latakia and Tartus did not have even a theoretical chance to counter the US cruise missile strike.** Moreover, to protect against a similar strike in the future, Maltsev believes Al-Shayrat would need four to five S-400 battalions, alongside a radar reconnaissance system to provide depth of detection against cruise missiles, in addition to an air regiment of Su-30SM or Su-35 fighters (Gazeta.ru, April 7).
> 
>...

> Noting the Russian defense ministry version, which places the attack between 03:42 (Moscow time) and 03:56, the author argues nearly 30 pairs of Tomahawks were fired almost simultaneously. The time interval from the lead pair to the final pair was about seven minutes, giving a total time interval of 14 minutes. **Fired from south of Crete, in the Mediterranean Sea, at a distance of 1,100 km from the Syrian coast, Russian air defense could not have detected the launches. Novichkov highlights the use of EW-18G Growler aircraft to provide electronic warfare (EW) cover for the attack, and suggests the cruise missiles could have crossed the Syrian coast close to Tartus, allowing some degree of tracking.** This would provide the Russian military with a real world lesson in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) in Syria, which can be applied elsewhere (Voyenno Promyshlennyy Kuryer, April 10).

This makes clear that it would have been very difficult for Russia to track the missiles, due to issues with distance, geography, and the use of electronic warfare by the U.S. to shield the signatures of the Tomahawks and confuse Russian radar.
 
The NYT provides the following account of the timeline associated with the decision making process of the White House:

[63 Hours: From Chemical Attack to Trump’s Strike in Syria
](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/syria-strike-trump-timeline.html)

In terms of strategy, it is quite clear that this was done for domestic consideration, something the Russians are fully aware of:

>“This strike is aimed at the U.S. domestic audience,” said Sergey Markov, a Moscow-based political analyst known for articulating views that are generally in line with Kremlin-approved orthodoxy, in an interview with VICE News. Trump, he added, “is failing to become a real president, they are blocking his policies, and he is trying to overcome the shortcomings of his presidency.”

and 

>“He’s not the not the first president to use war to deflect from a troubled domestic situation,” a scripted RT piece declared, flashing to a picture of former president Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the woman he had an affair with.

Interestingly, Russia is becoming used to the politicization of American foreign policy. Not just with Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats after Trump won, but also when the Obama administration did not veto a U.N.S.C resolution on Israel's settlements:


>“Lavrov warned against the impact of the U.S. domestic agenda on the Middle East Quartet and the UN Security Council,” the ministry stated. “He spotlighted harmful attempts to use these platforms for the Democrats’ and Republicans’ bickering.”

Lastly, I find Russia's claims about the Tomahawk's poor performance amusing, since they sound very similar to what the U.S. said about Russia's *own* cruise missile strikes back in October of 2015:

>[Four Russian cruise missiles fired at Syria from the Caspian Sea landed in Iran, unnamed US officials say.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34479873)

But what makes me laugh out loud at Gen Igor Konashenkov's lying is this statement he made in defence againts U.S. accusations that their cruise missiles landed in Iran:

>""Any professional knows that during these operations **we always fix the target before and after impact.** All our cruise missiles hit their target,"" said spokesman Gen Igor Konashenkov.



Huh, so if the targets are ""fixed"" why is he now claiming the Tomahawk's didn't land? Weren't they ""fixed"" as well and isn't he a ""professional"" too?

Lets first start with the obvious one:

Ukraine has a completely different military than they had in end of 2013. No question about it. Lets first take a look on pre-2014 crisis.

**Before 2014: In dissarray**

According to Foreign Research Policy in 2013 the Ukraine could fully support only one battalion of 10.000 soldier in a military operation. When the annextion of Crimea happened the Ukraine was helpless in any situation. Although it is to be mentioned that they were extremely close to stop the insurgency in Donbass, until Russia started sending soldiers in. However this was done by mostly volunteer battalions.

Since then Ukraine has adopted itself into a new fighting force. New doctrines was written and new reforms was implemented. From going to a unequipped, non-trained force of 160k, they now boost a 250k strong army with almost full support to conduct military operations. Furthermore the dreaded conscription is being phased out with a professional army,

Increased funding has helped Ukraine significantly boost both the volume and combat-readiness of its troops. Since 2013, the number of military personnel has risen 36% to 250,000.

This is particularly notable as the Ukrainian army gradually abandons its unpopular draft and moves to a contract service model. According to official plans (it was approved in 2017), by 2020, up to 80% of servicemen will be professional soldiers.

Furthermore the doctrines is now integrated to NATOs, meaning that western powers provide training and equipment for the Ukrainan forces.

**Reorganization in good way**

The Ukraine military has created units for information and psychological special operations/propaganda/counter information units and has reformed its territorial defense system. Today, in each region of the state, formed units of territorial defense are based on reservists, volunteers, and demobilized soldiers.

By the end of this year, these units will be reorganized into battalions and consolidated into brigades, which will be managed by the command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of the Ukraine. The next stage will be the training of brigades in accordance with the standards of the NATO.

This will make it much more easier for NATO to provide Ukraine with support in potential conflict. It also has streamlined assets and manpower, making the chain of command much more efficient.

**The rise of the special forces:**

Before 2014 the Special Forces of Ukraine was seen as brutes, more likely to break up protest than doing high risk missions for the defence of the country. Like many post-war states they had the Spetnaz structure where different groups was loyal to different bureaus. After Maidan 2014 many of them was disbanded and several of them shifted side. The most infamous of them was the group Berkut, who was disbanded right afterwards, with many of the members escaping to Crimea.

After 2014 the special forces operated in seperatist areas.  During the fighting in and around Donetsk Airport in 2015, Kremlin-supported forces dubbed the Ukrainian defenders, which included members of the 3rd Spetnaz Regiment, as inhuman “cyborgs” for their tenacity. They only abandoned their positions after repeated artillery bombardments and assaults with tanks and other armored vehicles.

In 2016 the Special Forces commander went to Germany where he meet with U.S leader of Special Forces. Although spare with details, US has provided the special forces with equipment and training. U.S instructors has been training them, and new non-lethal equipment like modern uniforms and drones has been sent to Ukraines special forces.

However, both Obama and Trump administration has been hesitant to send more lethal equipment to Ukraine as it might move the balance of power, escalating the situations. However the Trump administration have approved sales of Javelin missiles and is less likely to be restrictive of U.S weapon support. 

**The gamechanger**

Russia is planning on building their ground forces around the Armata Universal Combat Plattform. A next generation plattform of Tanks and armored vechile where there are few countermeasures against. The system is already in place in a limited scope of the Russian military forces, but would be used for a campaign.  T

he Active Protection system that is installed in the plattform, which can reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank guided weapons and RPGs by two-thirds, making it almost indestructable. (Some analyst speculate that the ratio of ellimination with other tanks can be as high as 10/1)

Since 1916, the biggest threat to tanks has been, not other tanks, but ambush by hidden anti-tank weapons — from repurposed field guns in World War I to specialized *panzerjäger* vehicles in World War II to shoulder-fired rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles today.

If Ukraines Anti-tank squads will not be able to stop Russian tanks, they have already lost the war. Thats why its of vital importance for Ukraine to have access to a countermeasure. The most relable one yet is the FGM-148 Javelin which Ukraine bought around 200 of in early 2018. If Ukraine can stop and disable a large number of Russian tanks it can be the breaking point of the war. (Not to mention that the Armata plattform is extremely expensive, with speculation on how many Russia actually can financially support)

While we are in the topic of tanks...

**Updated armor:**

The biggest problem that former Sovjet states had after the breakup was the huge arsenal of tanks left. Many of the countries used the leftover tanks as a backbone for the new national armies, but as time passed and they broke down without being replaced. From 2014 there has been a replacement of armor and cars to provide assets for the next 10-20 years. Although not enough to combat Russia head on there, there is enough tanks and APV operational for military operations of a larger scale. However, Ukraine meet some setback here. The Humwee delivered from US provided not up for the task of Ukrainian terrain, creating the need for resources to modify those. The second problem is that Ukraine has little money to develop and create more tanks for a full on defense.

**Logistics:**

In 2014 the biggest problem was that Ukraine had nothing, now it can be said that they have too little. Before the logistics line was dependended on voluntary contribution from society. F.ex food, warm clothes was needed to be donated from private persons. Now the soldiers has a more streamlined logistics line. Food is delivered in standard MR and uniforms for all weather has been bought in. Here is a example of clothes bought in in 2017 alone:

*kevlar helmets – 18.000 items; 	body armour vests – 1.000 sets; 	Service uniform – 20.000 sets; 	field hats – 173.200 items; 	helmet liners – 150.000 items; 	summer field uniform – 308.000 sets; 	cold-weather field jackets – 146.600 items; 	cold-weather field trousers – 87.600 items; 	combat boots – 327.200 pairs; 	short-sleeved vests – 180.000 items; 	knit cold-weather undergarments – 210.300 sets; 	knit undershirt – 304.500 sets.*

Gas trucks and mobile kitchens has also been bought and a Ukrainian field corps has been given a field hospital and training by germans for medical support. 17 trucks with the capacity to perform electronic warfare was bought in along with 20 state of the art combat performing ambulances.

**Training:**

Ukraine has performed 238 training activites in 2017, with more than 300 i 2018, combined with live combat experience in Donbass has made the Ukrainian military more combat ready and better equipped. Salaries has been increased and the morale is seen to be on higher level than in 2013. Although not yet gone, the dependency on volunteer batalions has dimmished the last years.  The Armed Forces of Ukraine turned around a disastrous situation in the 2014 conflict thanks to the help of volunteer fighters. But even after an active process of absorption, their full integration into the regular army remains maybe the biggest challenge. Conclusion: Its far away from the anarchy of 2014, but there are still challenges ahead to create a NATO standard streamlined command.

**Future needs:**

Although the Ukraine is better off supporting the ground troops, there is still a large demands in the air-segment and in the navy. Ukraine have only one corvette and one fregate to protect their shores, which is impossible against Russia presence in Crimea. Plans to build 4 fregattes and buy  Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate from US is in the works but will not be active for many years.

In the land department Ukraine has requested to buy US [Patriot](http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23351/ukraine-requests-to-buy-patriot-missiles-as-it-delivers-a-mobile-radar-to-the-u-s-army) systems to combat a superior russian air force.  As with the Armata tanks, the most efficient counter measure against russian Iskander missile system comes from the US. A defence against Iskander that is stationed in Crimea will be a large setback of Russian military plans that heavily is supported by the system.

**Conclusion:**

Ukraine has not wasted the time after 2014 but some will question that they could be more efficient. Corruption is still a mayor problem and the country is outpowered on air and sea. Although we most likely would seen Russian success in a land combat also, the price would be more heavy than 4 years ago as casualties would be high. The highest risk is now lack of money and sabotage within.

The AMA thread is locked so there isnt any chance for discussion in that thread. I'm just going to give a very rough shortened summary of questions and answers to give people a chance to re-read them and discuss them. I categorized them into sections for ease of reading. 

---

**IR Theory**

---

Q) You have claimed that your theory can explain roughly around 75% of the events in international relations. No theory can explain everything, so my question is if you think that a theory of foreign policy or a decision-making theory complements your theory in a meaningful way?

A) I cannot prove it, but my intuition is that our best theories can explain roughly 75% of the events which are applicable to that theory. The reason why the explanatory power of any social science theory is limited is that the world is exceedingly complex, and what theories effectively try to do is simplify that complicated reality by focusing on just a handful of key factors that are thought to be important for making sense of that complex world. In the process of developing any theory, a number of other factors get left on the cutting room floor. They are thought to be of secondary or tertiary importance for understanding the world. But occasionally (25% in my story) one of those factors matters a lot, and when that happens, the theory cannot explain the case.

---


Q) I am familiar with the multitude of realist sub-theories (Offensive, Defensive, Structural, etc..) Do you feel that since there can be no real explanation without a sound theory that realist IR scholars should focus first on trying to resolve differences within the realist realm or that there is a benefit to allowing the many sub-theories to compete with the sub-theories of other large theoretical traditions (liberalism, constructivism, institutionalism, etc..)

A) I think the differences you mention are not resolvable at a purely theoretical level. The key at that level is to make sure that the realist theories are specified as clearly and comprehensively as possible so that they can be tested against each other to see which theory has the most explanatory power. What happens in the real world ultimately determines which realist theory is the best, but that is not the same as resolving differences.

---


**Nuclear proliferation**


---

Q) Do you believe there is high likelihood of non-state actors obtaining offensive nuclear capability in our lifetime?

A) I think it is extremely unlikely that a non-state actor will acquire nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. Virtually every state in the international system has a deep-seated interest in making sure that does not happen.

---

**Donald Trump**

---

Q) Is Donald Trump a realist?

A) I think Trump is a loose cannon who knows remarkably little about international politics.

---

**North Korea/China/USA conflict**


---

Q) From your perspective, what lessons can we take from the U.S. experience in Iraq when applied to dealing with North Korea?

A) The one clear lesson we can take from Iraq is: don't invade NK for the purpose of doing regime change. But that is highly unlikely anyway, because NK has nuclear weapons. If Iraq had nuclear weapons in 2003, Saddam would almost certainly still be in power!

---

Q: It would seem to me that any agreement that could be achieved between the US and North Korea that would be predicated on a reduced US military presence in the region would be a significant gain Beijing and Moscow.


A) The US simply cannot reduce its presence in Northeast Asia, because they are needed there to contain China [...] But let's assume I am wrong and that the US is willing to pull most of its forces out of South Korea and the surrounding area. Would that work to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons? I think the answer is no, because NK's greatest fear is regime change, which the US is addicted to, and the US can always strike NK from afar (and maybe in conjunction with SK's formidable conventional forces) after NK has abandoned its nuclear weapons. As long as NK has nuclear weapons the US will not attack it for purposes of regime change. So, why would they give those weapons up? It would be a remarkably foolish move on their part. They know what happened to Gaddafi after he gave up his WMD programs on the promise the US and its allies would not threaten his survival. He's now six feet under the ground!

---


Q) In a recent PBS News Hour interview, you argued that China has ""remarkably little leverage"" over North Korea. Could you elaborate a bit further on this, given that China essentially controls 90% of North Korea's economy?


A) China cannot afford to let NK collapse, because it is a strategically important buffer between SK, where there are substantial American military forces, and China. If NK were to collapse, there is the grave danger (from China's perspective) that Korea would be unified by SK, which would bring the Americans right up to China's border. That outcome is simply unacceptable to Beijing. Again, China needs an independent NK. China, for example, cannot go along with tough UN sanctions aimed at bringing NK to its knees, as the US would like. NK leaders know that, which allows them to thumb their noses at China

---

Q) You've stated in earlier interviews that most strategies to contain North Korea would fail and that it is virtually impossible to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. What do you think the United States should do concerning North Korea?

A) I don't believe I have said that most strategies to contain NK are likely to fail. I have argued that the various strategies designed to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons are almost certain to fail, as NK has powerful incentives to keep those weapons. Nevertheless, I think it is feasible to contain NK, mainly because there is no plausible way it can employ its nuclear weapons for advantage. And if it were to use them, it would probably be turned into a smoking, radiating ruin.

---

Q) Was NK's nuclear program was a waste of their time and resources. Who wins with a nuclear NK?

A) On the contrary; NK was smart to build a nuclear arsenal, as nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent. You do not see the United States moving to get rid of its nuclear weapons, despite the fact it has the most powerful conventional forces in the world, weak neighbors to the north and south, and two giant moats to its east and west. Why? Because American policymakers want nuclear weapons for deterrent purposes just in case they run into serious trouble down the road. Given how weak NK is relative to its neighbors, it has even greater incentives to possess nuclear weapons. Of course, it is not in America's interest for NK to have a nuclear deterrent, but that is a different matter.

---


Q) In case of the fall of the North Korean regime and unification of the peninsula, would US military presence be removed from the region or they'll be kept in the new country as a counterbalance to China? Wouldn't that upset China because they are encircled by the US?

A) I do not think there will be reunification of the two Koreas, because it would almost certainly be done under the auspices of SK, which is joined at the hip with the US. That would mean the American military would be able to move up to the Yalu River. That possibility is what brought China into the Korean War in the fall of 1950. Beijing had no intention of letting MacArthur's forces reach the Yalu River. Nothing is changed in that regard. Thus for Korean unification to happen, the US would have to completely sever its military alliance with SK and allow the newly unified Korea to be either neutral or pro-Chinese. SK would also have to be willing to go down that road. I do not see either SK or the US agreeing to that outcome.

---

Q) What do you think of the potential nuclearization of both the Republic of Korea and the State of Japan in the aftermath of this crisis if it does not escalate? What consequences might such a thing have? Furthermore, where you sitting in the Oval Office how would you handle the crisis in the context of the increasingly coercive regime in Beijing?

A) The US will go to great lengths to prevent Japan and SK from acquiring nuclear weapons. The main reason is that the US does not want a close ally having its finger on a nuclear trigger in a crisis. The great fear is that the ally in question might use its nuclear weapons if it feels its survival is at risk, which would almost certainly drag the United States into a nuclear war. The ideal situation for the United States is to control all the nuclear weapons within its alliance structure, so as to minimize the chances of unwanted nuclear escalation. Japan and SK, however, have to be thinking about getting their own nuclear weapons these days for three good reasons: 1) they are surrounded by threatening states that have their own nuclear weapons (China and NK); 2) the US might not use its nuclear weapons to defend Japan or SK if their survival is threatened, because of fear that the United States would get hit with nuclear weapons by the adversary; 3) the Trump administration looks unreliable, as it does not seem deeply committed to protecting its allies and even hints about sending the troops home. It is hard to say for sure how this is going to play out over time, but there is likely to be at least much more talk in Japan and SK about acquiring their own nuclear deterrent.

---


Q) Is NK a rational power and acquiring nuclear weapons for deterrence, or do you believe that the Kim Regime is irrational and must be stopped?

A) I think the Kim regime is rational, which is why I think a nuclear NK can be deterred. To the extent I worry about any country behaving irrationally over the NK situation, it is the US. I believe that view is widely shared in East Asia and even here in the United States.

---


Q) Do you think any method of politics or negotiation can denuclearize North Korea? Also, do you think South Korea would ever use it's ""Decapitation Squad"", on the Kim regime?

A) I don't think it is possible at this juncture to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons. SK's decision to set up a ""Decapitation Squad"" makes it even more likely that NK will never give up its nuclear weapons. The basic principle one should keep in mind here is that the more you threaten NK, the greater its incentives to hang on to its nuclear weapons.

---

**China/US conflict**

---

Q) I know you have said that China cannot rise peacefully, but how do you think US-China economic interdependence factors into the likelihood of conflict between them?

A) Many people I engage with over the question of whether China can rise peacefully believe that economic interdependence between China and the US, as well as China and its neighbors, is the key to China's peaceful rise. I do not think economic interdependence is a sound basis for peace. Remember that China has made it clear that it would go to war if Taiwan declared its independence, knowing full well that it would pay a stiff economic price. This case and many others tell me that when push comes to shove, politics trumps economics, especially when security matters are on the table.


---

**Central Asian region/Russia/Ukraine**

---

Q) How important do you think the Central Asian region is going to be in terms of overall Asian politics and the tug of war between regional powers like China, India, Russia, etc? And how do you see relations between Russia and China develop in near future as they're both competing for the favor of many of the countries in that region?

A) I think that Sino-Russian relations are good today, mainly because the US and its West European allies drove Russia into the arms of China in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. China and Russia are not natural allies, and Central Asia is a region where there is potential for conflict between Beijing and Moscow. The Russians are very worried about China's ""one belt, one road"" initiative, in part because it calls for projecting Chinese power into Central Asia, which is a strategically important region to Moscow. There is little doubt that China and India are likely to be adversaries in the future, as the recent territorial dispute between them in the area near Bhutan makes clear.

---

Q) What West European allies could have done differently in Ukraine crisis?

A) Not tried to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border. Specifically, the West should have refrained from trying to integrate Ukraine into the EU, and especially into NATO. The West, and especially the United States, failed to realize that Ukraine is of vital strategic importance to Russia, and that there is no way it would allow Ukraine to become a member of a hostile military alliance.

---


Q) Hello, thanks for taking your time to be here. I was wondering your take on Russian arctic expansion, and whether or not you think it will have an important role in the geo-politics of this century.


A) Russia is already a powerful presence in the Arctic, but so far there has been little competition and much cooperation between Russia and the other countries that are important players in that region. The US has been busy elsewhere so it has not been deeply involved in the Arctic. That situation could change, in which case competition between Moscow and Washington in the Arctic would start up. I might also say that I find it hard to see what salient issue the countries engaged in the region might fight over. All of this is to say that my sense is that there is not likely to be big trouble in the Arctic anytime soon.

---

**Israel-Palestine conflict**

---

Q) What is your view on how the influence of the Israel lobby on US foreign policy has changed under the Obama and Trump administrations and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general?

A) I think that the influence of the lobby has hardly changed since Obama first took office. It remains a remarkably powerful interest group. What has changed is that now lots of people understand that there is an Israel lobby and that it wields great influence on US foreign policy. Regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, it seems clear to me that the two-state solution is dead and that there is going to be a Greater Israel for the foreseeable future. I agree with former Israeli prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, who have said that in the absence of a two-state solution, Greater Israel would be an apartheid state.


---

**Saudi-Iran-Qatari conflict**

---

Q) The recent blockade of most of the GCC states on Qatar has left the tiny state cornered from its traditional allies (and cousins). How do Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, etc. benefit from the continued alienation of one of their richer neighbors, especially considering that Qatar has not folded to their demands, and seem unlikely to in the near future?

A)  I do not know how Saudi Arabia and its allies benefit from picking a major-league fight with Qatar, a move that drives Qatar toward closer relations with Iran. It seems like a strategically foolish move, as does Riyadh's decision to go to war in Yemen, which has turned into a giant mess for the Saudis. And, of course, Saudi Arabia is on the losing end in Syria. All of this tells you that there is something deeply wrong with Saudi foreign policy.

---

Q) Would you say that you see Saudi Arabia remaining a regional power in the next 60 years?

A) It's impossible to say what the future holds for SA. It does look like the foundations of that society are beginning to form cracks, but I am not sure where it all leads. I might also note that SA is not an especially powerful regional actor from a military point of view. Iran, Israel and Turkey are both much more powerful militarily.

---

Q) Is Saudi Arabia facing Shia/Iranian encirclement or establishing a Shia crescent that presents a threat to the Gulf Monarchies, the wider Sunni world, Israel, the US, etc?

A) Iran is not a threat to the Gulf monarchies, contrary to what most people in those countries think. First, Iran, which has never invaded a country in its history, shows no inclination to want to invade Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies. Second, and more importantly, the United States would intervene immediately if Iran invaded one of the Gulf monarchies and the Iranians know that. American leaders have made it manifestly clear that they will not tolerate Iran becoming a regional hegemony in the Persian Gulf.

---

**Afghanistan**

---

Q) What's the best way forward with regards to Afghanistan?

A) The best strategy is to leave and let those stakeholders you mention deal with Afghanistan. There is nothing the US can do to fix the problem. This is simply the least bad strategy. Obama did not pull all of the US forces out of Afghanistan by January 2009 and Trump recently decided to hang on in Afghanistan, because neither one of them wants to be accused of ""losing"" Afghanistan. Both surely recognize that there is no clever strategy for rescuing the situation in Afghanistan.

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

>The membership of CyberBerkut is anonymous, but reportedly includes former officers in the Crimean Berkut. That unit was part of Ukraine's Interior Ministry until Crimea's March 2014 annexation, upon which the Crimean Berkut was incorporated into Russia's Interior Ministry. CyberBerkut's ""Ukrainian identity"" is vigorously asserted, however, as it postures as an internal opposition group. 

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

Here's a good article to read: [The pro-Russian Disinformation Campaign
in the Czech Republic and Slovakia](http://www.irsec-hub.org/download/docs/412_is-pro-russian-campaign.pdf)

I see from reddit.com/r/The_Donald that you people already hate Soros (links often lead to Russian disinformation websites) and think NATO should turn into a protection racket, ignoring basic hegemonic theory and forward deployment strategy of the U.S. near Russia and China. 

As an example, take a look at this conspiracy theory (and irrational) self post from /r/The_Donald: 

>[Is it just me or does it seem kind of funny that whenever there's emails leaked of people in the Clintons circle a shooting or riot comes up to distract people right after the leaks happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4xnree/major_leak_hurts_clinton_campaign_blm_riots/)

And look at one of the more popular comments:

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

For now, read some of this history regarding Soviet Active Measures (relevant to our current situation):

27,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,95.0,5bgwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/,15.0,1478453724.0,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>---

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>---

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

He frequently re-tweets WikiLeaks, just like DCLeaks. He re-tweets and follows conspiracy theory outlets like Alex Jones and Roger Stone, just like DCLeaks followed RT and PressTV. Of course, he sprang back to life two days ago, right before Election Day, to complain about ""Democrats rigging the election."" I thought he didn't favour any political party?

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? “Do you feel in charge?” Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?

>TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight. But first questions.

>Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing “Free Press” is not being “Free as in free beer” or “Free as in free of government influence?

>Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

29,An imminent flashpoint in the Indo-Pacific: Senkaku/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai Islands,89.0,ru6sy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ru6sy9/an_imminent_flashpoint_in_the_indopacific/,18.0,1641118360.0,"The 50-year-old controversy between Japan, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan over the sovereignty of a group of tiny, uninhabited islets and rocks in the East China Sea, administered by Japan and referred to as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, as the Diaoyu Islands in the PRC and as the Diaoyutai Islands in Taiwan has become a proxy battlefield in the growing Sino-US great power competition in the Indo-Pacific, against the backdrop of a widening Sino-Japanese power gap.

**The geographical location of the disputed island**

The contested islets and rocks are located at about 170 km northwest of Japan's Ishigaki Island/Okinawa Prefecture, at approximately 170 km northeast of Taiwan, and roughly 330 km off the coast of mainland China. They have a total area of 6.3 km^(2) and consist of five volcanic islets and three barren rocky outcrops. Their geological characteristics are distinct from those located in the South China Sea. The biggest islet, Uotsuri Island, is the only 'island', sustaining a Japanese population engaged in economic activity until the 1930s.

**Republic Of China's claim over Diaoyutai**

According to the ROC, China discovered the Diaoyutai Islands in 1372 during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and since then, the Chinese people have been closely linked to them. The areas surrounding the islands had been repeatedly referred to as part of Chinese history since 1534. Chinese envoys at the time used the islands as a navigation post en route to the Ryūkyū Kingdom (now Okinawa). Furthermore, According to ROC Foreign Minister David Lin, “The most authoritative historical records supporting the Chinese claim are envoy mission records and official Taiwan gazetteers published during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912).”

Due to its diplomatic isolation, Taipei's voice is often ignored, even though it is a claimant state in both the East and South China Seas. However, ROC claims that the islands form an inherent territory of Taiwan based on the islands geographical location, geological structure, historical evidence, usage, and international law.However, in recent years, Taipei was able to score some gains by using a two-pronged strategy.

On the “soft” side, President Ma Ying-jeou in August 2012 proposed an East China Sea Peace Initiative (ECSPI) calling on all parties to,

* Restrain from taking any antagonistic actions,
* Shelve controversies and not abandon dialogue, (3) observe international law and resolve disputes through peaceful means,
* Seek consensus on a code of conduct in the East China Sea, and
* Establish a mechanism for cooperation on exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea

Implementation guidelines soon followed, Calling for a two-stage implementation:

* Peaceful dialogue and mutually reciprocal negotiation and
* Sharing resources and cooperative development. 

On the ""hard"" side, soon after Japan’s nationalization announcement, Taipei blessed some activists seeking to land on those disputed islands and at one point even dispatched its Coast Guard ships to shoot water cannons at Japanese patrol ships. Taiwan’s assertive behaviour caught many observers by surprise and raised the spectre of a tacit collaboration between Taiwan and China, despite the ROC’s repeated denial.

Perhaps to head off possible China-Taiwan collusion and with US nudging, Japan signed a fishery agreement with Taiwan in April 2013— the first concession over the island quarrel after seventeen futile previous rounds of negotiation. Taiwanese boats can now operate freely in a 7,400-square-kilometer area around these islands.

**Conflicting sovereignty claims to the disputed islands**

While PRC/ROC share the narrative which is built on historic evidence substantiating its claim of having first discovered the islands in 1372 under the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and of the islands have been an 'inherent part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

The narrative defended by Japan, which currently has administrative control over the islands, is based on the acquisition of ownership through discovery and occupation. Japan has consistently denied that there is a sovereignty dispute in the first place. According to Japan's official position, Tatsushiro Koga, a Japanese businessman, explored the islands in 1884 and leased four of them from 1896 after Japan had carried out on-site field surveys, in line with procedures set out in international law.

Japan incorporated the island into Okinawa Prefecture in 1895, during the Sino-Japanese War a few months prior to the Treaty of Shimonoseki by China and Japan in April 1985. Under this treaty, China ceded to Japan 'the island of Formosa (Taiwan), together with all islands appertaining or belonging to the said island of Formosa, as well as the Penghu Islands. The eight islets and rocks are not mentioned. The PRC, however, asserts that they were among the territory ceded to Japan, while Japan claims that they were already Japanese territory.

The PRC and Taiwan have argued that the islands should have been returned to China under the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, following Japan's unconditional surrender after World War II. Under the Potsdam Declaration 'Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine'. The Japanese position, however, states that Article 3 of the 1951 San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan provides 'that the Nansei Shoto Islands be placed under the administrative authority of the US'. It also states that at that time, the Senkaku Islands were included in the Nansei Shoto Islands and thus remained as part of Japanese territory.

**Gradual militarisation of the sovereignty dispute**

Prior to 2010, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands were a relatively peripheral issue in Sino-Japanese relations.

* **September 7, 2010**A Chinese fishing trawler collided with Japanese Coast Guard ships in the waters surrounding the islands, resulting in the Japanese detention of the ship and crew and the arrest of the captain. This spiralled into a major diplomatic incident, as Beijing applied increasing pressure on Japan for their return. Japan first released the ship and crew, and then eventually also the captain, after which tensions subsided.
* **2012, Nationalization of the disputed Island**The Japanese government chose to preempt an initiative by the nationalist mayor of Tokyo to buy several of the islands from a private owner by purchasing the islands themselves. This unleashed a new round of conflict involving popular protests and official tensions. The 2010 collision and subsequent 2012 purchase were thus decisive turning points in the nature of the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. 

Since late 2010 the islands have increased in significance as a symbol, as a domestic political football, and as an object of ongoing, competitive jockeying. The islands became increasingly salient as a domestic political issue in no small part because of their growing symbolic significance. But at the same time, the symbolic import of the islands benefitted immensely from being championed by domestic politicians, activists, and others who latched onto the issue, whether opportunistically or out of sincere conviction. As the islands’ symbolic and domestic political importance rose, so too did the respective pressures on the leaders managing the contest to take stronger action. This set in motion competitive spirals of move and counter-move between Tokyo and Beijing.

**The PRC's strategy of eroding Japan's administrative control**

Japan's 2020 defence white paper states that the PRC has 'relentlessly continued attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in the sea area around the Senkaku Islands. Since Japan's acquisition of three of the disputed islands from a private Japanese landowner in September 2012, the PRC has adopted a more offensive strategy, involving the deployment of 'grey-zone operations' aimed at gradually and incrementally challenging Japan's administrative control over the contested islands and generating 'proof' of the PRC's administrative control by means of sub-threshold coercion, without triggering an armed conflict. These operations are mainly performed by the China Cost Guard (CCG) and the maritime militia, with the PLAN remaining in the background to make operations look like pure civil law enforcement activities.

In September 2012 the CCG abruptly changed its operational pattern by significantly stepping up the number of its vessels present not only in the contiguous zone of 24 nm but also in the territorial sea of 12 nm around the contested islands. The increased presence of CCG vessels since 2012 did not come as a short flare-up as was the case in the wake of the 2010 trawler incident. Rather the increasingly frequent and longer presence of the CCG in the maritime zones around the disputed islands has become a constant feature of what researchers have referred to as the first phase in a three-phased strategy of coercive grey-zone operations. The second phase of the strategy, i.e. overlapping administrative control, would be the PRC's exercise of law enforcement rights in these maritime zones in parallel to Japan.

**US Position**

Since 1972, the US has held a neutral position on the sovereignty of the disputed islands. However, in the 1990s the US started to confirm that they are covered by Article 5 of the US-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security as Japanese-administered territory. In 2014, former President Barack Obama made an oral US defence commitment in favour of the disputed islands in the event of their attack. In 2017, former President Donald Trump reaffirmed this US commitment in ajoint written declaration with then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Following this, the US Air Force and the Japan Air Self-Defence Force (JASDF) held joint training flights near the disputed islands.

While the Obama administration had a mostly relaxed policy with China, since Trump, there have been multiple moves to restrict business with China. The Chinese economy has slowed down, its relations with western countries worsened, and its global image tarnished with the massive rise of anti-China sentiment since then. Many manufacturers are also looking out of China. China’s eventually surpassing of the US economy seems to have delayed by at least another decade.

I mean, was the geopolitical combat between, say, the Ottoman and Persian Empires ever this intense?

The Saudis and their Gulf allies are willing to back (or at least tolerate substantive backing from their citizens) Sunni Salafist extremists that are (or will be) almost certain to later turn their violent intentions towards Gulf monarchies, all because they are effective fighters against Iranian proxies (Assad and his minions).  Iran is willing to provide shelter and support to Sunni extremists (al-Qaeda, the Taliban) in order to do battle with Saudi partners.  Both sides reflexively point their fingers at the other whenever there is violence from religious minorities in their lands (see Saudi blaming of Iran for Shi'a riots last year, Iran blaming Saudi Arabia for the ISIS attack this week).  Saudi Arabia has further demonstrated its willingness to do battle with Iran with its latest round of measures against Qatar this week.

Indeed, it seems that President Obama's grand plan to stabilize the Middle East and wean the region off of American military involvement was ruined because Iran and Saudi Arabia/its GCC allies couldn't keep their hands off of each others' throats.

The objectives to force Russia to change its behaviour by isolating it diplomatically and economically has failed. In the years since not only has Russia manage to defy  expectations about its economy but its ability to project power and influence around the world in various ways, including the US. At the same time Russia has a permanent need for foreign capital and technology, and the sanctions hamper that.

We are now in new phase I will term ""Diplomatic Bargaining"", in which both sides try to convince the other to accept all their conditions which will be very good for them but if they dont accept it will be fine for themselves and very bad for the other.

The interests of both countries is simple; Russia wants control and influence in Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine, and sees it as existential, while the US wants to prevent a hegemon in Eastern Europe, or just Europe in general. These are competitive interests, and will likely never be reconciled.

The world order seems to be shifting closer to that of a multipolar world, with the US having the ability to project power onto every part of the globe but at the same time having limits on that power. Other major powers around the world are finding it to be in their interest to expand their contacts and hedge bets. It is very likely that the US will continue upsetting the global trade order it set up to subsidise its allies during the Cold War. In this context the US and Russia will no longer have an exclusive relationship like in the Cold War, but have to seriously take into account other players as they seek to maximise their national interests.

Some questions to consider in this thread

1. Will the US and Russia compromise and agree on a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe?
2. How will each countries' domestic audience hamper their diplomats' ability to make agreements?
3. What other countries matter in the US-Russia relations and what are their interests?",geopolitics,Obama
33,North Korea is considered to be a top global risk by foreign policy experts going into 2017. Are the dangers being overblown?,76.0,5iirrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5iirrt/north_korea_is_considered_to_be_a_top_global_risk/,32.0,1481822639.0,"I know North Korea has been talked to death around here, but as we head into 2017, I'm eager to know why it's considered a such top-tier global threat. 

According to the Council on Foreign Relations’ [2017 Preventive Priorities Survey](http://www.cfr.org/conflict-assessment/preventive-priorities-survey-2017/p38562?cid=nlc-news_release-news_release-preventive_priorities_survey), North Korea ranked at the top of global flashpoints in 2017 along with a Russia-NATO confrontation and a terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland. We know from a variety of press accounts that North Korea was at the top of the list of threats on which President-elect Trump received briefings from President Obama himself.

The CFR survey asked foreign policy experts to rank conflicts based on both their likelihood of occurring or escalating and their potential impact on US national interests. According to the survey the DPRK ranked in the top tier, with a potentially high impact and moderate likelihood of “nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) weapons testing, a military provocation, or internal political instability.

Are foreign policy experts merely saber rattling North Korea because Iran isn't as much of a nuclear threat as before and we need another boogeyman, or do they actually suspect North Korea will further escalate their provocations once they manage to get nuclear ballistic missiles? It seems like what the Kims have accomplished so far in regards to nuclear testing has been for regime survival and not for offensive strategy. 

By most recent accounts there seems to be a lot of activity in Pyongyang, and a lot of it being commercially related. Sanctions aren’t working. China has been lax on enforcing them up until recently with the coal but, you know, the North has 50 years of experience in evading sanctions anyway so I don't think it really matters. And after SK President Park’s impeachment,  North Korea seems to have plenty to gain from a Minjoo party candidate, whose platform calls for greater engagement with the North, winning the presidency. 

So I'm really curious as to your thoughts as to why it is (or why it shouldn't be) such a critical global threat that's comparable to something like a NATO-Russia confrontation in 2017.

34,Random thoughts about diverging social/political perspectives in China and abroad,73.0,7xkqsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7xkqsa/random_thoughts_about_diverging_socialpolitical/,84.0,1518637724.0,"I have wanted to talk about this topic for a while (some discussions on this sub got me into thinking about it), but my intention to really write this post was triggered by one article so I'll start by writing something like a submission statement for it:

>[Marco Rubio’s Nobel Nod Hurts Hong Kong Freedom Fighters](https://www.thedailybeast.com/marco-rubios-nobel-nod-hurts-hong-kong-freedom-fighters)

Republican lawmakers have nominated three important figures in the 2014 Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The article argues that such a move will hurt their cause, due to both the Chinese government's typical response to attribute dissent to foreign influence, and the ongoing alienation of the movement itself due to a few poorly received public stunts.

As Chinese myself I personally agree with the article's conclusion. While western politicians and maybe the general population may perceive the Nobel Peace Prize as a great honor, Chinese people generally think the exact opposite. Liu Xiaobo was best known as a supporter of colonialism who deserved everything the government threw at him. Aung San Suu Kyi is now an ""in your face"" backfired issue towards the Baizuo (Chinese internet slang equivalent to SJW). Obama got the prize before doing anything and eventually didn't really contribute that much to peace. As for Dalai Lama, just think of the worst terms possible in your language and that's how most Chinese people genuinely see him as. I imagine lots of Chinese people (who can be bothered) expect and prefer these three to get the prize, so that the view of the Nobel Peace Prize as a western political statement is supported even further and the HK pro-democracy movements becomes associated with yet another dishonor, exactly like the article stated.

BTW the science Nobels are generally reputable. The disdain is reserved mostly for the Peace Prize and sometimes for Literature.

At least based on my limited exposure to some opinions and sentiments often expressed in online discussions (which may very well suffer from the vocal minority effect), attitude towards the Nobel Peace Prize is merely one aspect of the increasing divergence in political stances and values between Chinese and mainstream Western social and political discussion. The divergence is not merely about being ""different"" or ""agree to differ"" but ""fundamentally opposite"". If Zhihu (basically Chinese Quora) is representative of the general view, most answers are unapologetically against political correctness, hyper Islamophobic, generally opposed to freedom of religion and decriminalization of drug use, exhibit great schadenfreude towards the Middle Eastern refugee issue as a result of western intervention, [pro- Trump]( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/trump-china/550886/) and capital punishment and dog meat. Not to mention Tibet and Xinjiang and SCS issues...

I've often seen in comments on this sub being surprised at how different the Chinese and other perspectives may be. Such contrasts remind me a lot of online discussions on religion where premises and conclusions often fundamentally differ, such as:

https://www.quora.com/Are-atheists-afraid-of-reading-the-Holy-Bible-that-they-may-believe-in-God

> Q: Are atheists afraid of reading the Holy Bible that they may believe in God?

> A: Many atheists have read the Holy Bible and often disbelieve in God precisely because of having done so.

The Quora discussion above was what came to mind when I participated in the following discussion on this sub myself:

https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7lo7fu/why_is_there_no_mass_demand_in_china_for/

> Why is there no mass demand in China for political liberalism despite a widely travelled middle class?

I think that post was assuming that political liberalism and competitive multiparty elections ought to be attractive for their own merit, like how Christians see the words of the Bible. And to repeat my opinion in that post, in China such -isms are only seen as means to an end, and are discredited by the (whether real or not, but at least perceived) inability by the west to solve problems present in China. Actually when it comes to religions, I wonder if the prevalent attitude on religion has somehow influenced how people see these supposedly fundamental issues.

When it comes to ""why"", foreigners (yes of course foreigners don't all hold the same opinion and I am generalizing here) will of course bring up the typical talking points like censorship and media control, while many Chinese people (at least many who do take part in English discussions online) will stick to the party line. Foreigners will then accuse brainwashing and paid comments and Chinese will claim ulterior motives and bring out whataboutism, and everything comes to an impasse.

I really don't see any way out of the endless exchange of accusations. In geopolitical thinking it might just be the logical result of competition and conflict of interest, which can easily confound sincere suggestions with undermining attempts no matter what the real intention is.

I'm more interested in the implications of this phenomenon. Has China become largely immune to Western attempts at inducing social and political reform, because there is very little in terms of shared preferences, goals, and middle ground? If like the article argued, Western gestures like this are holding back the very cause they are supposed to promote, will Western politicians switch to engaging in other ways? There's something in the article that I think is relevant:

> There’s no reason to think that Rubio and his cohorts understand any of this. The Republican Party might be playing the “tough on China” card...

Here. The “tough on China” card. I suspect [many people do understand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-west-gets-real-about-china-1513074600)), or maybe I'm just putting faith on career politicians who ought to know a lot about the topic. I think maybe they don't have a choice either way. Popular attention on these issues fueled by the very divergence I talked about will compel politicians to keep bringing the issues up, for popularity and votes. Politicians bringing the issues up brings more popular attention on these issues. The attention becomes a self-reinforced cycle, exaggerated even further in the cycle by vocal minority and selective reporting on interesting news. On the other hand Chinese people and government see such issues brought up constantly and gets caught up in another self-reinforced cycle of ""you're out to get us"", going the other way. It's like disruptive selection in evolution! Maybe that's how it has always been. The politicians do counterproductive stuff because the product isn't the goal.

Or maybe I'm getting caught up in a self-reinforced cycle by vocal minority and selective reporting.

At the very least the Chinese government does not actively stay away from tackling any issue because of Western criticism, like when [the US embassy started publishing air quality data]( https://www.wired.com/2015/03/opinion-us-embassy-beijing-tweeted-clear-air/). Improvements are made on some issues and not on others. Otherwise the west can just keep making truly useful suggestions and watch China turn away from them as problems get more and more severe.

As a complete outsider to any real politics and related studies I just hope this makes some sense for people to discuss. Still feeling like I missed something I wanted to say.

By Philip Gordon

Just a few months into the Trump administration, it still isn’t clear what course the president’s foreign policy will ultimately take. What is clear, however, is that the impulsiveness, combativeness, and recklessness that characterized Donald Trump’s election campaign have survived the transition into the presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued to challenge accepted norms, break with diplomatic traditions, and respond to perceived slights or provocations with insults or threats of his own. The core of his foreign policy message is that the United States will no longer allow itself to be taken advantage of by friends or foes abroad. After decades of “losing” to other countries, he says he is going to put “America first” and start winning again.

It could be that Trump is simply staking out tough bargaining positions as a tactical matter, the approach to negotiations he has famously called “the art of the deal.” President Richard Nixon long ago developed the “madman theory,” the idea that he could frighten his adversaries into believing he was so volatile he might do something crazy if they failed to meet his demands—a tactic that Trump, whose reputation for volatility is firmly established, seems particularly well suited to employ.

The problem, however, is that negotiations sometimes fail, and adversaries are themselves often brazen and unpredictable. After all, Nixon’s madman theory—designed to force the North Vietnamese to compromise—did not work. Moreover, putting the theory into practice requires the capacity to act judiciously at the appropriate moment, something that Trump, as president, has yet to demonstrate. And whereas a failed business deal allows both parties to walk away unscathed if disappointed, a failed diplomatic gambit can lead to political instability, costly trade disputes, the proliferation of dangerous weapons, or even war. History is littered with examples of leaders who, like Trump, came to power fueled by a sense of national grievance and promises to force adversaries into submission, only to end up mired in a military, diplomatic, or economic conflict they would come to regret.

Will that happen to Trump? Nobody knows. But what if one could? What if, like Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, Trump could meet a ghost from the future offering a vision of where his policies might lead by the end of his term before he decides on them at its start?
It is possible that such a ghost would show him a version of the future in which his administration, after a turbulent start, moderated over time, proved more conventional than predicted, and even had some success in negotiating, as he has pledged, “better deals.” But there is a real risk that events will turn out far worse—a future in which Trump’s erratic style and confrontational policies destroy an already fragile world order and lead to open conflict—in the most likely cases, with Iran, China, or North Korea.

In the narratives that follow, everything described as having taken place before mid-March 2017 actually happened. That which takes place after that date is—at least at the time of publication—fiction.

**STUMBLING INTO WAR WITH IRAN**


It is September 2017, and the White House is consumed with a debate about options for escalation with Iran. Another dozen Americans have been killed in an Iranian-sponsored attack on U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and the president is frustrated that previous air strikes in Iran failed to deter this sort of deadly aggression. He is tempted to retaliate much more aggressively this time but also knows that doing so risks involving U.S. troops even further in what is already a costly and unpopular war—the very sort of “mess” he had promised to avoid. Looking back, he now sees that this conflict probably became inevitable when he named his foreign policy team and first started to implement his new approach toward Iran.
Well before his election, of course, Trump had criticized the Iran nuclear agreement as “the worst deal ever negotiated” and promised to put a stop to Iran’s “aggressive push to destabilize and dominate” the Middle East. Some of his top advisers were deeply hostile to Iran and known to favor a more confrontational approach, including his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; his CIA director, Mike Pompeo; his chief strategist, Steve Bannon; and his defense secretary, James Mattis. Some of Mattis’ former military colleagues said he had a 30-year-long obsession with Iran, noting, as one marine told Politico, “It’s almost like he wants to get even with them.”

During his campaign and first months in office, Trump whipped up anti-Iranian feelings and consistently misled the public about what the nuclear deal entailed. He falsely insisted that the United States “received absolutely nothing” from it, that it permitted Iran to eventually get the bomb, and that it gave $150 billion to Iran (apparently referring to a provision of the deal that allowed Iran to access some $50 billion of its own money that had been frozen in foreign accounts). Critics claimed that the rhetoric was reminiscent of the Bush administration’s exaggerations of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs in the run-up to the Iraq war. In February 2017, in response to an Iranian ballistic missile test, Flynn brashly declared that he was “officially putting Iran on notice.” Two days later, the administration announced a range of new sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and companies involved in the ballistic missile program.

Perhaps just as predictably, Iran dismissed the administration’s tough talk. It continued to test its missiles, insisting that neither the nuclear deal nor UN Security Council resolutions prohibited it from doing so. Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, even taunted Trump for his controversial immigration and travel ban, thanking him on Twitter for revealing the “true face” of the United States. Tehran also continued its policy of shipping arms to the Houthi rebels in Yemen and providing military assistance to Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, neither of which proved particularly costly to the Iranian treasury. U.S. efforts to get Russia to limit Iran’s role in Syria were ignored, adding to the White House’s frustration.
To the surprise of many, growing U.S. pressure on Iran did not immediately lead to the collapse of the nuclear deal. As soon as he took office, Trump ended the Obama administration’s practice of encouraging banks and international companies to ensure that Iran benefited economically from the deal. And he expressed support for congressional plans to sanction additional Iranian entities for terrorism or human rights violations, as top officials insisted was permitted by the nuclear deal. Iran complained that these “backdoor” sanctions would violate the agreement yet took no action. By March 2017, U.S. officials were concluding internally—and some of the administration’s supporters began to gloat—that Trump’s tougher approach was succeeding.

Different behavior on either side could have prevented relations from deteriorating. But ultimately, the deal could not be sustained. In the early summer of 2017, real signs of trouble started to emerge. Under pressure from hardline factions within Iran, which had their own interest in spiking the deal, Tehran had continued its provocative behavior, including the unjustified detention of dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, throughout the spring. In June, after completing a review of his Iran policy, Trump put Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations and announced that continued sanctions relief would be contingent on Iran’s release of all U.S. detainees and a return to negotiations to address the nuclear deal’s “flaws.” Instead of submitting to these demands, Iran responded with defiance. Its new president, a hard-liner who had defeated Hassan Rouhani in the May 2017 election, declared that in the face of U.S. “noncompliance,” Iran would resume certain prohibited nuclear activities, including testing advanced centrifuges and expanding its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. Washington was suddenly abuzz with talk of the need for a new effort to choke off Iran economically or even a preventive military strike.

The Trump administration had been confident that other countries would back its tougher approach and had warned allies and adversaries alike that they must choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States. But the pressure did not work as planned. China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom all said that the deal had been working before the United States sought to renegotiate it, and they blamed Washington for precipitating the crisis. The EU even passed legislation making it illegal for European companies to cooperate with U.S. secondary sanctions. Trump fumed and vowed they would pay for their betrayal.

As the United States feuded with its closest partners, tensions with Iran escalated further. Frustrated by continued Iranian support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Pentagon stepped up patrols in the Strait of Hormuz and loosened the rules of engagement for U.S. forces. When an Iranian patrol boat aggressively approached a U.S. cruiser, in circumstances that are still disputed, the U.S. ship responded with deadly defensive force, killing 25 Iranian sailors.

The outrage in Iran bolstered support for the regime and led to widespread calls for revenge, which the country’s new president could not resist. Less than a week later, the Iranian-backed militia group Kataib Hezbollah killed six U.S. soldiers in Iraq. With the American public demanding retaliation, some called for diplomacy, recalling how, in January 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke directly to defuse the situation after U.S. sailors drifted into Iranian waters. This time, the EU offered to mediate the crisis.

But the administration wanted nothing to do with what it considered the Obama administration’s humiliating appeasement of Iran. Instead, to teach Iran a lesson, Trump authorized a cruise missile strike on a known Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intelligence headquarters, destroying three buildings and killing a dozen officers and an unknown number of civilians.

Trump’s advisers predicted that Iran would back down, but as nationalist fervor grew in Iran, Tehran escalated the conflict, calculating that the American public had no desire to spend more blood or treasure in the Middle East. Kataib Hezbollah and other Shiite militias in Iraq, some directed by Iran and others acting independently, launched further attacks on U.S. personnel. Tehran forced the weak government in Baghdad to demand the Americans’ departure from Iraq, which would deal a huge blow to the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State, or ISIS.
As Washington reimposed the sanctions that had been suspended by the nuclear deal, Iran abandoned the limits on its enrichment of uranium, expelled the UN monitors, and announced that it was no longer bound by the agreement. With the CIA concluding that Iran was now back on the path to a nuclear weapons capability, Trump’s top advisers briefed the president in the Oval Office. Some counseled restraint, but others, led by Bannon and Mattis, insisted that the only credible option was to destroy the Iranian nuclear infrastructure with a massive preventive strike, while reinforcing the U.S. presence in Iraq to deal with the likely Iranian retaliation. Pompeo, a longstanding advocate of regime change in Iran, argued that such a strike might also lead to a popular uprising and the ousting of the supreme leader, an encouraging notion that Trump himself had heard think-tank experts endorse on television.

Once again, nervous allies stepped in and tried to broker a diplomatic solution. They tried to put the 2015 nuclear deal back in place, arguing that it now looked attractive by comparison. But it was too late. U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Arak, Fordow, Isfahan, Natanz, and Parchin led to retaliatory counterstrikes against U.S. forces in Iraq, U.S. retaliation against targets in Iran, terrorist attacks against Americans in Europe and the Middle East, and vows from Tehran to rebuild its nuclear program bigger and better than before. The president who had vowed to stop squandering American lives and resources in the Middle East now found himself wondering how he had ended up at war there.

**FIGHTING CHINA**

It is October 2017, and experts are calling it the most dangerous confrontation between nuclear powers since the Cuban missile crisis. After a U.S.-Chinese trade war escalated well beyond what either side had predicted, a clash in the South China Sea has led to casualties on both sides and heavy exchanges of fire between the U.S. and Chinese navies. There are rumors that China has placed its nuclear forces on high alert. The conflict that so many long feared has begun.

Of the many foreign targets of Trump’s withering criticism during the campaign and the early months of his presidency, China topped the list. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly accused the country of destroying American jobs and stealing U.S. secrets. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country,” he said. Bannon, who early in the administration set up a shadow national security council in the White House, had even predicted conflict with China. “We’re going to war in the South China Sea in five to ten years,” he said in March 2016. “There’s no doubt about that.”

Not long after the election, Trump took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, breaking with decades of diplomatic tradition and suggesting a potential change in the United States’ “one China” policy. It wasn’t clear whether the move was inadvertent or deliberate, but either way, Trump defended his approach and insisted that the policy was up for negotiation unless China made concessions on trade. “Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?” he tweeted. “I don’t think so!” In February 2017, after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump announced that the United States would honor the “one China” policy after all. Asia experts were relieved, but it must have infuriated the president that so many thought he had backed down. “Trump lost his first fight with Xi and he will be looked at as a paper tiger,” Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University of China, told The New York Times.

There were other early warning signs of the clashes to come. At his confirmation hearings for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson appeared to draw a new redline in the South China Sea, noting that China’s access to islands there “is not going to be allowed.” Some dismissed the statement as overblown rhetoric, but Beijing did not. The state-run China Daily warned that any attempt to enforce such a policy could lead to a “devastating confrontation,” and the Global Times said it could lead to “large-scale war.”

Then there were the disputes about trade. To head the new White House National Trade Council, Trump nominated Peter Navarro, the author of The Coming China Wars, Death by China, and other provocative books that describe U.S.-Chinese relations in zero-sum terms and argue for increased U.S. tariffs and trade sanctions. Like Bannon, Navarro regularly invoked the specter of military conflict with Beijing, and he argued that tougher economic measures were necessary not only to rectify the U.S.-Chinese trade balance but also to weaken China’s military power, which he claimed would inevitably be used against the United States. The early rhetoric worried many observers, but they took solace in the idea that neither side could afford a confrontation.

It was the decisions that followed that made war all but inevitable. In June 2017, when North Korea tested yet another long-range missile, which brought it closer to having the ability to strike the United States, Trump demanded that China check its small ally and announced “serious consequences” if it refused. China had no interest in promoting North Korea’s nuclear capacity, but it worried that completely isolating Pyongyang, as Trump was demanding, could cause the regime to collapse—sending millions of poor North Korean refugees streaming into China and leaving behind a united Korea ruled by Seoul, armed with North Korea’s nuclear weapons, and allied with Washington. China agreed to another UN Security Council statement condemning North Korea and extended a suspension of coal imports from the country but refused to take further action. Angry about Trump’s incessant criticism and confrontation over trade, Xi saw the United States as a greater danger to China than North Korea was and said he refused to be bullied by Washington.

At the same time, the U.S. current account deficit with China had swelled, in part because growing U.S. budget deficits required borrowing from abroad, thus driving up the value of the dollar. That, combined with Chinese intransigence over North Korea, convinced the White House that it was time to get tough. Outside experts, along with Trump’s own secretary of state and secretary of the treasury, cautioned against the risks of a dangerous escalation, but the president dismissed their hand-wringing and said that the days of letting China take advantage of Americans were over. In July, the administration formally branded China a “currency manipulator” (despite evidence that it had actually been spending its currency reserves to uphold the value of the yuan) and imposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. To the delight of the crowd at a campaign-style rally in Florida, Trump announced that these new measures would remain in place until China boosted the value of its currency, bought more U.S. goods, and imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea.

The president’s more hawkish advisers assured him that China’s response would prove limited, given its dependence on exports and its massive holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds. But they underestimated the intense nationalism that the U.S. actions had stoked. Xi had to show strength, and he hit back.

Within days, Xi announced that China was taking the United States to the World Trade Organization over the import tariff (a case he felt certain China would win) and imposed a 45 percent counter tariff on U.S. imports. The Chinese believed that the reciprocal tariffs would hurt the United States more than China (since Americans bought far more Chinese goods than the other way around) and knew that the resulting inflation—especially for goods such as clothing, shoes, toys, and electronics—would hurt Trump’s blue-collar constituency. Even more important, they felt they were more willing to make sacrifices than the Americans were.

Xi also instructed China’s central bank to sell $100 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds, a move that immediately drove up U.S. interest rates and knocked 800 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in a single day. That China started using some of the cash resulting from the sales to buy large stakes in major U.S. companies at depressed prices only fueled a nationalist reaction in the United States. Trump tapped into it, calling for a new law to block Chinese investment.

With personal insults flying back and forth across the Pacific, Trump announced that if China did not start treating the United States fairly, Washington might reconsider the “one China” policy after all. Encouraged by Bannon, who argued privately that it was better to have the inevitable confrontation with China while the United States still enjoyed military superiority, Trump speculated publicly about inviting the president of Taiwan to the White House and selling new antimissile systems and submarines to the island.

China responded that any change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan would be met with an “overwhelming response,” which experts interpreted to mean at a minimum cutting off trade with Taiwan (which sends 30 percent of its exports to China) and at a maximum military strikes against targets on the island. With over one billion Chinese on the mainland passionately committed to the country’s nominal unity, few doubted that Beijing meant what it said. On October 1, China’s normally tepid National Day celebrations turned into a frightening display of anti-Americanism.

It was in this environment that an incident in the South China Sea led to the escalation so many had feared. The details remain murky, but it was triggered when a U.S. surveillance ship operating in disputed waters in heavy fog accidentally rammed a Chinese trawler that was harassing it. In the confusion that ensued, a People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate fired on the unarmed U.S. ship, a U.S. destroyer sank the Chinese frigate, and a Chinese torpedo struck and badly damaged the destroyer, killing three Americans.

A U.S. aircraft carrier task force is being rushed to the region, and China has deployed additional attack submarines there and begun aggressive overflights and patrols throughout the South China Sea. Tillerson is seeking to reach his Chinese counterpart, but officials in Beijing wonder whether he even speaks for the administration and fear Trump will accept nothing short of victory. Leaked U.S. intelligence estimates suggest that a large-scale conflict could quickly lead to hundreds of thousands of casualties, draw in neighboring states, and destroy trillions of dollars’ worth of economic output. But with nationalism raging in both countries, neither capital sees a way to back down. All Trump wanted to do was get a better deal from China.

**THE NEXT KOREAN WAR**

It is December 2018, and North Korea has just launched a heavy artillery barrage against targets in Seoul, killing thousands, or perhaps tens of thousands; it is too soon to say. U.S. and South Korean forces—now unified under U.S. command, according to the provisions of the Mutual Defense Treaty—have fired artillery and rockets at North Korea’s military positions and launched air strikes against its advanced air defense network. From a bunker somewhere near Pyongyang, the country’s erratic dictator, Kim Jong Un, has issued a statement promising to “burn Seoul and Tokyo to the ground”—a reference to North Korea’s stockpile of nuclear and chemical weapons—if the “imperialist” forces do not immediately cease their attacks.

Washington had expected some sort of a North Korean response when it preemptively struck the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States, fulfilling Trump’s pledge to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring that ability. But few thought North Korea would go so far as to risk its own destruction by attacking South Korea. Now, Trump must decide whether to continue with the war and risk nuclear escalation—or accept what will be seen as a humiliating retreat. Some of his advisers are urging him to quickly finish the job, whereas others warn that doing so would cost the lives of too many of the 28,000 U.S. soldiers stationed on the peninsula, to say nothing of the ten million residents of Seoul. Assembled in the White House Situation Room, Trump and his aides ponder their terrible options.

How did it come to this? Even Trump’s harshest critics acknowledge that the United States had no good choices in North Korea. For more than 20 years, the paranoid, isolated regime in Pyongyang had developed its nuclear and missile capabilities and seemed impervious to incentives and disincentives alike. The so-called Agreed Framework, a 1994 deal to halt North Korea’s nuclear program, fell apart in 2003 when Pyongyang was caught violating it, leading the George W. Bush administration to abandon the deal in favor of tougher sanctions. Multiple rounds of talks since then produced little progress. By 2017, experts estimated that North Korea possessed more than a dozen nuclear warheads and was stockpiling the material for more. They also thought North Korea had missiles capable of delivering those warheads to targets throughout Asia and was testing missiles that could give it the capacity to strike the West Coast of the United States by 2023.

Early in the administration, numerous outside experts and former senior officials urged Trump to make North Korea a top priority. Accepting that total dismantlement of the country’s nuclear and missile programs was not a realistic near term goal, most called for negotiations that would offer a package of economic incentives and security assurances in exchange for a halt to further testing and development. A critical component, they argued, would be outreach to China, the only country that might be able to influence North Korea.

But the administration preferred a more confrontational approach. Even before Trump took office, when Kim blustered about developing the capacity to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon, Trump responded on Twitter: “It won’t happen!” On February 12, 2017, North Korea fired a test missile 310 miles into the Sea of Japan at the very moment Trump was meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate, in Florida. The next morning, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, announced that the United States would soon be sending a signal to North Korea in the form of a major military buildup that would show “unquestioned military strength beyond anything anyone can imagine.” Later that month, Trump announced plans for a $54 billion increase in U.S. defense spending for 2018, with corresponding cuts in the budget for diplomacy. And in March 2017, Tillerson traveled to Asia and declared that “the political and diplomatic efforts of the past 20 years” had failed and that a “new approach” was needed.

In the ensuing months, critics urged the administration to accompany its military buildup with regional diplomacy, but Trump chose otherwise. He made clear that U.S. foreign policy had changed. Unlike what his predecessor had done with Iran, he said, he was not going to reward bad behavior. Instead, the administration announced in the summer of 2018 that North Korea was “officially on notice.” Although the White House agreed with critics that the best way to pressure North Korea was through China, it proved impossible to cooperate with Beijing while erecting tariffs and attacking it for “raping” the United States economically.

Thus did the problem grow during the administration’s first two years. North Korea continued to test missiles and develop fissile material. It occasionally incited South Korea, launching shells across the demilitarized zone and provoking some near misses at sea. The war of words between Pyongyang and Washington also escalated—advisers could not get the president to bite his tongue in response to Kim’s outrageous taunts—and Trump repeated in even more colorful language his Twitter warning that he would not allow Pyongyang to test a nuclear-capable missile that could reach the United States.

When the intelligence community picked up signs that Pyongyang was about to do so, the National Security Council met, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed the president on his options. He could try to shoot down the test missile in flight, but shooting carried a high risk of missing, and even a successful intercept might provoke a military response. He could do nothing, but that would mean losing face and emboldening North Korea. Or he could destroy the test missile on its launch pad with a barrage of cruise missiles, blocking Pyongyang’s path to a nuclear deterrent, enforcing his redline, and sending a clear message to the rest of the world. Sources present at the meeting reported that when the president chose the third option, he said, “We have to start winning wars again.”

**LEARNING FROM THE FUTURE**

These frightening futures are far from inevitable. Indeed, for all the early bluster and promises of a dramatic break with the past, U.S. foreign policy may well turn out to be not as revolutionary or reckless as many fear. Trump has already demonstrated his ability to reverse course without compunction on a multitude of issues, from abortion to the Iraq war, and sound advice from some of his more seasoned advisers could moderate his potential for rash behavior.

On the other hand, given what we have seen so far of the president’s temperament, decision-making style, and foreign policy, these visions of what might lie ahead are hardly implausible: foreign policy disasters do happen. Imagine if a ghost from the future could have given world leaders in 1914 a glimpse of the cataclysm their policies would produce. Or if in 1965, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson could have seen what escalation in Vietnam would lead to a decade later. Or if in 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush could have been shown a preview of the results of the invasion of Iraq. In each case, unwise decisions, a flawed process, and wishful thinking did lead to a catastrophe that could have been, and often was, predicted in advance.

Maybe Trump is right that a massive military buildup, a reputation for unpredictability, a high-stakes negotiating style, and a refusal to compromise will convince other countries to make concessions that will make America safe, prosperous, and great again. But then again, maybe he’s wrong.",geopolitics,Obama

Enemies to the North, enemies to the South, enemies to the East and enemies to the West.

Such was the geopolitical situation China found itself in the dawn of a new century. Despite all the promises of a ""Peaceful Rise"", such notions faded like the fire works of the Beijing Olympics. Like its slogan: *One world one dream*, its all but words and not geopolitical realities. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak America and its allies (Japan, Philippines etc) was determined on containing the ""Chinese threat"" in East Asia. It began with Obama's pivot to Asia which saw significant build up of US military/economic/diplomatic power in East Asia and South East Asia with the specific purpose of containing Chinese influence/growth and breathing space within the region. Such worries within China could be illustrated by a quote from former Chinese President Hu Jintao who stated:

> [The United States has] strengthened its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region, strengthened the US-Japan military alliance, strengthened strategic cooperation with India, improved relations with Vietnam, inveigled Pakistan, established a pro-American government in Afghanistan, increased arms sales to Taiwan, and so on. **They have extended outposts and placed pressure points on us from the east, south, and west.**

*Robert Kagan, The World America Made, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 2012), p 65.*

#Trump's America and the escalation of China's containment 

This notion that China is under siege from the United States is further illustrated by Donald Trump's extreme anti-Chinese rhetoric and determination to contain China's rise via military/economic and diplomatic means. Although Trump misplayed his hand by shredding the TPP which could have greatly assisted his goals, he nonetheless through the economic trade war with China greatly damaged China's economic power around the globe. In the US-Trade war it was estimated that the US slapped a whopping US$550 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese products. China, in turn, has set tariffs on US$185 billion worth of US goods. [1] The US also in an attempt to stifle China's technological growth began a global crusade against the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, getting it banned in several allied countries like Australia/Japan and even going as far as arresting its executive Meng Wanzhou to use as a geopolitical hostage.[2]  In his legal commentary criminal defense lawyer Gary Botting, who has provided some legal advice to Meng’s defence team, and is one of the country's leading authorities on extradition law, described Meng's extradition case as ""silly"" and obviously a ""political type of enterprise that the United States is engaged in.""[3] This sentiment is further backed up by Joseph Bellinger, a former legal adviser and senior associate counsel to the George W. Bush administration who stated that ""[the charges levelled against Meng] go well beyond any set of criminal charges related to violations of U.S. sanctions in Iran of which I am aware."" [4] 

Therefore it can be said that at the turn of the decade, China finds itself increasingly surrounded by the US and its allies in both East and South East Asia. It finds a increasingly desperate and aggressive America who is willing arrest Chinese nationals for bogus charges to use as hostage. It finds a increasingly nationalistic Japan who glorifies its WW2 past in order to contain China for the future. It finds the failure of Liberal ideas in both Taiwan and Hong Kong, where mass HK riots and collaboration between HK protesters and the US govt [5] proved to the Chinese elites that Western ideas cannot always live in peace with the Chinese state. It finds the US and its allies doing everything it can to pressure and squeeze China from every direction. Surrounded by American led enemies and domestic issues such as pollution, demography and grim economic outlook [6] the Chinese elites and people found China in an increasingly desperate situation in an increasingly hostile world.

This brings me to my main point. I am not in anyway saying America or the West deserved the suffering COVID-19 brought to them, I am Australian myself and I have seen the virus doing tremendous damage to our society, our country our economy and even I dare say those who are close to us as well. But this is a subreddit concerned not with moral consideration but rather the study of how power/situation/geography etc influences the affairs of states and now I shall continue in this manner. 

#COVID-19 and its impact on the US and EU 

The COVID-19 crisis has brought the US and the entirety of the Western world onto its knees. Currently in the United States the worst hit country in the world, 37,000 Americans have died whilst almost 700,000 have been infected with the curve no where in sight. [7] The US currently has 22 million people unemployed due to the national lockdown, wiping out a decade of job growth and its rising in a pace not seen since the Great Depression [8]. In Europe America's key allies and economic partner are in disarray. With every major European country having at least 140,000 of its citizens infected with the exception of Britain (104,000 aprox) and its death rates already in the tens of thousands. The EU along with its economic lockdown has been economically crippled and is projected to see its entire economy shrink by -1% if not even -2.5% for 2020 [7] [9]. Such situations will leave EU extremely economic vulnerable in the foreseeable future and with rising populism within EU states like Italy due to the EU's poor handling of the crisis, the EU like the US will be severely distracted by its own incompetence and will focus on fixing domestic issues as opposed to China for the foreseeable future.  

> Italy’s political leaders from Left to Right have erupted in fury over the EU’s minimalist, insulting, and cack-handed response to the Covid-19 pandemic, warning that lack of economic solidarity risks pushing the bloc’s festering divisions beyond the point of no return. 

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/03/29/eu-project-mortal-danger-italy-spain-abandoned/

#COVID-19 and its impact on Japan  

In East Asia a similar story can be seen in Japan where the second wave of COVID-19 has hit the country hard. Economically SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. estimated that the cancelling of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will contract the Japanese economy by 1.4% which is terrible news for an economy that has just recently emerged from its Lost Decades of growth. Tragically despite all its attempts to cover up the virus (Allegation made by former Japanese PM) [10] it was forced to move the Olympics back to 2021 with Canada/Australia pulling out and the fear of further spreading COVID-19 around the globe due to the event. Currently Japan has spiked to almost 10,000 cases whilst the recovery rates sits at a mere 935. Under a new report released by the Japanese Health Ministry, Japan could risk a ""projected growth of almost 850,000 people and almost half of them could die if social distancing and other measures are not followed."" [11] Therefore like the US and EU I highly doubt Japan's main concern for the foreseeable future would be the containment of China but rather in dealing with the domestic fallouts due to its own incompetent handling of the COVID-19 crisis. 

#Concluding Remarks

So what is my point? My point is Corona Virus is China's golden opportunity as it weakened its opponents so much that at present their main concern is no longer China but rather on how to stand up again when COVID-19 has brought them to their knees. America's historical distraction from China to other issues such as the War on Terror and its downfall in the GFC is what allowed China to economically grow. And I dare say its mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis is what will give China breathing room to formulate a stronger position against future American encirclement against China in the future. 

> For example, it is becoming clear that the most important long-term geopolitical effect of the Sept 11 attacks was the way they distracted America from China's rise in the critical first decade of the century. That was when China's wealth and power surged so swiftly to the point that it could seriously challenge America's position in Asia, while America, distracted by the Global War on Terror, did not notice and could not respond. That hastened the long-term shift in power and influence from Washington to Beijing.

https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/covid-19-will-accelerate-americas-eclipse-by-china 

That is not to say China will walk away from the virus it has caused without consequence. Already Japan is planning to move production out of China, the US defunding the WHO due to ""Chinese influence/bias"" and the UK stating that ""business won't be as usual"" with China following the crisis. [12] The post COVID-19 world will be one filled with opportunities and threats by China. On one hand China now facing a crippled West will have more time to grow but on the other the regionalization of manufacturing will mean countries will depend on China less which will hurt China in the long run. Furthermore China initial cover up of the crisis has led to growing animosity and a rising desire for vengeance against China across multiple world governments. Such is the challenge China faces in this brave new world, but yet even if COVID-19 didn't happen would it be different? Probably not in my opinion, and if China can properly capitalize on the misfortunes of the West then it can prosper this decade like it did the last!

39,"Martin Indyk, former US Ambassador to Israel and Special envoy to Israel-Palestine negotiations: ""Trump’s Unfair Middle East Plan Leaves Nothing to Negotiate""",67.0,ez7n7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ez7n7p/martin_indyk_former_us_ambassador_to_israel_and/,41.0,1580898708.0,"Here is the article: [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2020-02-04/trumps-unfair-middle-east-plan-leaves-nothing-negotiate](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2020-02-04/trumps-unfair-middle-east-plan-leaves-nothing-negotiate)

&#x200B;

Martin Indyk is an experienced diplomat enmeshed in the Israel-Palestine for a long time. In this article he goes through each of what he views as the major issues and talks about what the status of these issues were in prior negotiations and how the Trump/Kushner plan addresses them. His argument is that what Trump's team has done is just go through the issues from prior talks and pick Israel's position on each issue. He argues that this approach misunderstands what is required if you are interested in reaching a negotiated peace treaty.

Key Quote:

>Even though Trump is quick to decry the failed efforts of past administrations, his team actually drew on the concepts, the principles, and even the wording of previous plans. Past U.S. mediators, however, tried to establish a basis for agreement by bridging the disparate positions of the two sides. The Trump team simply resolved the issues by sleight of hand: it decided each of the final status issues—borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and mutual recognition—in Israel’s favor before the negotiations even begin.

His examples:

**Security**:

>U.S. negotiators have always paid particular attention to securing the border between Jordan and a future Palestinian state, lest that frontier become a gateway for armies or terrorists crossing into the West Bank and thence into Israel. During the administration of former President Barack Obama, a team of U.S. security experts, in consultation with their Israeli and Palestinian counterparts, developed a plan by which Palestinian security forces could gradually assume control of the border; over a period of many years, the Palestinian forces would have the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment and capabilities.   
>  
>From that plan, the Trump team borrowed the concept of establishing security criteria and the metrics for measuring Palestinian progress—but applied them instead to internal security within the Palestinian state, with Israel being the ultimate judge of Palestinian performance. It resolved the matter of border security, meanwhile, by simply giving the entire Jordan Valley to Israel. The Trump plan would thereby surround the Palestinian state with Israeli territory, severing its contiguity with Jordan and turning Jericho into a Palestinian enclave and the Palestinian state into a Bantustan. 

**East Jerusalem**

>Since the Clinton administration, for example, the equitable basis of all U.S. proposals for Jerusalem has been the stipulation that the Arab suburbs of East Jerusalem should come under Palestinian sovereignty and the Jewish suburbs should come under Israeli sovereignty. The Trump plan, however, puts almost all of East Jerusalem’s Arab suburbs under Israeli sovereignty, leaving to the Palestinians one Arab suburb and a refugee camp on the eastern side of the wall that Israel abandoned during the second intifada. On that sliver of East Jerusalem, the Palestinians are now told they can build their capital, severed by the wall from both the al Aqsa mosque and the 300,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.

**The Old City:**

>Previous negotiators struggled to reconcile the competing claims to sovereignty over Jerusalem, particularly in the Holy Basin that encompasses the Old City and the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy sites therein. In the past, the negotiators sought to dissolve the sovereignty issue in favor of joint governance for the Old City. The Trump team instead resolved the matter by granting Israel sovereignty forever over the entire area, including the Christian and Muslim Quarters and the al Aqsa mosque.

**Settlements**:

>As to settlements, past Israeli and Palestinian negotiators considered having Israel annex the main settlement blocs situated along the 1967 border between Israel and the West Bank, so long as the Palestinians received equivalent land from Israel to compensate. Under such an arrangement, 85 percent of the settlers on some 3 to 5 percent of West Bank land would be absorbed into Israel. The outlying settlements in the heart of the West Bank would be evacuated to allow for a contiguous Palestinian state. Trump’s peace team adopted the idea of land swaps—but the plan offers arid land on the Egyptian border to compensate for the incorporation of all the West Bank settlements into Israel, including the outlying ones. The result would be a Swiss cheese Palestinian state with no possibility of territorial contiguity. Instead, the Trump plan proposes “transportational” contiguity, through tunnels that would connect the islands of Palestinian sovereignty. Those tunnels, of course, would be under Israeli control.",geopolitics,Obama

Talk starts at [09:00](https://youtu.be/AlaHGYlXntQ?t=540) and ends at 01:08:00. The remaining time is questions from the audience. This takes place at the University of Bucharest, Romania. In partnership with the Romania Energy Center (ROEC). The following is a summary of the entire talk.

# Background points

The following background points are introduced and discussed in the beginning of the talk and are recurring realities that underpin the entire subject.

**Background point #1**

Claims the  United States (US) is the most secure great power in the history of the world due to its geography, abundance of power (large population + wealth) and nuclear arsenal.(*This is a bold claim but one that can be backed up. The most comprehensive video of US geographic advantage [here](https://youtu.be/ILn85WKo0Qk). This cannot be understated and is something no one can fault the likes of Peter Zeihan for being confident about*)

In his own words: ""It doesn't get better than this"".


**Background point #2**

There are three strategic regions the US cares about. In the following order:

1) Europe

2) North-east Asia

3) Middle east

 The first two are the regions with most of the great powers and the last is where most of the oil is, which really matters for the US.

**Background point #3**

There is a difference between the *public* and the *elites*. Due to the point made in `Background point #1` the public does not care about foreign policy. The tendency for interventionism, as Mearsheimer claims, comes from the foreign policy elites.

# Before NATO (1900-1949)

The US is an isolationist country. Even after intervention in the first world war. What got the US out of isolation again was the attack on pearl harbor and subsequent war declaration from Germany. Mearsheimer points out that the US (again, because of `Background point #1`) has ""a very powerful isolationist impulse"". Hence why European powers worry about the US ""going home"". According to him, it is also important to remember that the Soviet Union played a key role of defeating the Germans. As allies of the US.

# Cold War NATO (1949-1989)

Even prior to the defeat of Japan the US wanted to pull forces out of Europe and ""come home"". Mearsheimer again reiterate that the US was a deeply isolationist country. The problem, however, is that the Soviets where a potential peer-competitor and all EU great powers where either in ruins or incapable of dealing with it. The US was never anxious to stay in Europe but where forced to because of `Background point #2`. The US could not afford to have the Soviets form a hegemony in Europe. Mearsheimer is keen to point out that neither the *public* and *the elites* had ""an appetite"" in military build up in Europe under what is now NATO. Thus the plan to get European great powers to handle it themselves.

The failure of Vietnam in the second half of the 20th century started the notion of pulling out all over the world with emphasis on reducing commitment to Europe (Mansfield Amendment, which was defeated in congress).

The golden years (1975-1989), the foreign policy establishment (note: not the *public*) becomes very committed to NATO. The US lost appetite for interventions in the third world (due to Vietnam) and focuses firmly on Europe. This commitment remained unchanged.

# Post-Cold War NATO (1990-1916)

(*There is a typo in his slide. I think he meant 1990-2016*)

Cold War ends, the Soviets pull out of eastern europe. The Soviets come together with the Americans to talk about the future of NATO. According to Mearsheimer the Soviets want the US to stay in Europe and NATO to remain intact as they know ""the Americans are the pacifiers"". Which means keeping NATO intact and the Germans down. Mearsheimer also point out that the Germans are in favour of this because ""they are afraid of themselves"" and the pacifying effect of the US will ease reunification. The Soviets, however, stress that they do not want NATO to expand.

The end of the cold war signals the unipolarity of the US. And subsequently the period where it abandons realpolitik and adopts the liberal hegemony. Which should expand from Western Europe into the East to make them ""part of the West"". Beginning the Era of NATO expansion (1999-2004). Mearsheimer emphasizes that it did not expand to counter russian influence. It was, according to him, ""a story we invented"" after the february 22th 2014 Ukraine crisis started. Prior to this, prominent Americans told Putin on numerous occasions that NATO expansion was not aimed at containing Russia. It was about trying to create a ""giant security community based on liberal principals that covered the entire European continent"".

Mearsheimer then claims there where two big expansions in the east:

1999: Poland, Czech republic, hungary

2004: Romania, baltic states and others.

Russians ""screamed bloody murder"" about the expansions but could not, and where not willing to do anything about it. This will eventually come to a head by the end of the 2008 bucharest summit which said unequivocally that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members. It was impossible because of German and French opposition for NATO to address this issue during the summit. Nevertheless, the Americans insisted on the decree at the end of the summit. Unsurprisingly in August 2008 (a mere 4 months after the summit) Russia invades Georgia. While Georgia was under the assumption the Western powers would protect it, they (Europe and the US) did nothing. That and Crimea where a result of the 2008 summit. Effectively a return to realpolitik.

Along a resurrection of Russian powers comes the continuing rise of China, which began to get integrated into the liberal created international economy in the early 1980's and eventual admission in the WTO. By the 2010's it became apparent it could be a real potential competitors. Similarly, prior to Putin, Russia was still reeling from the cold war. But by the turn of the decade it was now ""slowly crawling their way back"". The unipolar moment is coming to an end.

# NATO in the age of Trump

Mearsheimer sees two ways of thinking about NATO's direction:

1) **Focus on Donald Trump:** He is ""the force driver"", ""the person that matters"". If Europe knows the US is the ""pacifier"" and do not want them to leave they should focus on him. Mainly because of ""his overt contempt of NATO"" and because he ""has never seen an institution he didn't intensely dislike"". Making him a threat to the institution that keeps stability in Europe and other liberal allies (which he sees as ""free riders""). Mearsheimer then points out that in Congress in its current form isn't a meaningful check on the presidency. Claiming ""we live in the era of the imperial presidency"". Claiming he is *[Sui Generis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sui%20generis)* and a politician not to be underestimated.

> *It is important to note that he makes it pretty clear he does not personally like Trump*

2) **Focus on the rise of China:** Focus on ""the structure of the system"". As such what Trump does is not important but the rise of China is.

# Trump & NATO

While Trump has a dislike for the liberal institution mearsheimer claims he cannot kill NATO due to the foreign elite establishment (dubbed *the blob*). Similarly to how Barack Obama got elected on the platform of ""more nation building at home"". Similarly to Trump he was at odds with the interventionist policy. *The blob* defeated him and to some extend will do the same to Trump. Which then brings us to the real threat of NATO

# China and NATO

China  is a real potential peer competitors which will require the US's full attention and resources. This will cause them to pivot their interest to Asia — *away* from Europe. Especially considering Russia is not that much of a threat. Unlike Russia, China has the key building blocks of power (from a realist point of view):

* population
* wealth

While the United States will remain a powerfull country. China's population (even with the decrease due to the one child policy) cannot be understated. If China's today had Hong Kong's gross national income (GNI) it would be more than three times the GNI of the US. To compare to the situation during the cold war:

* Soviets had 1/3 the wealth of the US
* roughly equal size of population.

China has **3 times the population** and possibly twice the wealth (assuming China continues to rise) while the US has to project power from 6000 miles away.

Mearsheimer assumes China cannot rise peacefully and will try to dominate asia the same way the US dominates the Western hemisphere. He believes ""they would be crazy not to"". Any power in its position would do the same. Dominate so no one can threaten you. Which means pushing the Americans out of Asia and the need for a Western coalition.

# US strategic Interest Today.

The order of strategic interest pointed out in `Background point #2` has changed in very recent history.

1) **Asia** is now the most important area of interest followed by the persian gulf. While the foreign policy establishment is still committed to NATO if the need arises to pivot to East Asia they will leave Europe as ""it is just not that important from a strategic point of view"".

2) **The Persian gulf** has roughly 30 percent of the world oil supply and 55 percent of reserves. Those that control that oil matters. Especially to the Chinese which gets 25% of their oil from that region. Which is expected to become 54%. The Chinese will thus become militarily involved in that region. Mearsheimer points out that the Iranian and Chinese are growing closer and closer together for that strategic reason.

3) **Europe** has no potential hegemon like China is in East Asia.

* Germany is depopulating due to its low birth rate and will have the same population size as Britain and France.

* Russia is depopulating for the same reasons as Germany and its economy is in shambles. They are not going to dominate but continue to decline.

> It should be noted that John Mearsheimer has said many times he does not see Europe integrating as a single state claiming nationalism is still too strong. This falls in line with similar thoughts by fellow realist George Friedman. Who not only thinks Nationalism is too strong (""no one is willing to die for Europe"") but that the great level of integration will generate conflict not peace [1](https://youtu.be/r-8KV_GurLY). Furthermore, given his emphasis on the pacifying effect of US intervention in Europe it is safe to assume that he would agree with George Friedman's idea that the concert of Europe never went away. (edit: In [this video](https://youtu.be/2bMX7rboMiw) he explicitly stated that without the US as a pacifier there cannot be a United europe as it is just a collection of Nation states who identify with their nation first).

Mearsheimer goes as far as claiming the following:

**Europe and China will have good economic relations** and cannot help the US in balancing China. To him ""it makes perfect sense"" to let the Americans and the Asians deal with the Chinese. And even if it wanted to:

**Europe has little military power nor does it have any meaningful power projection capability.** The idea European powers will build military powers to help out in Asia is to him ""not a serious argument"". He even goes as far as saying European powers will train with the Chinese in the future.

# Bottom Line

Trump is not the greatest threat to NATO. The foreign elite is too invested in NATO. The greatest threat is the rise of China which will make the US pivot to Asia and leave Europe behind. This means that Europeans should hope China does not continue to rise.",geopolitics,Obama

This is an article written by **Minxin Pei**  about China's [Dual Circulation Policy China’s Fateful Inward Turn: Beijing’s New Economic Strategy as Spelled Out by the Resolution of the CCP Central Committee’s 5th Plenum](https://www.prcleader.org/pei-3?cid=55c783b3-5fee-4480-8e68-d50a6b845bd8) in the China Leadership Monitor on December 16, 2020. It analyzes the documents behind the Dual Circulation Policy made in CCP Central Committee’s 5th Plenum Since it was mentioned in a May 14 meeting of the [Communist Party Politburo.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/11/03/commentary/world-commentary/china-dual-circulation-strategy/) there has been a lot of speculation. While the speculation still continues, this document provides more clarity.

Dual circulation contains two parts, a domestic circulation, international circulation. The term international circulation was first used in 1988 by Wang Jian, a government researcher. who argued that China should pursue an export-led growth strategy, [plugging its vast pool of cheap labour into global production networks.](https://outline.com/meuLvg)

The only post about dual circulation here was written by [Former Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo's opinion piece on China](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/jkr3yd/former_singapore_foreign_minister_george_yeos/). And not surprisingly there was little discussion of dual circulation in the comment section.

THis post will be organized as follows.

I don't have much knowledge of the Chinese economy or China's domestic affairs, but I decided to do this because no one else here is talking about it. I strongly suggest people read [Trump Didn’t Kill the Global Trade System. He Split It in Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntlScholars/comments/d9h8ys/trump_didnt_kill_the_global_trade_system_he_split/), to get a sense of US views on trade historically, and various facets of the US rivalry with China.

# SUMMARY

The author starts by saying that if the

>3rd plenum of the CCP 11th Central Committee in December 1978 marks the beginning of China’s integration into the global economy under Deng Xiaoping’s leadership, the resolution passed by the CCP’s 19th Central Committee at its 5th plenum at the end of October 2020 likely signals a decisive reversal of China’s “opening” to the outside world

A plenum is held every nth Central Committee, during the 5th plenum they decide the goals and plans for the next Five Year Plan (2021-25) and the long term goals for the next 15 years.This could be seen as a response to increasing tensions with the US, and to a lesser extent its allies. Chinese leaders have come to realize that they must respond with a new economic strategy that reduces Chinese vulnerabilities to U.S.-initiated “de-coupling.”

The final document of the plenum was finalized on Oct 29, and serves as a aspirational document containing guidelines and objectives. In the coming months with NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission) serving as the lead agency, specific policies will be formulated.

The strategic rationale for the economic strategy is the deteriorating external situation. The resolution of the plenum reads

>Peace and development remain the dominant themes of our era. At the same time, the international environment is becoming increasingly complex.  Instability and uncertainty are growing significantly.  The impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic will be extensive and deep.  Economic globalization faces a counter-current. Unilateralism, protectionism, and hegemonism constitute a threat to the world’s peace and development

Liu He, Xi trusted economic advisor, places the economic rational ahead of the geopolitical for placing domestic demand over exports, arguing that China's per capita GDP is large enough to generate the demand. The worsening geopolitical environment is the only the main reason for securing supply chains and technological self reliance to "" increase the autonomy, sustainability, and resilience of economic development.

The Chinese leadership homes to double per capita income by 2035, but because of the geopolitical uncertainty choose not to set a hard quantitative target.

While the growth strategy of spelled out in the 5th Plenum contain many components, we will concentrate on three main components.

***Generating Domestic Demand*** **-** According to the author there are little new details on how domestic demand will be expanded. Domestic demand consists of consumption and investment. Xi also mentions the term ""domestic big circulation"" repeatedly in his speech at the Plenum's end Domestic big circulation involves better and smoother connections among production, distribution, logistics, and consumption and breaking up local and national monopolies. Beijing realizes it has to undertake market reform to order to boast efficiency and hence demand.

***Securing Supply Chains and*** ***Technological Self-sufficiency*** *-* There is new appreciation by the Chinese leadership on the need to secure China's supply chains and the technological self-sufficiency. To secure supply chains, China needs to do the following

* Improve China’s competitiveness in sectors where it is a leading producer (such as high-speed railway equipment, new energy, and telecom equipment) so as to increase the global dependence on China **and allow China to maintain a retaliatory and deterrent capacity against foreign parties’ deliberate cutting off supplies**
* Address deficiencies in the supply chain. China must build domestic supply network in sectors connected with national security and choke points.

The notable measures for technological self-sufficiency are

* Seek breakthroughs in core technologies, strengthen basic research, target artificial intelligence, quantum information, semi-conductors, life sciences, brain research, and other leading-edge sectors and fields.
* Investing in a number of forward-looking strategic “national priority science and technology projects” Beijing, Shanghai, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area will receive support to become international centers for scientific and technological innovation.
* Encouraging firms to invest in innovation through tax-based incentives and supporting firms to form innovation consortia
* Implementing more open recruitment policies to attract domestic and international talent.
* Investment in R&D will be increased, with the majority of the investment made by the state

***Development and National Security*** **-** Calls for strengthening capabilities to provide early warnings of risks and to prevent and control them. China must maintain its ability to secure and control critical industries, infrastructure, strategic resources, and major scientific and technological areas

**CONCLUDING OBERVATIONS**

The author makes two major observations. First, the author points out the Chinese leaders want their cake and eat it, by presenting a optimistic image of domestic and international dual circulation, with improved domestic circulation attracting global resources and factors, which will allow China to participate in the global economy on more favorable terms. Much of what is said about interaction between domestic and international circulation is cliched. There is no explicit goal to counter U.S. dominance in the global financial payment or U.S. dollar-dominated payment system. The only notable new formulation is the “promotion of joint high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative"", which could indicate a reduction in the number of projects.

Secondly, the Chinese leaders will assign the state the primary role to carry out the strategy. The role of the state-owned economy as a strategic pillar must be exercised *​​*

# ANALYSIS

Before going into analyzing Trade War and Dual Circulation, I am going to provide a conceptual framework on how to analyze US and China competition, followed by analysis of the cognitive biases of both the Western and Chinese leaders.

**WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE GAME?**

To approach the US-China rivalry dispassionately its best to think of it as a tabletop strategy game. You have your rules, pieces and the map.

First, we are at a phase in the game where its largely economic, diplomatic and psychological with technology and military still playing a minor role.

**Raw Power and Networks**

The rivalry involves the interaction between raw power and leveraging networks both under one's immediate control, and those that are affiliated, neutral or even opposing. Countries use networks to spread influence and exert leverage, and allow them to do so with little expenditure of raw power (force, money).

In 1945, the United States made up 50% of the world GDP, it short it had a lot of raw power. As a victor of the war, it was able to establish bases in both East Asia and Europe, they gradually expanded the bases in the two regions, and eventually the Middle East and Africa. However, despite its power, it had weak networks compared with Britain, which was the premier network power of the era. The US spent the next 75 years talking over Great Britain existing networks (Finance) and building its own.

There are many types of networks trade, retail, finance. religious, cultural, ethnic, hardware, software, manufacturing supply chains, entertainment academic and military.

Networks are designed for specific purposes. US military alliances are military alliance, and you don't use a military tool to solve a economic problem. Not all networks are equal. The EU is a strong economic network,and can generate leverage when it reaches a consensus. whereas RCEP cannot

However, networks can also destabilize a country, with Wall Street and Facebook being good examples. The Untied States has a high tolerance for the instability these network can cause to itself, because the positives outweigh the negatives.

**Leverage and Resilience**

The aim of countries in the contemporary geopolitical game is to increase leverage and resilience. Leverage is used to pressure the other party during negotiation or weaken an opponent

What China realized in the trade war, is the United States has more leverage over China than the reverse. The US imposed tariffs over Chinese goods, and putting Chinese companies on the [United States Entity List](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-adds-24-chinese-companies-entity-list-helping-build). The only leverage China was willing to use was rare earths, like it did with Japan, but didn't.

However, tariffs didn't have much impact on China's total exports.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a66cx7nnyn661.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fb28c0503f8b03f3c2acafb8fbdabf7b089bb92

The large spike in China's exports in 2020, is due to demand for medical equipment and IT, as countries grapple with coronavirus. I expect it to [revert back to pre0-2020 trends, which is stagnation](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/exports).

Where the was a sharp drop in Chinese exports to United States in 2019, and would have continued in 2020 if it weren't for Covid-19.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqekjebpyn661.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e34e90e3e0dd6185937d527d59b3633429b8d851

If your aim is reduce dependency on China and shift production to ASEAN in the long run, the tariffs are viable, though there are most likely better tools to use. Asean's exports to the US are half that of China's

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fitr88eqyn661.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=361e1dbce652916985c7d19cf5290d20e2f0f8ad

&#x200B;

Even if United States imposed tariffs to change China's behavior a decade ago, I doubt it would be effective, given the difficult of shifting supply chains quickly. It might be even more difficult, given ASEAN exports to the US were only 1/4 of China's in 2010

Far more effective use of leverage, was the United States putting Chinese companies on its negative entity list. Through its technological and financial network, it banned US companies and those in other allied countries (ie Taiwan) from doing business with Chinese companies on the entity. US actions against [Huawei have crippled the company in the short to medium term](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3111973/two-years-huawei-still-fighting-survival-cfo-extradition-case-ongoing). And the [US continues to add more Chinese companies to the list](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/troubles-at-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-smic/)

China was exposed. It should strive to do the following “Where linkages with the global economy create vulnerabilities, China wants to minimise them,” says Andrew Polk of Trivium China, a research firm. “Where the linkages create benefits, China wants to expand them.”

Economic resilience is one aspect to consider when it comes to applying leverage, one must also take into resilience of the targeted population. Filipinos most likely have weaker resilience in the face of Chinese pressure relative to the Vietnamese. The same could be said of the US, [US farmers still remained loyal to Trump despite having been negatively impacted by the trade war and Covid-19,](https://theconversation.com/most-us-farmers-remain-loyal-to-trump-despite-pain-from-trade-wars-and-covid-19-146535)

**DUAL CIRCULATION: DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT**

The most difficult aspect of the Dual Circulation policy lies in what supply chain and technologies you would need to develop. Do you wait until the US sanctions the industry to develop it? Or do you pick critical sectors that you think would come under attack. The problem with the first, is it often take years to develop a technology. The second option is figuring which industries to develop is like hitting a moving target. It becomes indefinitely more difficult, as the US recruits more of it's allies, This diverts spending in research fields under China 2025 like Robotics, AI and Green Energy

The drive fot technological self-sufficiency isn't new. For example in Semiconductors, China has invested US$22 Billion in a [National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/14/china-technology-sanctions-huawei-chips-semiconductors/) in 2014. The US is moving down the value chain, stopping the export of equipment used for chip production.

Secondly, while much of the funding for R&D is funded by the state, in the last couple of years, China has increasingly involved the private sector. At the same time, China has also tightened party control of the private sector. According to a survey of private companies the % of those with party [committees has increased from 36% in 2012 to 48% in 2018](https://macropolo.org/party-committees-private-sector-china/?rp=m). Beijing has made these committees mandatory for listed companies.

According to the [Wall Street Journal](https://archive.is/QQ0c3)

>The risk for China is that Mr. Xi’s vigorous assertion of statist prerogatives will dull the kind of innovation, competitive spirit and unbridled energy that powered China’s explosive growth in recent decades. The economic policies that helped nurture e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., tech conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other global success stories seem to be at an end, say economists inside and outside China

Thirdly, a contradictory aspect is China's opening up its financial markets. While it will help internationalize the Yuan thus reducing dependency on US$ and creating leverage with Wall Street, it opened to much it will expose Chian to vagaries of the capital market

Lastly, according to the Economist,

>Even more striking was his inversion of the idea of international circulation. Instead of talking about it in terms of the economic benefits China reaps from globalisation, he emphasised only the strategic purpose of opening China’s doors to foreign firms, ie that making them more dependent on the Chinese market would deter foreign powers from putting pressure on the country

Basically, Xi Jinping views foreign investment largely from the [viewpoint of leverage.](https://outline.com/meuLvg)

**DUAL CIRCULATION: EXTERNAL IMPACT**

While some have speculated China focus its exchanges with developing world and non-Western developed countries like South Korea and Singapore, I believe its premature to rule out continued exchange with European countries.

The BRI has been [scaled back considerably since](https://archive.is/V1Luf) 2018, and I expect it funding to be furthered reduced as a result of Covid-19 and dual circulation. There will be far fewer projects, but of higher quality

Given the China's response in the early period of Covid-19 and China's dual circulation, its most likely developed economies will make deals with friendly developing countries for the production of critical equipment and supplies that are two expensive to produce in their countries.

**CHINA'S PROBABLE COURSE OF ACTION UNDER BIDEN**

Because of Covid-19, its unlikely Biden will do much on the China front for the next 12-18 months. During this period, the Chinese government will try to get into the good graces of Biden, in the hope of renegotiating the trade agreement and getting their companies delisted from the entity list. Since the election, the Trump administration wants to lock Biden in an anti-China direction. However, by the time Biden focuses on China, the United States will be heading into midterm elections. While foreign policy is rarely a big issue in US Congressional elections, in close races, every vote counts. The Republicans [will make every effort to paint the Democrats as weak on China, because anti-China stance gets votes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/04/25/republicans-see-attacks-on-china-as-a-winning-strategy-for-2020/?sh=443fe5ac3473).

In such circumstances, Chinese will do their best not to make life difficult for Biden until after mid-terms. From reading the above analysis by **Minxin Pei** China is still hedging, technology self-sufficiency can be relatively narrow or very expansive, based on what the US does.

The current situation between the China and US, reminds me of relations between CHina and Indonesia between 1965-67. At the time, Indonesia was divided between Indonesian Communist Party (about 3 Million members and 7 million belonging to affiliated organization) backed by the Navy and Airforce vs the Army and religious groups. President Sukarno was increasingly siding with the Communist. China backed the Sukarno and the Communist The Indonesian Army accused China of backing a Communist assassination of six generals, which caused them to stage a counter coup, and a purge of 500,000 Communists. [Sukarno's power was slowly ebbing, but China kept a low profile, hoping Sukarno would regain power.](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Chinese_Policy_Toward_Indonesia_1949_196/oboWNz-7biUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=China+indonesia+relations&printsec=frontcover) The Army was intent on cutting relations with China because they saw it as the foreign backer of the coup and a security threat, suspended diplomatic and direct economic ties with China in 1967. Ties were restored om 1990.

# CONCLUSION

The Chinese leadership expected the US would one day see China as a strategic threat; however, as Wang Qishan, a Vice President, told a acquaintance, [“This rupture came 10 years earlier than we expected,”](https://www.noemamag.com/china-readies-for-a-new-cold-war/) This statement, along with China's lack of leverage, shows the China misread the situation in the US, and thus was caught unprepared. Despite Chinese proclamations that the turning point was Obama's Asia pivot, the reality is the senior Chinese leadership didn't see it as serious.",geopolitics,Obama

I love this subreddit!**

I know it's kind of an inflammatory title but I was reading an essay written by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1997, [**""A Geostrategy for Eurasia.""**](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/53392/zbigniew-brzezinski/a-geostrategy-for-Eurasia) In which ZB makes a pretty extraordinary claim.

ZB first writes of enlarging NATO and EU in stages (Central Europe first, Baltics by 2005, then Ukraine by 2010). 

Regarding Russia, he writes: 

> New Russian ties with NATO and the EU, formalized by the Joint NATO-Russia Council, may encourage Russia to make its long-delayed post-imperial decision in favor of Europe.... Russia's first priority should be to modernize itself rather than to engage in a futile effort to regain its status as a global power. Given the country's size and diversity, a decentralized political system and free-market economics would be most likely to unleash the creative potential of the Russian people and Russia's vast natural resources. **A loosely confederated Russia -- composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic -- would also find it easier to cultivate closer economic relations with its neighbors. Each of the confederated entities would be able to tap its local creative potential, stifled for centuries by Moscow's heavy bureaucratic hand. In turn, a decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization.** Russia is more likely to make a break with its imperial past if the newly independent post-Soviet states are vital and stable. Their vitality will temper any residual Russian imperial temptations. Political and economic support for the new states must be an integral part of a broader strategy for integrating Russia into a cooperative transcontinental system. **A sovereign Ukraine is a critically important component** of such a policy, as is support for such strategically pivotal states as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.

Can you imagine if a Russian or Chinese scholar wrote that America should ""decentralize"" into a collection of Americastans so that Dallas and Chicago could achieve better economic integration with Mexico and Canada respectively?

ZB writes this, of the EU - which helps illuminate his comments on Russia:

> Europe is America's essential geopolitical bridgehead in Eurasia. America's stake in democratic Europe is enormous... any expansion of Europe's political scope is automatically an expansion of U.S. influence.... A wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve the short-term and longer-term interests of U.S. policy. A larger Europe will expand the range of American influence without simultaneously creating a Europe so politically integrated that it could challenge the United States on matters of geopolitical importance, particularly in the Middle East. A politically defined Europe is also essential to Russia's assimilation into a system of global cooperation.... [obstructing] the emergence of a more united Europe could prove calamitous for Eurasian stability and America's interests. Unless Europe becomes more united, it is likely to become more disunited again...

Aside from the rather direct statement that ""an expansion of Europe is an expansion of U.S. influence,"" he seems to be saying indirectly

- that EU is an instrument of US geopolitics

- that EU is designed to prevent the unification of Europe into a single geopolitical unit that could threaten US hegemony. The EU does this by preventing war (previous threat of unification under Napoleon, Hitler) and also by preserving national sovereignties (to prevent peaceful unification).

- expansion of ""democratic Europe"" (translation: EU/NATO) is a tool to put pressure on Russia to ""choose"" to ""abandon its imperial past"" (translation: collapse into a collection of weak states)

- a strong ""independent"" (translation: European-controlled) Ukraine is geopolitically critical to pressure Russia by threatening the Ukraine-Caspain gap (i.e. control of Baku and Astrakhan, just as in WWII).

Does ZB speak for most NATO-aligned thinkers here? or is he being especially ""Polish"" in his analysis of Russia?

EDIT: I guess I should clarify that I am no Putin-phile, I think the post-USSR states have every reason to want to integrate with the west. My question is **what is USA's interest** in all this. Russia is already ""contained"" today and is practically encircled by NATO states. Obama just flew to the Baltics to reconfirm their Article 5 significance. What is practically achieved by encroaching even further?",geopolitics,Obama

Clearly, however, the transatlantic relationship can not merely be saved by ""waiting out Trump"" if the elephant in the room is not addressed: China. It would seem that the United States would need to find some impetus for Europe to join it in its isolation (not sure if containment is a suitable word) of China, which will be quite difficult, even in the aftermath of COVID-19, which seems to be driving a significant wedge between Europe and China. However, Europe is heavily dependent on China. Geopolitically, it is far less vulnerable to Chinese aggression, making it less likely to confront China.

Things may not be all doom and gloom however. The European Union and United States are still heavily interconnected with regard to defense, economy, culture, and scientific endeavors. Even Germany, one of the fiercest European critics of Trumpian America, still regards it as its most vital partner aside from France. Though Britain has left the EU, thereby weakening integration which (until now) has been a shared goal of the EU and US, the island nation has an opportunity to embed itself in North America's trading bloc (I see few other options for it). There also lies the question of Central and Eastern Europe, where the US enjoys considerable political support, and is more reliant on American security than ever in the face of perceived Russian aggression (i.e. Georgia and Ukraine).

Though America's erratic and inconsistent foreign policy is the rule, and most definitely not the exception, has the country departed too radically from its traditional role this time?

The US and EU's relationship will be pivotal in the years to come, especially as revisionist authoritarian powers are seeking to revise the current world order.

1. [Senator John McCain independently contacted the Australian ambassador after Trump's phone call with the Australian PM](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mccain-makes-nice-australia-after-trump-s-blunt-talk-pm-n715916), and likewise made public statements about US-AUS alliance. Whether you view McCain's efforts as a (well intentioned and friendly) ""cleanup"" or a (hostile) attempt to contradict/undermine the Administration's diplomatic line, this kind of ""second lane"" diplomacy has been happening in public in many other cases (e.g. UK, NATO). It seems to me to have little precedent.

3. **Without getting political**, outside-America observers may perceive relatively big ""known unknowns"" about the Trump presidency compared to the usual state of affairs for an incoming President. For example [the US Senate's counterintelligence investigation into Russian possible influence on the election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/senate-intelligence-committee-trump-aides-russia-links) has the potential to *at least* cause the dismissal of high ranking administration officials such as Flynn. [Currently, public polls show about 40% of US public wants Trump impeached.](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/02/after-2-weeks-voters-yearn-for-obama.html) This is higher than on the eve of Clinton's impeachment, and even for Nixon for all but the tail end of the Watergate affair. While part of this figure could be explained by deepening partisanship in USA politics, it raises uncertainty for foreign observers of US's internal politics.

Do you think - again, as a purely apolitical question - state actors are hedging on the idea that Trump may not be their 4 year diplomatic partner? 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of publicly engaging in ""two lane"" diplomacy? Surely at least one disadvantage would be earning the ire of the Trump Administration.

So I thought that I would shed light on Pakistan's core interests/concerns in Afghanistan. Perhaps, it will give people an understanding of Pakistan's motivations and goals in the country. There are other interests besides these, but in my opinion these form the most important ones. The list isn't necessarily in any particular order. 

**1. Recognition of the Durand Line by the Afghan government**

The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is from the British Era, and the Afghan government does not recognize it. Instead it claims the western regions of Pakistan (i.e. Khyber province & Balochistan) as part of its territory. It believes, that Pashtuns were seperated due to this border and all Pashtuns are therefore Afghan. Now interestingly, the largest Pashtun country isn't Afghanistan....but Pakistan where there are twice as many Pashtuns and they form the second largest ethnic group in the country. The overwhelming majority of Pakistani pashtuns strongly identify as Pakistanis and don't want to be part of Afghanistan. In fact, the Pakistani military and especially the ISI has a relatively higher amount of Pashtuns than their respective population proportion.

It is due to this irredentist views over the Durand line that Afghan governments have supported Pashtun militant groups, and even [invaded Pakistan](http://www.thebajaur.net/2013/08/History-Of-Bajaur.html) (Bajaur Agency) in the 60's to lay claim to territories. The Afghan government is also suspected of being behind the assassination of Pakistan's first Prime Minister-Liaquat Ali Khan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saad_Akbar_Babrak). Afghanistan was the only country in 1947, which refused to recognize Pakistan. 

Part of the reason Pakistan got involved in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion, was because it felt that a Soviet allied Afghan would have stronger support in invading Pakistan's western regions or fomenting insurgency in the border areas. 

**2. Afghan government containing the flow of refugees/illegal migrants in Pakistan**

It is interesting for me to see Europeans panicking over the flow of a few thousand refugees, as Pakistan hosted the largest refugee population for about 3 decades. Currently there are more than 2 million Afghan refugees (many more undocumented), but during the Soviet invasion the number was estimated to reach about 4 million. Afghan refugees, are often viewed as bringing 'gun-culture', gangs, religious extremis, drugs and violence into major urban areas and destabilizing the country. Pakistan is already a relatively poor country and does not have the resources to look after these refugees, even if you account the minimal refugee aid given by the UN

**3. Afghan government controlling the flow of drugs and smuggled goods into Pakistan**

There is millions of dollars of undocumented/un-taxed trade that happens near the border region, which Pakistan would like to oversee. Additionally, Pakistan and Iran are estimated to have the highest use of heroin, as majority of Afghanistan's opium is shipped out through these countries. This drug menace is a real concern for the country. 

**4. Afghan soil should not become a launching pad for Indian government against Pakistan.**

Pakistan views Afghanistan through an India-Pakistan prism to a large extent, where it feels that India is using Afghan soil to attack Pakistan and fund militants. [Please see this post of mine about](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/5ktluu/balochistan_conflict_in_pakistan_2004_present/dbscj4z/) India using Afghan soil to destabilize Pakistan. It has sources from Chuck Hagel (former Defence Secretary), Pakistan's fiercest critics (Christine Fair) as well as Wikileaks. 

**5. Afghanistan funding terrorist/militant groups inside Pakistan**

The main threat now in Pakistan is terrorist attacks from TTP. During the last few years Pakistan was conducting large-scale operations in its tribal areas to remove the Tehreek Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Many of these TTP fighters went across the border during these operations and pledged allegiance to ISIS. During this time, the Afghan intelligence was actually aiding the now ISIS allied TTP terrorists to attack Pakistan...and the Americans even knew what the Afghans were upto. [Source-NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/world/asia/us-disrupts-afghans-tack-on-militants.html)

The Obama administration has often scapegoated Pakistan for many of their failures in Afghanistan, by blaming the Haqqanis. The American media fails to mention that about 40% of Afghanistan is under Taliban rule and they actually have grassroots support in the rural Pashtun regions (the largest constituency in Afghanistan). This is why Pakistan from the beginning of 9/11 has said that the solution needs to be a unity government where the Taliban are incorporated into the civilian administration. Now Russia, Iran and China have openly established contacts with the Taliban as well, and are pushing for the same thing....especially as ISIS is taking a foothold in Afghanistan.

Some of the worlds deadliest terrorists have been killed in Pakistan through US drone strikes. So how come in recent years as the war in Afghanistan has intensified in its death toll, the US has completely abandoned its drone programme in Pakistan? 

There were over 400 drone strikes under Obama. At its peak there was a major drone strike every week. As Trump took charge, there has been a massive increase in drone strikes in places like Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan. However there have been only a handful of drone strikes in Pakistan since then, with the last one taking place in January 2018, over two years ago. 

So why is it that the US has seemingly suspended its drone programme in Pakistan, and what consequences does it have overall with the Afghan war.",geopolitics,Obama

If you are looking for the short answer to the question, here it is: sort of, but not really. For those who are looking to have a more in-depth answer, allow me to try to provide some perspective.

To begin with, one must understand what we really mean when we say 'US power'. American power is derived from a number of factors, which include (but are not limited to): its influence, its diplomatic reach, its innovative businesses, and its cultural appeal. I would argue, however, that its emergence from World War II as not only a victor, but also one that emerged with its territory (with the exception of Pearl Harbor) and infrastructure relatively unscathed, helped to sustain its emergence as a superpower well into the beginning of the Cold War. That momentum was further maintained as a result of its possession of nuclear weaponry, which gave the US a new 'toy' with which to experiment, and enhance its power on the global stage. 

The end of WW2 saw the emergence of the US military as a deadly fighting force.

Since the US was not directly attacked during WW2 (again, with the exception of Pearl Harbor), its industries were also untouched. The expansion of its manufacturing industry barely slowed down after the end of the war, and continued along at a healthy pace. New jobs and sectors were cropping up at a pace which ensured not only economic health, but overall prosperity that was felt by a number of strata of society - which would lead to the 'baby boom' phenomenon. 

The end of WW2 saw the US emerge as an advanced economic power. 

In other words, the two main pillars of American power are its military, and its economy. Osama bin Laden recognized this fact when the Pentagon and the World Trade Center were targeted for suicide attacks, so there must be something to the theory.

Today, what is state of the US military? Whilst the US armed forces have been stretched to capacity since 9/11, the military retains the capability to strike at any enemy globally within a very short time frame (depending if we're talking about air strikes, which would be under 24 hours, or a Marine Expeditionary Force, which would normally be within 3 days). To put that in perspective - the US military can strike at its foes faster than Amazon can normally deliver a package to most countries (without the same day delivery option, of course). Effectively, the US remains incredibly powerful in that regard. 

The problem lies herein: Russia and China are modernizing their militaries at a rate which has sent some tremors through the established status quo. These two countries both have their own reasons for spending more money on their armed forces, and in short, it has to do with solidifying regional dominance. Both countries fear the US can threaten that ambition. In Ukraine, we see Russia trying to flex its muscles in its backyard, whereas China is busy constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea to challenge both its neighbors, and the US. In both cases, the US can challenge these moves, but should only do so when fully committed to all potential outcomes, even if that means (one hopes it is not the case) conflict. This is something that President Obama has unfortunately failed to do, particularly in the 'Syria-Chemical-Weapon-Red-Line' situation. Only when a country is prepared to do what it says it will do can it retain credibility on the world stage. 

The US also boasts more aircraft carriers than all of the following countries in the top ten - combined. Whilst not all carriers can be at sea at once (repairs, shore leave, refitting, etc), it gives America an incredible edge. 

But, whilst the US has both the absolute, and relative edge - its relative edge will start to slip a bit as China and Russia begin to modernize fully. It will take some years for either side to threaten with its conventional capability (I will leave out the nuclear consideration for the time being - MAD ensures that both sides lose in any case), but I believe it will happen, sooner rather than later. Why? Because the lead the US had was based on it having a far stronger economy (which we will get to), whilst China and Russia had relatively weaker ones. China is going to catch up in the coming years (although perhaps not on a Purchasing Power Parity level for a long time yet), and Russia's new military direction of hybrid war (disinformation, troop infiltration, inciting uprisings, etc) will make leaders at the Pentagon squirm in their chairs to some degree. It will also erode at the US military's ability to be intimidating from a conventional point of view.

From an economic perspective, the US had done quite well on the whole throughout the Cold War. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a death knell to communism, but a massive boost to capitalism - with the US as its figurehead. The global economy has undergone a number of rises and falls (the dotcom bubble and the 'great recession' of 2008 - ? being some of the more remarkable events).

But the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was more than just the herald of a massive recession - it was an event which had wide ranging consequences (don't forget, it was followed up by a sovereign debt crisis in Europe just a few years later, which still stings the continent to this very day). One of these consequences has been the lack of liquidity in the markets, which has also slowed down bank lending in a number of cases. This means slower economic growth globally (or at least, one of the reasons), and governments seeking to tackle their debts. This hit the US also, where a Republican Congress made sure to hit the Obama administration as hard as it could on a number of issues, seeking to rein in government spending (and of course, score some political points). Whilst the US and global economy seem to be recovering at an anemic rate, the IMF has repeatedly said that the recovery remains fragile. 

A weak global economy may threaten the US directly, but the events of 2008 have thrown an ugly light on some of the excesses of liberal markets and capitalism - the model promoted by the US so heavily since 1945. It affects the world's view of capitalism, with a number of countries now seeking to emulate China, due to its economic model of more stringent government controls over the economy and its market potential. The US is not as attractive as it perhaps used to be, but the use of the US Dollar as the world's reserve currency remains the most obvious indicator of US economic might and reliability on the international stage. 

So, whilst US power is on the wane to some degree in relative terms, in absolute terms , its power is immense. The world had rarely spoken of challenges to US power between 1989 and 2008, but that was never going to be a situation that was going to last indefinitely. Every empire is challenged at some point. The question here is: will the US seek to retain its prominent position at the head of the global power table in the coming decades by continuing to innovate in its economy, engage its allies, and improve its defense capabilities? Or will it allow its power to stagnate by shirking from the challenges of its rivals? 

On a no-change scenario (assuming the US continues along its current trajectory), there is no reason to think the US will not be one of the strongest powers in world by the year 2100. Will it be the sole superpower? Probably not. But retaining superpower status into the 22nd century would be no mean feat. 

And by no means is it impossible. ",geopolitics,Obama

# Israel's Threat Against Iran: How Netanyahu and Barak Stoked a War Scare to Pressure the U.S.

It's unclear whether Israel was bluffing or not, but the threats forced the Obama administration to ratchet up sanctions, new study says

By Amos Harel

Haaretz   Aug 21, 2018 2:20 PM 

Dr. Daniel Sobelman, today a lecturer on international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, researched this period in his post-doctoral work at Harvard. In an article published last week in the Texas National Security Review, Sobelman (who was once Haaretz’s Arab affairs correspondent), summarized his conclusions, which were also based on interviews with senior Israeli and American officials who were involved in contacts with Iran in those years. Among them were former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Defense Minister Ehud Barak and former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo. 

Focusing on the years 2011–2012, Sobelman surveyed Israeli efforts to persuade the United States that it was seriously considering a unilateral assault, intending to lead Washington to take a harsher stand against Iran, and in so doing serve Israel’s interests. Did Israel really plan to attack Iran? Sobelman, like journalists and researchers who have examined this question in the past (and some were themselves involved in it), did not reach an unequivocal conclusion. But some of his interlocutors conceded that preparations were serious and that the United States conducted extensive surveillance of Israel to determine its intentions. 

Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-benjamin-netanyahu-1.5599046) and Barak, Sobelman writes, intentionally created a panic of war to improve Israel’s bargaining abilities with the United States, which feared that a regional war would harm American interests. The pair sought a specific and reliable American commitment to stop Iran from reaching nuclear weapons capability, which was more than what President Barack Obama had pledged until then. Despite the close ties between Israel and the United States, their interests did not overlap when it came to Iran. From 2011, the U.S. conducted secret talks with Iran through Oman. Israel leaked word of the talks in order to disrupt them. Sobelman quotes Barak as saying: “We knew quite a bit about the informal, indirect contacts between the Americans and the Iranians . . . I was very concerned that the American tone was not sufficiently clear so as to bring the Iranians to a decision.” 

The tension between the United States and Israel reached its peak during a year-long period that ended with the 2012 presidential election, in which Obama won a second term. Netanyahu and Barak began to speak explicitly about the possibility of an attack and Barak presented his “zone of immunity” theory, which held that in less than a year, Iran would be able to protect the uranium enrichment facility in Fordow in such a way as to reduce damage from an Israeli assault.

The U.S. feared that Israel was trying to drag it into war. American newspapers quoted senior U.S. officials warning that they did not have the “full picture” of Israeli preparations for an assault and that there was no agreement with Israel that the latter would coordinate with the United States before bombing Iran. The Americans were particularly troubled by the possibility of an Iranian attack on American forces in the Middle East in revenge for an Israeli attack.

The Americans believed that Israel could evade their surveillance and present them with a fait accompli. Panetta told Sobelman that although the Americans had good enough sources to know whether Israel was planning such an attack, “a country as sophisticated as Israel could have found ways to effectively cover up that kind of possibility, because they know that we have those kinds of sources.”

 **2009 - 2021**

&#x200B;

In 2009 the United States Government made a deal with President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen requesting access to conduct operations against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The same group responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole, the attempted airline bombing on [Christmas Day over Detroit in 2009](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-sentenced-life-prison-attempted-bombing-flight-253-christmas-day), but more famously known for the massacre in France in response to the [Charlie Hebdo](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/14/europe/charlie-hebdo-france-attacks/) magazine attacks. AQAP was operating out of Southern Yemen at the time. In exchange, the Obama administration would [supply Saleh with weapons, money, and intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen/yemen-president-tackles-boosting-security-with-u-s-idUSTRE60116K20100102) to help fight against the AQAP.

[After support had arrived](https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/12/07/yemens-double-game-2/), President Saleh headed North with his new weapons, planning to attack his political rivals, the Zaidi Shi’ite Houthis. There are conflicting reports that the US Government knew this was President Saleh’s plan all along. Saleh had been using the supplies provided by the US Government to fight AQAP, but he also had been using them to fight his war in the North.

Unfortunately, Saleh’s war was not going as planned. Every time he attacked the Houthis, he lost. This failed military adventure had the exact opposite effect than intended. It allowed the Houthis to garner political and military power from their quick achievements throughout the North, making America’s allies in Yemen (Saleh) weaker.

The same thing was happening with the CIA’s drone war against AQAP in the South. Every time a drone strike was carried out, the [collateral damage](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/14/hidden-toll-of-us-drone-strikes-in-yemen-nearly-a-third-of-deaths-are-civilians-not-al-qaida/) was more significant than the number of dead jihadists—a reoccurring theme with Obama’s drone campaigns throughout the Middle East. With the increasing number of innocents killed, AQAP began to increase its numbers from the survivors of the drone strikes.

With enemies increasing in the North and South, the Americans were losing ground and influence. By 2011 Yemen became a big player in the [Arab Spring](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/arab_spring/Yemen), protesting American intervention within their Government. Saleh had been funded and armed yet ultimately failed not only in his wars to the North but his promised support fighting AQAP. At this point, Yemenis did not feel represented by their Government.

During the protests of the Arab Spring, President Saleh managed to hold onto power until he was injured in a second assassination attempt. A bombing that almost took his life. The Gulf Cooperation Council decided to remove President Saleh after his failures and months of protest. [Taking Saleh’s place](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-obama-idUSTRE7AM29B20111123) would be a new democratically elected President, his Vice President, Mansour Hadi. Who just so happened to be the only candidate on the ballot.

This election of a [single candidate](https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html) upset the Yemeni people. The only support realistically garnered by Hadi was from the Muslim Brotherhood group Al-Islah. After Saleh had recovered from his wounds, he decided that he wouldn’t be replaced so easily. It turned out that Saleh himself happened to be a Zaidi Shi’ite Houthi; with a large portion of his Army, joined his former enemies to the North, and [began a new war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-push-offensive-in-aden-killing-dozens-with-artillery-fire/2015/03/31/79f53d9e-d729-11e4-bf0b-f648b95a6488_story.html) against former Vice President and now current president President Hadi.

With most of the Yemeni Army underneath Saleh’s control, he began to march south, and by the end of 2014, he had [control of the capitol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0HH2BQ20140922). The Houthis had been successful and chased Hadi all the way South to the coastal city of Aden. The Wall Street Journal was now [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-citizen-held-hostage-in-yemen-released-by-houthi-rebels-1433178829) that the Obama administration had no problem with the Houthis and that if they wanted to help us fight AQAP, that was fine with them. The Obama administration started to provide the Houthis with intelligence to use against AQAP in January of 2015. Within two months, the Obama administration stabbed the Houthis in the back and decided to take the [Saudis and AQAP’s](https://www.fcnl.org/sites/default/files/documents/yemen_war_aiding_aqap_and_iran.pdf) side against the Houthis in operation Decisive Storm. 

The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-us.html) how the United States had shifted support from the Shi’ite Houthis to the Sunni Saudis and AQAP—giving the green light to the Saudis and providing intelligence, funding, and bombs. This war was launched without knowing what victory could look like in this region, and [US generals reported](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/17/us-generals-think-saudi-strikes-in-yemen-a-bad-idea.html) intervention ‘a bad idea’.

This new policy and backing of Saudi intervention in Yemen began a five-year-long siege on the people of Yemen. The US has provided [jets](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/middleeast/yemen-unrest/) and [naval support](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/20/politics/iran-united-states-warships-monitoring/), along with intelligence to the Saudis.

By 2017 Abdullah Saleh no longer had the support of the US or Saudi forces. He remained in command of the Houthi forces, who made up the majority of the Yemen military in the country. US foreign policy now backing the Saudi and AQAP, Saleh was becoming desperate. He had tried to make a secret deal with the Saudis by turning on his Houthi forces, and he was quickly [killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/former-yemen-president-saleh-killed-in-fresh-fighting) by his men just outside the countries capital days later.

Not much changed during the Trump administration. [The Saudis were unhappy about the JCPOA](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/10/11/why-the-saudis-would-cheer-the-de-certification-of-the-iran-deal/) deal made only a few years earlier, and Trump had decided to appease the Saudis even further by breaking the agreement with Iran. Not only was the JCPOA dead in the water but, the administration also continued Naval and Air support for the Saudi military. A deal was signed at the end of the Trump presidency to end the Saudi and AQAP support in Yemen. However, Pompeo did add the Houthis to the international terrorist list a week before leaving office. An important note is that they hadn’t been on this list the entire time during these interventions.

Biden, to his credit, has been trying to focus on ending all military support within this part of the Middle East. Next would be to begin flooding Yemen with as much humanitarian aid and supplies as possible. The unintended consequences of our foreign policy have led to thousands and possibly millions dead within the poorest country of the Middle East. The pattern of failed regime change and the eventual hotbed for anti-American sentiment in these countries is becoming history repeating itself.",geopolitics,Obama

Photo two: http://i.imgur.com/JNZjLSJ.jpg

These two photos were taken last week, in the prelude to the GCC Camp David summit.

Sitting on the left is Mohammed bin Salman, the new Minister of Defence and Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He's also Chairman of the newly established Supreme Economic Council, which is responsible for overseeing Saudi Arabia's shifting oil policy (see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/34j33x/saudi_arabias_oil_industry_just_changed/). He's the 30-something year old son of King Salman, seen as a rising star in Saudi Arabia and reportedly leading the military offensive in Yemen.

Sitting on the right is Mohammed bin Nayef, the new Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and a nephew of King Salman. He's been a key figure in security and intelligence over the years, reportedly taking over the Syria file after Bandar bin Sultan (Bandar Bush) was unceremoniously pushed out in 2014. His appointment as Crown Prince earlier this year meant that a fierce ally of the previous King (Faysal), former Crown Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, was sidelined. Muqrin was reportedly lining up Faysal's son, Mutaib bin Faysal, as the next Crown Prince once Faysal passed. So effectively the appointment of Mohammed bin Nayef is confirmation that King Salman has consolidated his grip on the Royal court.

Importantly, both Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin Nayef have their backs to a third guy, Adel al-Jubeir (the one standing/sitting in the back, wearing a grey thobe). He's the new Foreign Minister, and the first non-Royal to be so. He was chosen to replace Saud bin Faysal, a Royal and 40-year veteran of the Foreign Ministry. Adel al-Jubeir is touted in Washington as a hot shot, mainly because he's a familiar face and speaks fluent English. I see him more as a yes-man, especially because he's a non-Royal.

These photos say a lot about the new power dynamics in Saudi Arabia because they demonstrate how King Salman has consolidated his grip on the Royal court and is deploying his team to manage relations with the US and wider world. While his 30-year old son and loyal ally are leading the meeting with Obama, their backs are to the non-Royal Foreign Minister, which is a pretty big insult anywhere in the world, and particularly in the Middle East. It demonstrates that decisions are now being made directly from the King's quarter, which would never have happened under the previous King, who built his court around consensus and stability.",geopolitics,Obama

*Middle East is one of the most conflict-prone regions.*

The Arab Spring in Libya, which began in 2011, attracted the attention of the entire world community. Many began to wonder what the causes of the incident and what consequences it will lead. As it turned out, opinions were divided. There are three approaches to anti-regime speeches in the Middle East: recognition of the active participation of Americans in the events of the ""Arab Spring""; recognition as leading in the events of the ""Arab spring"" of internal political factors; recognition in the events of the ""Arab Spring"" of both domestic and foreign factors.

For many years, the Middle East has been one of those conflict-prone regions of the planet that has been attracting the attention of the entire world.

&#x200B;

*Opinions are divided*

The purpose of my article is to consider the assessments of experts from around the world regarding the role and place of the United States in the events of the Arab Spring. In my opinion, in expert circles there are three main approaches to this problem. The first is characteristic of politicians and researchers who believe that it was the United States that organized the “Arab Spring” - a new wave of “color revolutions”. At the same time, many of them are convinced that the Americans are implementing the theory of “controlled chaos” in the Middle East. The second approach unites those who deny the involvement of Americans in the events in the region, pointing to their internal causes. The third approach takes into account among the reasons for the events in the Arab world, both domestic and foreign policy factors.

&#x200B;

*The handiwork of Washington?*

Social protests that began in 2011 in a number of Arab countries and received the general name “Arab Spring” gave occasion to individual representatives of the world community to announce the next series of color revolutions planned in Washington aimed at establishing American domination in the Middle East region.

In their opinion, what happened in the Arab countries was not a spontaneous phenomenon, but a direct result of the external influence of the West, i.e. “Color revolutions”, adapted to the conditions of the Islamic society. At the same time, a number of scientists, considering the events of the “Arab spring”, are focusing on an attempt by Americans to put into practice the theory of “controlled chaos”.

Thus, the senior researcher of the French National Center for Scientific Research, Francois Burg, in his work ""The Anatomy of the Arab Spring"" indicated that it is important for the United States to establish control over the region in the context of economic competition with the PRC and the EU. One of the methods to achieve this goal is precisely the use of separatists and extremists to destabilize uncontrolled countries - the so-called controlled chaos.

&#x200B;

*""Arab Spring"" - a social protest*

In expert circles there are also many who are not inclined to view the events of the “Arab spring” as the next stage of the color revolutions in the world inspired by the West. Many researchers, on the contrary, are of the opinion that the ""spring"" took the United States by surprise, and they were forced to act on the situation. According to them, the reason for the spontaneous speeches were purely domestic political reasons due to the deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the Middle East.

From the point of view of Mimun Hillali, who is a research fellow at the Higher International Institute of Tourism in Tangier (Morocco), the US response to what is happening in the Arab world was quite quick and flexible. The Obama administration has tried to direct the processes that have begun in the right direction for themselves, beginning to interact with new political forces in the region.

Therefore, the “Arab Spring” began to be presented as the success of American politics, which carried the ideals and values ​​of liberalism and democracy to the Islamic world. He described his position in detail in his work “A Retrospective Analysis of the Causes and Effects of the Arab Spring”.

&#x200B;

*Causes of the Arab Spring, both internal and external*

Quite common in expert circles is the view that the causes of the ""Arab spring"" are both internal and external in nature.

The involvement of Americans in the events of the ""Arab Spring"" was noted in her work ""The United States and the Arab Spring"" by senior teacher at the University of Pennsylvania, Anna Raymond Viden. She stressed that along with internal factors, the external influence of Washington and a number of European countries that dreamed of democratizing the region led to a series of revolutions. But at the same time they had allied authoritarian regimes. Therefore, ideally, the United States would like reforms in the Arab countries “from above,” not revolutions “from below.” Evidence of this was the confusion of the Obama administration after the start of the “Arab Spring”.

&#x200B;

Thus, in general, experts were divided into three camps. However, it is not up to me to decide which of them is right. In general, the situation is such that in all approaches, the United States took an active part, which means that we pursued our own interests. Since then, the Arab Spring has passed not only in Libya, but also in the ranks of other countries in the Middle East. Notice that in all of these countries America was somehow mixed up. I do not think this is just a coincidence. What do you think is the reason for the Arab spring in the Middle Eastern countries?

Historically India has been a strong ally of Russia, although she was non-aligned in the Cold War.  But in the [1971 India-Pak War] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971), US (with Britain) and India were against each other supporting Pakistan and thanks to the Russian fleet the West didn't interfere further. Tensions didn't escalate then.


Lately U.S and India look like two buddies on the world's stage, what with Obama-Modi friendship. And interestingly Russia and Pakistan are somehow getting together.

But it is not so simple, is it? Particularly when another player which didn't participate in the 1971 war although it was victorious in the 1962 war with India is now the greatest threat to the USA.

Trump [threatens to decertify](Submission Statement: Trump threatens to decertify its closest ally in South America over its resurgence in cocaine production. A shocking message to Colombia and part of a series of events that has weakened the Colombian-US relationship since Trump has entered office. 

Colombia has been a fixture of the US strategy in Latin America and a stalwart ally in the war on drugs since the 1980s, receiving billions of dollars from US aid over the last two decades. Last year saw Colombia receiving $391 million in aid from the United States in its first year of the implementation of the peace agreement and was dependent on continued funds from the US for complete implementation. 

The deterioration of the once strong relationship comes after Trump [proposing the reduction](https://colombiareports.com/trump-proposes-cut-us-aid-colombia-lowest-level-32-years/) of funding to its lowest level in the last 32 years. That included cuts of 44% to the US Economic Support Fund and a 13% to the International Narcotics Control aid to Colombia, making the task of reducing cocaine flows north even more difficult. Worth noting that the President's budget proposal can be adjusted by Congress before signing. 

The increase in coca crops would no doubt increase even if the the cuts were not to happen. The coca production by hectare has seen a [sharp increase since 2012](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/colombia/article67788207.html); the same year the Colombian Government began peace process negotiation with the FARC and three year before [Santos halted](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/world/americas/colombia-halts-us-backed-spraying-of-illegal-coca-crops.html?mcubz=1) the 20 year long policy of fumigating coca crops in 2015 as a concession to the FARC during the negotiations and citing data showing it could cause cancer. 

The US has upped the pressure on Colombia ever since Trump entered office. Most recently Rex Tillerson and publicly called on the country to [resume aerial fumigation](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/us-calls-revive-colombia-coca-fumigation-could-damage-peace-process) despite the strong [arguments against its effectiveness](https://www.wola.org/analysis/coca-crop-increases-colombia-doesnt-need-fumigate-needs-something/). 

This latest threat is part of strong signal to the country that it will be pushing their interests above all else while simultaneously pulling away Colombia. The change in strategy is an abrupt shift from Obama-era policy. The previous administration[ pledged $450 million](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-colombia/obama-pledges-more-than-450-million-aid-to-help-colombia-peace-plan-idUSKCN0VD2XM) in aid. It seems likely an incredibly risky move to pull part of the funding to a country in the very early stage of a peace process ending five decades of conflict. 

Note: [Santos just responded](https://colombiareports.com/us-wants-colombia-return-aerial-fumigation-coca-ignored/) to Trump´s threat, saying “nobody has to threaten us to confront this challenge.”)

Stop Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait from funding them. They are their major donors.

Ban all Wahhabi schools in America and ask Europe to do the same. Stop Saudi Arabia funding extremist Madrassas in Pakistan. This will reduce future recruits for Islamic Extremists - be they ISIS or some other follow on group.

Even if you defeated ISIS militarily, some other Islamic Extremist group would spring up in it's place.
If you want to defeat ISIS, you should read how the SAS defeated Islamic Terrorists in Oman in the 1950's.

1. You have to take the local support base away. A guerrilla army cannot operate without local support.

2. You have to take their source of arms and funding away. See above that means getting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop supporting them.

3. You have to offer a better alternative than the one ISIS offers. That means as a first step to stop bombing people. Bombing ISIS is bound to kill innocent civilians as ""collateral damage"" which will just make things worse. It also means stopping the bombing of Pakistan and Yemen. The SAS in Oman took great pains to NOT to kill civilians. America kills far too many of them - it's a large part of the reason for ordinary people's support for ISIS.

4. You have to stop Turkey giving support to Islamic Extremist groups across the Northern border of Syria.

5. You have to stop Israel giving support to Al-Nusra (an affiliate of Al-Qaeda) across the Southern border of Syria.

6. Iraq
There will never be a military solution to ISIS, unless there is an acceptable political solution to Sunni's in Iraq. Iraq is an artificial country with Kurds in the North East, Sunni's in the middle and Shia's in the South. The sectarian hatred within Iraq is now so great after a decade and more of war, hostility, death, violence and poverty, that an inclusive political settlement is probably no longer possible. There will have to be a 3 State solution to Iraq to defeat ISIS. With the Kurds, the Sunni's and the Shia's all having their own country. For now ISIS should be contained in the Sunni dominated region that they now control in Iraq. They should be contained by the Kurds in the North West (as is already happening) and by the Shia militias, Iran and the Baghdad government in the South. A US bombing campaign will only strengthen ISIS support and serve to exacerbate the current crisis. Given time ISIS provincial government of the region will collapse from their lack of military progress, the lack of a unifying enemy to recruit further fighters, the difficulties of governing a large mostly poor, disparate group of people with numerous different tribal loyalties. Basic economics and human nature should be allowed to kill off ISIS. US bombs and bullets will have the opposite effect - as it has for the last 12 years.

7. Let Assad defeat ISIS and other Islamic Extremists in Syria.
Assad has the support base among the population in Syria that will allow ISIS to be defeated there, providing there is no interference or help to ISIS and other Islamic Extremist groups from neighboring countries (Turkey, Israel and Jordan - as there currently has. As well as stopping the money and arms supplied by the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait). The vast majority of Syrians are moderate Muslims and the last thing they want to see is Islamic Extremist Wahhabis and Salafis take over their country.

8. Withdraw American support for Israel.
Israeli war crimes such as the indiscriminate murdering of civilians in Gaza we have just witnessed and the constant Ethnic Cleansing and illegal settlement building in the West Bank is the other major source of recruitment for Islamic Extremists like ISIS and Al-Nusra.

9. Stop ISIS from selling their oil

A far simpler, less costly and much more effective measure than bombing people, would be to take steps to severely reduce the $2m+ a day of funding that ISIS is currently getting by selling it's oil production. But Congress are not voting on any measures like that.
ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day which it is selling at between $25 and $60 a barrel on the black market.
The crude is being transported in oil tanker trucks, mostly into Southern Turkey.
Presumably this is currently being done with the connivance (or even active collaboration) of the Turkish government.

We know that Kurdish oil is being loaded onto oil tankers at Ceyhan in Turkey from other reports.

What is congress and the media doing to investigate and prevent ISIS from selling their reported $2m+ a day of oil production?

Whoever is helping ISIS sell their oil, transporting it or buying it, is providing direct and material support for a designated terrorist organization.

A policing action in Southern Turkey to stop oil, weapons and fighters crossing the border with Syria, would be an effective counter measure to ISIS's current strength.

There are ongoing battles between the Kurds and ISIS to control the large oil refinery at Baiji and oil fields near the Kurdish border
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-iraq-crisis-oil-idUSKBN0GZ2BK20140904

Taking control of an industrial oil refinery would be a key strategic win for ISIS and should be prevented. If ISIS does manage to gain control of it, it should simply be blown up with a few bombs, preferably after warning the local population that bombs are about to be dropped to avoid civilian casualties. The Iraqi air force NOT the US should do this (there will be less blowback from an attack by Baghdad).

N.B. There are now reports of Obama bombing ""mobile"" small oil refineries that are capable of refining around 500 barrels of oil a day. This is a drop in the bucket - ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day and Obama is not hitting any of the oil fields. Most of ISIS's crude oil is being sold in Southern Turkey - see above. 

These are the ISIS refineries we're bombing. A drop in the bucket of ISIS oil revenues - around 1% http://mktplc.org/1wPv2tG

Why Obama's current strategy simply will not work and why he is lying to you

Both the FBI and CIA are against Obama's proposals to tackle ISIS because they won't work. Congress approved them anyway http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/httpclerk.html 

The Generals don't think that Obama's tactics are going to work either. They are now openly talking up the probability of a war against ISIS lasting another 20 years and so are Dem leaders:-

118,What's stopping China from reclaiming Taiwan right now?,19.0,5c81j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5c81j9/whats_stopping_china_from_reclaiming_taiwan_right/,35.0,1478787557.0,"Reclaiming Taiwan is perhaps China's highest geopolitical priority. Beijing views Taiwan as essential to the Communist Party's success, both for domestic reasons, and for projecting power across the region. Tsai Ing-Wen's election proves that time is Beijing's enemy. A unique Taiwanese identity grows with every passing year; the sooner Beijing reclaims Taiwan, the greater the chances of a successful reunification. 

I believe there is a significant chance for Chinese action against Taiwan soon, possibly even before President-Elect Trump takes office. Attempting reunification does not mean China needs to physically invade Taiwan. At least, not at first. Most likely is a [disarming strike](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1000/RR1051/RAND_RR1051.pdf) (cruise/ballistic missile bombardment) to militarily neuter Taiwan. Taiwanese radar stations, air defense systems, and other critical military infrastructure would be reduced to rubble with minimal warning. China would then pressure Taiwan to surrender, armed with the threat of further attacks. 

Who would come to Taiwan's defense? Obama is an outgoing President, unlikely to authorize war with China during his final weeks in office. Trump is a transitioning President-elect, still gathering his team, preparing for office, and *extremely* unlikely to fight China for an already crippled Taiwan. Economic repercussions are possible once Trump enters office, but China is [already facing those](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/trump-to-brand-china-currency-manipulator-treasury-veteran-says). The United States has never been more distracted, unprepared and unlikely to respond to Chinese aggression, and if the GOP continues the Pacific 'rebalance', China may never have such an opportunity again.

Of course US never liked Assad, since the 70s but it has been careful to not directly attack the regime forces outright. But as it exits- Russia and Turkey will increasingly end in more and more Quagmire. 

While Russia vastly outnumbered Turkey- in Syria and indeed Black Sea- Both nations are equal and powerful. As Turkey won’t have to consider US interest much going foward in Syria (hence the invasion)- neither does Russia feel the need to share information about its operation and regime force agenda to nations it deems “middle power” hence the recent attack. 

Both Turkey and Russia feel they are the bigger power in Syria and as the US exits- they will soon realize there is no one left to hold them back from behind- either diplomatically and politically. Turkey and Russia do not want to sever relations but because the power balance now is more or less the same- it is increasingly becoming like 1914- where Europe saw 5 states all almost equally powerful trying to see who was really at the top. 

Iran is still being checked by US sanctions and Turkey has enjoyed that to its benefits but that may change as US administration changes too. And Saudi War in Yemen is coming to a close- KSA will be able to field more resources to Lebanon and Syria.

The world is increasingly shaping up into 3 major economic power blocs.

The US
Major allies - UK, Israel

The EU

China, Russia
Allies - India, Brazil, South Africa, South America (excluding Columbia), most of SE Asia, most of Africa.

The US and the EU are rapidly declining in relative power, while China, SE Asia and the BRICs are rapidly growing.
This process will continue over the next 20+ years.
The leaders of the US and the EU have accelerated this process over the last 15 years and there are no signs of this slowing down, let alone changing.

Chart of Real projected GDP 2000 to 2030 http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/files/2011/04/image073-1-1.png

These estimates were produced in 2009 and dramatically under estimate the rate of decline of both the US and EU.
The EU currently has the worst economic policies in the entire world, closely followed by America.
America's share of global GDP was already down to 21.5% at the end of 2011. 

The fault lines of which of the smaller countries are allied with which major power bloc (and how strongly they are allied) will change gradually over time.  

This process will be much like the shifting of the tectonic plates in the Earth's crust, pressure will build up and then there will be a noticeable shift causing an earthquake. There will be small earthquakes and there will be some big ones. 

There has just been a minor earthquake in Ukraine. 
The nett result of the US engineered coup in Ukraine has been to drive Russia and China closer together faster and hasten the end of American hegemony.

Much larger earthquakes that will occur in the fairly near future are :- 

The bursting of China's current massive debt bubble 

The bursting of the West's massive financial asset and debt bubble (the largest the world has ever seen by far and already 20 times larger than the one in 2007). 

The alignment of OPEC countries
OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is currently aligned with the US but this will shift over time with the changing customer base for energy. 
The US is already energy neutral and is set to become a significant nett exporter with natural gas and fracking. 
The growth area for nett energy usage is China and SE Asia and countries within OPEC will gradually align themselves more with China.
The EU will become less important as an energy importer, due both to it's relative economic decline and to the exploitation of it's own large natural gas reserves from Fracking. 
There will be increasing tensions between the countries that make up OPEC as different countries move toward China at different rates. 
We have already seen an argument develop between Saudi Arabia and Qatar as competition within OPEC for energy export markets hots up. Previously Saudi Arabia and Qatar were 100% allied in their quest for regime change in Syria.

The alignment of Japan, Australia, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand
Pressure will build on these countries as their export markets shift from the US and/or the EU towards China and the rest of SE Asia.

Germany 
Germany is the lynchpin of the EU and is the only solvent country within the Eurozone (apart from tiny Finland). 
Europe will remain a major power bloc, with or without the EU. 
Germany's export driven economy has enjoyed an boom over the last decade because it's currency has been artificially devalued via the Euro and the Eurozone. 
Unlike the rest of the EU, Germany has low unemployment at 5% - the EU average is 12%. 
Germany is now negotiating it's own trade deals with China (which are in principle against the terms of the EU). 
Germany cannot look to the rest of the EU to increase it's exports, the rest of the EU is in dire economic trouble - it must look to growth areas and the only significant growth area is China and SE Asia. 
The German people are gradually rebelling against the prospect of Germany trying to bail out the rest of the Eurozone. (This is an impractical task, given that the rest of the Eurozone is 3 times larger than Germany and Germany struggled with integrating East Germany during the global economic boom of the 1990's and East Germany was only 10% of the size of West Germany.) 
Germany has asked for it's large gold reserves back from storage in the US and France. 
Merkel has been the most conciliatory (in the West) towards Russia over Ukraine. Germany is dependent on Russian energy supplies and there are no obvious alternatives. 

Africa 
Obama moved US troops into 30 more African countries in 2013. 
The US now has a military presence in 49 out of 54 African countries. 
China has signed natural resource deals with over half of Africa over the last 5 years. 

Conditions are now ripe for conflicts over Africa's natural resources to hot up - just as there was in the 20 years prior to WW1 between the major European powers. The main difference being that China is offering economic incentives to persuade African countries to their side, while the US is still using coercion, coups, bullets and bombs.

Military Power 
The US has seen the growing threat to it's hegemony from China. 
The Pentagon already has plans in place to surround China with military bases and fleets of stealth planes. The effectiveness of this strategy is extremely doubtful and it is extremely expensive, thus weakening the US even more economically. 
China meanwhile has already seen how easy it is for the Americans to be thwarted by guerrilla warfare in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. China will be seeking to embroil the US in a series of relatively small regional conflicts and will be seeking at all costs to avoid a direct military confrontation for as long as possible.
Given the very weak caliber of America's current leaders they are likely to continue playing straight into China's (and Russia's) hands for the foreseeable future, but a major confrontation will come about somewhere down the line.
The US government will not give up global hegemony without fighting for it, even if it is a lost cause. 
The coming conflict may be a hot or a cold war. 

The US Dollar as Global Reserve Currency
The US dollar will be replaced as the Global Reserve Currency at some point in the medium term. 
A loss of confidence in the dollar (and economic carnage in the US) will follow the bursting of the current massive financial asset bubble which has been engineered by the Federal Reserve private bank. 
The dollar will be replaced by a basket of currencies including Chinese Yuan and probably including Special Drawing Rights. 
China and Russia have already initiated numerous actions over the last 3 years to bring this about. 
http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/the-greatest-threat-to-us-national.html 

The latest of these are Chinese Renmimbi trading hubs in both London and Frankfurt announced late last week. Presumably the Chinese and Russians are accelerating their existing plans in response to the US engineered Coup D'Etat in Ukraine. 

US Politics 
The easiest and most effective way for the Chinese and Russians to strengthen their positions will be to bribe US politicians to adopt the policies they want the US to pursue, via dark money and front organizations. 
If they can continue to use this angle it will be far, far cheaper than conducting an arms race or fighting a war.
Other countries have already used this method to bribe US politicians to achieve their aims.
Citizens United and recent Supreme Court rulings have made this much easier to do.

The United States political system is currently experiencing a perfect storm of moneyed-interest corruption: wealthy groups and individuals are being allowed to donate virtually unlimited amounts of money to political candidates/groups while retaining anonymity from both the public and government watchdogs. This has been made possible by a loophole in the tax laws surrounding the 501(c)(4) status and a legion of faux-nonprofits have sprung up to launder the money of the elite, for use in the auction of US “democracy.”
In many ways, the United States has devolved into a plutocracy, with a powerful elite acting as the gatekeepers who decide which politicians are considered by the public. Because these elite interests give money to both sides of the mainstream political debate, they have bought influence over almost every politician in Federal office today.

America has already wasted over $6tn in fighting two utterly pointless and counter productive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and got nothing. American politicians are very easy to tempt into regional wars.
$6tn is equivalent to $60,000 for every American household or to put it another way, every American household is $60,000 poorer because of the counter productive war policies of their own government.

Time is on the side of the Chinese and Russians.
America is growing much weaker, due it's current economic policies which are wiping out it's middle class.
China and the BRICs are getting stronger.

See this for how this plays out over the next 20 to 50 years:

Some previous examples of Foreign Powers bribing US politicians :-

Some of the billions of US taxpayer dollars given to Israel every year in ""foreign aid"" is used to bribe US politicians to vote for more ""aid"" and to do Israel's bidding. The scale of Israel's overt bribery http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-scale-of-israeli-bribery-of-us.html This does not include how much dark money is used because it is very difficult to trace dark money funding. Nor does it count how much money is spent on other political lobbying to get US politicians to do Israel's bidding - e.g. by funding AIPAC, related political influence peddling groups and US media.

Other countries are catching on.

""Bandar Bush"" buys votes in Congress for war in Syria
Multiple intelligence sources in Washington, London, Beirut, and Paris claim that Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan has paid off key members of the U.S. Senate and House leadership, as well as key ministers of the French government, with ""incentive cash"" to support an American and French ""shock and awe"" military strike on not only Syria but Hezbollah positions in Lebanon.
Prior to the agreement on the last-minute Russian-U.S. “Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons” worked out between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State John Kerry in Geneva, Kerry ordered all U.S. diplomats out of Lebanon in preparation for a U.S. strike on targets mainly in south Beirut and south Lebanon. That move prompted Lebanese intelligence to examine Bandar’s lobbying activities in Washington and Paris.
Bandar was chiefly behind the shipment of weapons to Syrian rebels from arms caches seized by Islamist Salafist and Muslim Brotherhood guerrillas in Libya from Muammar Qaddafi's forces. That operation, which was botched by a series of circumstances, including the dissemination of an anti-Muslim video on YouTube and a failed covert operation conducted under the auspices of a classified President Finding signed by Barack Obama and implemented by then-National Security Adviser and current CIA director John Brennan, resulted in the September 12, 2012 attack on a Central Intelligence Agency annex in Benghazi. The attack resulted in the deaths of four U.S. government personnel, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.
Rival Libyan groups loyal to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, respectively, also contributed to the failure of the weapons buying operation in Benghazi. Pro-Saudi Salafists were upset that pro-Muslim Brotherhood rebels were reaping huge amounts of cash from Libyan weapons being shipped on Qatar Airways cargo flights from Benghazi to Turkey for later distribution to Syrian rebels. Afghanistan veterans of the Saudi-funded Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which battled Qaddafi's forces for a number of years and were members of Al Qaeda, got their revenge on Qatar and the CIA by attacking the U.S. ""diplomatic annex"" in Benghazi. The Obama administration launched a cover-up to keep secret the nature of the CIA's weapons transfer operation from Libya to Syria.

Bandar Bush's move to get America to start an overt outright war in Syria was only thwarted by the huge public outcry against it and the thousands of phone calls made by the public to Congressional offices.

The war in Syria has always been about rival gas pipelines, money and power (isn't it always?).
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have already spent over $6bn in funding & arming mostly Islamic Extremist groups fighting against Assad - bribery of US politicians is by far the cheaper option.

The easiest & cheapest way for China to take over global hegemony from the US is to bribe US politicians with dark money.
They have already started in a small way in a couple of State legislators.
The Chinese have bought a 50 sq mile area of land in Idaho and set up an ""economic development zone"" in it. In reality this is to facilitate more Chinese imports into the US.
The Chinese have set up a similar but much smaller ""economic development zone"" in Michigan.
The $5bn deal to buy America's largest pork producer has been approved.
The Chinese have purchased 3 small US retail banks to facilitate financial transactions between China & US. These banks also offer Yuan / Dollar currency exchange - something that is not otherwise easy to do for normal businesses & people.
China's medium term plan is to replace the US Dollar as the Global Reserve Currency, replace the IMF & World Bank for international loans and to replace the Federal Reserve as the primary arbiter of global monetary policy. 

With current US government policy it is only a question of time before it is widely recognized that the US has lost it's hegemony. With current policies that time is not that far away. Perhaps about 20 years. (It will take longer than 20 years for the new shape of the world to fully pan out - perhaps another 30.)",geopolitics,Obama

I was re-reading an [old piece](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin) by Seymour Hersh, regarding the Sarin chemical attacks in 2013,  and the following paragraphs may explain something:


>The Post report also provided the first indication of a **secret sensor system inside Syria, designed to provide early warning of any change in status of the regime’s chemical weapons arsenal.** The sensors are monitored by the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency that controls all US intelligence satellites in orbit. According to the Post summary, the NRO is also assigned ‘to extract data from sensors placed on the ground’ inside Syria. The former senior intelligence official, who had direct knowledge of the programme, told me that NRO sensors have been implanted near all known chemical warfare sites in Syria. They are designed to provide constant monitoring of the movement of chemical warheads stored by the military. But far more important, in terms of early warning, is the sensors’ ability to alert US and Israeli intelligence when warheads are being loaded with sarin. **(As a neighbouring country, Israel has always been on the alert for changes in the Syrian chemical arsenal, and works closely with American intelligence on early warnings.)** A chemical warhead, once loaded with sarin, has a shelf life of a few days or less – the nerve agent begins eroding the rocket almost immediately: it’s a use-it-or-lose-it mass killer. ‘The Syrian army doesn’t have three days to prepare for a chemical attack,’ the former senior intelligence official told me. ‘We created the sensor system for immediate reaction, like an air raid warning or a fire alarm. You can’t have a warning over three days because everyone involved would be dead. It is either right now or you’re history. You do not spend three days getting ready to fire nerve gas.’ The sensors detected no movement in the months and days before 21 August, the former official said. It is of course possible that sarin had been supplied to the Syrian army by other means, but the lack of warning meant that Washington was unable to monitor the events in Eastern Ghouta as they unfolded.

>The sensors had worked in the past, as the Syrian leadership knew all too well. **Last December the sensor system picked up signs of what seemed to be sarin production at a chemical weapons depot.** It was not immediately clear whether the Syrian army was simulating sarin production as part of an exercise (all militaries constantly carry out such exercises) or actually preparing an attack. **At the time, Obama publicly warned Syria that using sarin was ‘totally unacceptable’; a similar message was also passed by diplomatic means.** The event was later determined to be part of a series of exercises, according to the former senior intelligence official: ‘If what the sensors saw last December was so important that the president had to call and say, “Knock it off,” why didn’t the president issue the same warning three days before the gas attack in August?’

This is remarkably similar to what happened now. Contrary to popular assumption, the U.S. government has in fact previously publicly warned the Syrian government against launching a chemical attack, as mentioned above. The Trump administration's warning, therefore, is not groundbreaking. Furthermore, the sensor system mentioned is probably where the information comes from.

However, assuming the reports about this announcement not being coordinated with the DoD or intelligence community are true, it would indicate that Israel may have been the one to pass on this information. Bypassing the intelligence branches and directly passing on intelligence to the Presidential administration is known as stove-piping, something that was done before the ill-fated Iraq War was launched, and is also done by the Gulf States. Anyway, as the 2nd sentence bolded in the 1st paragraph mentions, Israel works with the U.S. on early warnings for chemical weapons in Syria. In this case, it's possible Israel has its own sensor system in Syria and passed on this information to the U.S. administration.

All this is mere speculation, of course, but if true, it would help explain this event.",geopolitics,Obama
132,"Is a war between Saudi Arabia, Israel vs Iran imminent?",15.0,k6l7o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/k6l7o7/is_a_war_between_saudi_arabia_israel_vs_iran/,47.0,1607089781.0,"Saudi Arabia and Israel have always talked about how the hated the ""Iran Nuclear Deal"" (JCPOA), so much so that Netanyahu came and addressed the US congress back in 2015 (all the Democrats walked out, and Republicans gave him standing ovations).  I honestly think the JCPOA was only done, because American and European businesses wanted to start trading in Iran---money rules everything. 

Israel and Saudi Arabia kept saying the deal made it EASIER for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.  The Obama administration brushed all these concerns off.  Then Trump came in and got the US out of the JCPOA and intensified sanctions on Iran.  He is basically doing everything Israel and Saudi Arabia wants plus more.

Now that Trump has ""officially"" lost (we have to see the official results---whether fraud was involved), Bibi/Crown Prince/Mike Pompeo are having secret meetings.

If I am Israel or Saudi Arabia, at this point you may have to consider war.  Biden has said he will go back into a ""deal"" with Iran IRRELEVANT of what Israel or Saudi Arabia have to say.  I feel like Israel, Saudi Arabia, (possibly even the US) will start a MASSIVE war in Iran within the next 30-40 days.

If this is done, then it would prevent Biden from going into any ""peace deal"" or the JCPOA with Iran and would FORCE Biden to support Israel and Saudi Arabia.  Imagine if Trump/CP MBS/Netanyahu launched a SUDDEN MASSIVE STRIKE into Iran?  Thousands die.  There will be no recourse from this.

This may be the only option in Saudi Arabia and Israel's mind, as a possible 4-8 years of Biden may be too risky for their National Security.  I think they will strike Iran and force Biden's hand.  They will do anything to prevent Biden from going back into the nuclear deal.

War is the ONLY option for Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Back under Obama, or looking at a prospective Hillary presidency, I thought there would be a chance that US interests could temporarily align with China against Russia, based on US actions in Ukraine, Syria etc and relative peace in the Pacific aside from the pivot to Asia. Maybe the reasoning was that a Sino-Russo partnership was dangerous, and that the weakest member (Russia) could be eliminated to remove that possibility. The DPRK acquiring nuclear weapons and ICBMs (and the necessity of assuming those two technologies can be combined) obviously was always going to be an issue for whoever ascended to the presidency, but I do think there's a chance that it could have been handled between China and the US while primarily blaming Russia for the crisis (this seems to have been the angle I've seen a lot of American liberals take).

Now, of course, everything is different, and I'm starting to think I was a bit naive to think there could have been any peace, however temporary, between the US and China against Russia.

All of the Americans I've spoken to about the rising tensions between America and China and the possibility of war have essentially resolved with the American being very, very certain (like, unwilling to consider the alternative) that China would never grow to economically, militarily, and scientifically outclass the US, and that if it appeared to be so or it appeared to be on its way that that was simply a sign of Chinese corruption/misreporting. The assumptions generally go that: 

1. China is not economically healthy and is certain to crash (and not recover) long before they're ever a threat to the US
2.  Chinese science is founded on corruption/IP theft/plagiarism and does not produce anything original of note (and certainly not enough to threaten US supremacy)
3. The Chinese military is disorganised, not modern, corrupt, concerned primarily with politics rather than warfighting, armed with poor quality Chinese materiel, and is essentially land-based and thus not of concern to the US.

So, putting aside these ""common sense"" responses to the possibility of China's rise, and assuming that China demonstrates them wrong or looks to be on the way (nominal GDP higher than the US, Chinese scientists or industry start to regularly achieve breakthroughs for the first time, and the Chinese military budget grows larger than the USA's and performs some action that challenges conventional assumptions about their efficacy or reach), will the US just peacefully let China pass them in capabilities, or will they continuously escalate the level of conflict and attempt to force a demand for, essentially, surrender? I think everyone here would agree that China is not going to surrender, and they're not going to give up the future they see as the most powerful nation on earth, so would that just mean war for some limited arena, maybe Taiwan and the Korean peninsula, with a cessation of hostilities before nukes are used?

As a side note, both parties have things to lose and gain from a conflict, but it definitely seems like China has much, much less to gain from a conflict right now. The longer they can put off confrontation, the better of a position they will be in if it does come. Pretty much the only thing I think China would stand to gain from victory (aside from subjugating a rival) is advanced technological expertise, IP, etc, and I think China gaining administrative control of Taiwan would achieve 90% of that benefit. I think in the event of a conflict the US mainland would be quite safe in that instance (aside from nuclear weapons) because China would have gained everything they wanted from the second island chain and would likely want to put a stop to hostilities to allow the Chinese economy to rebuild.

I would appreciate any reasoned thoughts.",geopolitics,Obama

When that's what administration-affiliated people are putting out there, you know expectations for the speech weren't high - and I have to say that I was not impressed. Besides the policy (restricting the second amendment for people on the basis of an opaque & non-judicial list, tougher visa screenings), the speech tried to share some specific  and appropriate messages, but all of them fell flat.

Yes - Muslims are in the armed forces. Introduce us to one. Yes, muslims suffer the most from terrorist attacks. Tell us about one. The speech, in seeking brevity, allowed its most important points to be one-liners devoid of memorable phrase or persuasive argument. Just statements: they fight for us, so we shouldn't hate them.

I don't know if I could have written a better speech, but I have to say I was disappointed.

---

**Rethinking Russia**: The main argument of your book is that the international factors played a key role in the Syrian civil war. What kind of factors are those?

**Christopher Phillips**: I make three main arguments about how those international factors both led to the escalation of the conflict and prolonged it. The main conclusion is that the international context that the Syrian uprising began in is the key to its transformation from a domestic uprising into a major civil war.

In 2011, the environment of the Middle East was really changing as the result of the 2003 Iraq war. The Iraq war unleashed a whole load of different unexpected forces that destabilised the region in different ways. It weakened the USA, which prior to that was dominant in the region. Then it attempted regime change in Iraq: it toppled the Saddam’s regime, but could not actually pacify the country. This outcome shifted the perceptions of US power inside and outside America. The Americans, as a result, were less interested in being involved in the Middle East in general. When Barack Obama came to power, he was very much of the opinion that George W. Bush had been wrong to get so involved in Iraq, and that he had the mandate to step back. From the very beginning, you have the USA not wanting to be as active in the region as they have been in the past.

In that vacuum you have all the other powers coming to the fore. There were the ambitious states like Qatar and Turkey, both of which in different ways benefitted from the political and economic consequences of the 2003 Iraqi war. Both states saw in Syria an opportunity to enhance their own positions. There were Iran and Saudi Arabia, who have been having a long-standing rivalry that goes back to the 1979 revolution, but until 2003 Iraq acted as some kind of a barrier between the two. With Saddam’s removal, Iran was allowed to expand its influence into Iraq and globally, and Saudi Arabia started to worry about this expansion. When the Syrian unrest exploded, Iran felt that if it lost Syria, it would lose all its recent gains, and Saudi Arabia felt that winning Syria over to its side was an important opportunity.

Then, of course, there was Russia that in 2003 saw a failure of the USA in Iraq, and began to see an opportunity in Syria. It has been sort of shy or maybe weak after the end of the Cold War, but as the 2000s progressed, it became more and more confident and willing to step forward. When unrest began in Syria – a traditional ally of Russia – it worried that if the US allies won in Syria, then Russia would lose another country to the USA in the Middle East. As time progressed, Moscow began to see an opportunity in Syria to take advantage of American weakness, and to show that Russia stands by its allies – unlike what the US has done in Syria.

This created a scenario in which these six external actors – Turkey, Qatar, Russia, USA, Saudi Arabia, and Iran – are not all looking at Syria with the alarms “there is a civil war here, we must try to stop it”, but rather are looking at an opportunity to enhance their own regional goals. This regional environment is crucial.

The second conclusion is that once the conflict is under way, the individual decisions made by these leaders played a major role in tipping the balance from a domestic uprising to a civil war. The external actors contributed to the violence of the civil war. In my book, I put a lot of emphasis on the role of the USA in fuelling the flames of war. It is odd that you have USA that is weaker and actually less interested in getting involved, but at the same time the language it uses is that of a hawk. Barack Obama called on Assad to stand down in August 2011, and the next year in August 2012 he said that if the regime used chemical weapons, that would be the red line. This language suggests that the USA is going to take on Assad and bomb this regime like Libya and Iraq.

**RR:** Especially considering that the English language offers excellent options like “Assad might want to consider stepping down”, rather than “Assad must step down”…

**CP:** Exactly, this is very charged rhetoric. What is interesting is that we know now from Barack Obama’s private interviews, and I have also interviewed some of the policy-makers from his Administration, that Obama never wanted to get involved in Syria, that he thought that the language would be enough, and that he did not plan to follow up. But no one communicated this to the Middle East.

**RR:** How is this possible that the Arab Street never actually got the message that the USA will not be getting involved, and some parts of it still continue to call on Washington for action, and shame Obama for the lack of it?

**CP:** In the Middle East there is a huge myth about the USA, that the USA is very powerful – just look at the weaponry it has deployed in Iraq and elsewhere, this country must be behind everything. This is what is feeding the conspiracy theories. And this is promoted by both US allies and US enemies. Iran and Syria say: “Look how powerful US is, and we stand up to them”. The Saudis and the Turks say: “Look how powerful the US is, and we are their allies”. When the leader of this country says that there is a red line for Assad, everyone thinks that he means it. And it came as a real shock to people that there was no help coming. Actually this played a major role in escalating the conflict, because the people were much more likely to take up arms since they thought that the USA was going to help them. I know based on the interviews that the US closest allies – Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar – told the members of the Syrian opposition that the intervention was coming and all they needed to do was to capture some territory and then the US would come. These countries were incentivizing the opposition to fight rather than to negotiate.

On the flipside you also get Russia and Iran reacting to this strong rhetoric of the United States. They do not know whether the US is bluffing or not, in the beginning they are not really sure on what to do about Assad as they do not really approve of him gunning people down in the streets. Iran sent advisors over to Damascus asking Assad to hold back, telling him that they support him but he should not kill people. When the US then says that Assad must go, the Russians and the Iranians then suddenly transform their view of the Syrian conflict, and see this as a regional conflict against the US. Standing by Assad becomes totemic. Assad cannot fall, because if he falls, then the US will win.

This is a story about the USA using hawkish rhetoric that it does not plan to act on, which plays a major role since it pushes everyone – inadvertently in many ways – to conflict.

The third point is that once the war is under way, there are two processes in the background that make the war more likely. There is the agency of the individual state leaders who, once the war begins, push the people more towards war, and once the war is under way in 2012-2013, all of the actors play a role in prolonging the conflict. They do this by doing what political scientists call “a balanced intervention”. Rather than one side intervening and giving one of the protagonists enough to win, multiple actors intervene. They send weapons, finances, in the case of Iran – troops, in the case of Russia in 2015 – planes, sending the support to each protagonist. They provide for each side enough to keep fighting, but not providing enough to win. This has happened on both sides. Pro-Assad states (Russia and Iran) have consistently provided for Assad more than the anti-Assad states provided to the opposition, but still they did not provide enough. Assad is still too weak to conquer the whole of Syria. It is not a complete stalemate because the conflict has ebbed and flowed, but the structure of the conflict is that no side can really win. The sides do not have enough resources to win, they have enough resources to continue fighting, and these resources are coming from the outside.

**RR:** But is it really fair to say that the American engagement was words only? What about supporting opposition groups, acting through allies, bombing ISIS, etc?

**CP:** The US has been involved on multiple levels. The big myth is that the US has not done anything in Syria. It has done a lot. When people complain about the USA not intervening, they mean that Washington did not send its air force or troops on the ground against Assad. What the USA has done, they sent the air force against ISIS in the east, and offered various levels of support to the opposition: political support to the political exiles and endorsing the elements of the armed opposition, since June 2013 or maybe earlier. The CIA has been involved in a program of arming some opposition fighters, definitely through Jordan, possibly through Turkey as well, and at one point there was also a separate Pentagon program arming a different set of rebels specifically against ISIS, and more recently they have been arming and supporting the Kurdish fighters through the Syrian Democratic Forces. However, by US standards, all this is quite modest. They were very concerned whom these weapons were going to, and they were also worried about the large prevalence of the jihadists within the opposition.

**RR:** How do you understand Russia’s Syria policy? How much importance do you give to the anti-ISIS fight in all this?

**CP:** Russia’s policy needs to be understood in two parts. Up until 2014, Russia’s view of Syria was mostly defensive. You could see it in the support given to Assad in the UN, financial support, and supplying some weaponry – and that was about it. Actually, at that time the leading ally of Assad was Iran, not Russia. As one Russian analyst told me, the key word was not Assad, it was “regime change”. Moscow wanted to prevent regime change in Damascus. There are genuine fears in Moscow and Tehran that if regime change gains momentum, they might be next. The intervention in the Ukraine shifted Putin’s perspective on Syria. I think it meant that he began to see opportunities vis-à-vis the United States. It was about increasing and improving Russia’s position. I was in Moscow just after the annexation of the Crimea, and I saw that it was a very popular action, even though it was followed by a round of sanctions. Putin wants to be on the world stage, he wants to be recognized as a world leader, he does not want to be seen as a pariah. He can sell to the Russians that he is standing up for the Russians in the post-Soviet space, but actually what he wants is to be able to go to the world events and be seen as an equal to the US President. That is why Syria was perceived by him and his policy makers as an opportunity. Intervening meant that there was a plan that Russia can go into Syria, and can then make itself a leading international actor on Syria. This would therefore necessitate the USA to resume communications with Russia because after the intervention, if you want to sort out the problems in Syria, you would now need to go to Moscow. That was a very conscious shift by Putin.

**RR:** Did it work?

**CP:** I will come back to it. This was his primary motivation, but there were others. We should not underestimate “the fight against ISIS” argument; I think it was Putin’s genuine concern on multiple levels. Russia has a history with violent jihadism. Let’s not forget the bombing in the airport Domodedovo in 2011, and people in the West tend to forget it. They assume that when Putin talks about the necessity to fight ISIS, that he is being cynical. But there is a genuine concern there and, of course there was a large flow of Russian Caucasian fighters going to Syria to fight.

However, experts say that if Putin is in this war to fight ISIS, why is he then attacking all sorts of groups that are fighting Assad, not only ISIS? I think that there is a degree of cynicism there, but I spoke to the Russian policymakers, and they told me that they see Assad as the defence against ISIS. They think that if Assad is defeated, and it does not matter whether by the moderate opposition or anyone else, eventually ISIS will be victorious. For the Russians, saving Assad and eliminating Assad’s enemies, no matter how moderate they are, actually is a way to fight ISIS. This is how I think it needs to be understood.

**RR:** Why do you think this connection does not get noticed? Should we blame the Russian army for not talking enough to the diplomats? Or is Russia talking, but no one is listening?

**CP:** Actually, what I noticed in my interviews was how well informed the Russian diplomats were about the Syrian situation. I did not speak to many Russian military figures, because when I was doing the interviews in Russia, its military intervention had not started yet. I was very conscious of how much they understood of what was going on inside Syria. They also understood very clearly the US position. Lavrov very early on understood that Obama’s administration does not want to get involved in the Middle East.

However, if I were to criticize the Russian foreign policy community, I think they slightly misjudged their understanding of the Syrian regime. They understood the geopolitics quite clearly, but there was this assumption which goes back to your question on whether it worked. There was an assumption that this war was a little thing, and if a major super power like Russia stepped in, it would be sorted out in six months. Russia misjudged how weak Assad’s military was. He oversold the state of his military to Moscow, who then realised that this is not a machine fit for fighting, but is held together with a sticky tape. Russia also misunderstood the level of Iranian penetration in the regime. Sometimes it is presented as if Russia and Iran are on the same page in Syria, they are not. They are allies of convenience, but they have very different priorities in Syria. If you look where they are located, the Iranians are interested in the route to Hezbollah, so they are focusing on the strip from Damascus airport, through southern Damascus, over the Qalamun Mountains into Lebanon. The Russians are based on the coastal side with a base in Tartus. Also their constituencies are very different. The Russians are focusing their energy on the Syrian military, and they are focusing on the Syrian Alawites and Christians. The Iranians are focusing on the non-military militia, on national defence forces who they helped build, and they are focusing on the very small Shia community. They both want to save Assad, but they are parallel to each other, and I think that this is one of the misunderstandings that the Russians made of Syria. They presumed that they will get to dictate the terms. But actually the Iranians have been spending three to four years deeply penetrating the regime, and the Russians had limited influence, because Assad has another patron whom he can turn to if the Russians push him in the wrong direction. There was a very interesting incident when another cease-fire of Aleppo broke three weeks ago, and the Russians were not the ones who broke it. It was the Syrians and the Iranians, and the Russians had to play catch-up. The fact that the Syrians have the audacity to do that shows that they are not simply in awe of the Russians, they are conscious that they can leverage Russian power with the Iranians, and the other way round. Paradoxically, this very weak dictator Assad has been able to suck in these two large powers to pursue his own agenda. My observation would be that I am not certain that the Russian military knows how to extricate itself from Syria if it does not get the result it desires.

However, I need to mention that the war in Syria is not that costly for Moscow. Officially, Russia has lost only 20 servicemen, which is of course terrible for their families, but it is the same number that Turkey has lost in a month and a half. In terms of money, the estimated cost is $4 million a day, but Russia’s military budget is $50 billion a year. Furthermore, after Russia showed its weaponry in Syria, it already signed about $7-8 billion of new arms contracts. So in a way, it is up financially. While most Western commentators are expecting a Russian quagmire in Syria, I think it will be hard for Russia to extricate itself, but it is not costing them enough at the moment to cause an unwanted exit.

**RR:** Could you, please, comment on the Russian-Turkish relations? There was a lot of tension, there was a terrible incident, sanctions, apologies – and now everything is back to normal. Is it?

**CP:** The Turkey-Russia situation is quite interesting. It is about an imbalance in regional power. Erdogan has a greatly inflated sense of Turkey’s importance and power. He felt that it would not hurt Turkey to send its militia into Syria or into Iraq to bully the Iraqi government, and when Russia entered Syria, it mistakenly applied the same approaches to Russia and very oddly shot down this Russian jet and killed the Russian fighter pilots. Erdogan was simply not used to a serious rival in the region and, of course, Russia responded very quickly and very harshly with economic sanctions. Turkey’s economy was already suffering, and cutting down the flow of Russian tourists was disastrous. Russia played hard ball with Turkey and forced it to retreat. Turkey has shifted its perspective on Syria: it is being less aggressively anti-Assad, it is prioritizing the conflict with ISIS, and it made amends with Russia by apologizing. Russia basically said “you must say you were wrong”, and Erdogan admitted it, and as a result the sanctions have been lifted. Turkey is now more coming in line with the Russian view than Russia coming in line with Turkey’s view.

What was interesting about this was that Russia absolutely used economic power here. It did not threaten Turkey with invasion; it simply said that Turkey needed Russia economically more than Russia needed Turkey.

**RR:** Do you think there was some build-up prior to the accident, related to Crimea? There were numerous protests in Turkey in favour of the rights of the Crimean Tatars – far more than anywhere else…

**CP:** This is all related to Erdogan’s desire to position himself outside of Turkey as a beacon for Muslim minorities – whether these are Turkmen in Syria or Tatars in Crimea or Bosniaks in Bosnia. He wants to present himself as a kind of hero. I am very cynical about his motives; I do not think he actually cares about these people; he is trying to play to a domestic audience. He was never going to do anything about the Tatars in Russia or Bosniaks in Bosnia, he just wants to present himself to his home base as a sort of powerful regional leader. And it cost him in Syria where he sent in his militia, which then radicalized, and now Turkey is being accused of facilitating the rise of ISIS by turning the blind eye on these groups going back and forth across the border. A lot of this came as a result of Erdogan’s personal viewpoint, rather than from Turkey’s strategic interests.

**RR:** Could you please describe the positions of the six countries involved in Syria at the moment? Where do they stand now, especially the USA with President Trump entering the White House?

**CP:** It is a war that nobody won. No one is in as better position than they were in January 2011. Everyone is worse off; it is just a matter of a degree. Broadly speaking, the states that wanted to topple Assad – the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey – are all in a weaker position. They all spent a huge amount of effort trying to get rid of Assad, and did not succeed. The USA looks weaker in the eyes of its allies. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey wanted Washington to take the lead against their enemy, but Obama decided that it was not in the US interest to do so. Obama thinks that he did the right thing for the US, even though it might have been the wrong thing for the Middle Eastern countries.

Now the US position will be determined by the actions of the new President. We do not know much about what Trump will be like in his foreign policy. We can use what he has said during the campaign, although distinguishing between campaign talk and what he might actually do when in office. If Trump’s campaign can be of any indication, he seems to be far more in favour of unilateralism rather than multilateralism. He does not seem to be in favour of any UN or NATO based solutions in Syria. Something that is going to be an alliance led campaign, like the one against ISIS, seems less likely. From that we can presume that he is not going to be likely to intervene against Assad. He has spoken against ISIS, so he will probably continue the campaign started by Obama. He has also spoken about his admiration for Vladimir Putin. There could be a deal put forward with regard to Syria and Russia, perhaps suggesting that America would end its support for the rebel forces and cede the Syria crisis for Putin to deal with, arguing perhaps that it is difficult for Russia to actually deal with it. He would be criticized for this brutal approach, but he is playing to the domestic audience, who have said repeatedly that they do not want to get involved in the Middle East anymore. But, of course, we do not know whether he will act upon the ideas expressed during the campaign or whether he will change them once confronted with the reality of the highest office.

As for the countries that supported Assad – Iran and Russia, they are not in a stronger position either. In January 2011 they both had an ally who controlled the entire territory of Syria, then a stable state. Now they are spending a lot of money trying to keep a small strip of land that allows them to say, “Look! Assad has not fallen, we have won.” But there is a huge area of ungoverned territory which is risky for both of them. And we still do not know who is going to win. Iran and Russia can declare a temporary increase in their regional position, but we still do not know whether it is sustainable. The only way to sustain it and claim victory is to walk out of Syria, but if they are going to stay there embedded in that country for 15-20 years, it might prove quite costly in the long run.

In this post I will do a review of Anthony Scaramucci's article [How President Trump is Breaking a Destructive Cycle in the Middle East](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-president-trump-is-breaking-a-destructive-cycle-in-the-middle-east) publish in the  Atlantic Council.  Of course people would be wondering why a person like Scaramucci would have anything to say about Syria, but I think his piece is interesting because of the following reasons 1) Unlike most defenders of Trump's policies he attack the foreign policy establishment / elites 2) Mentions the delicate balance faced by both Trump and Obama ,  disengaging from the Middle East while ensuring the stability of the region 3) Provides a global perspective.  its not best article out there, but it covers the key factors. After summarizing the article I will answer some questions 4 questions based on the articles I read about the Syrian withdrawal

1. WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?
2. WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?
3. WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?
4. WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

The problem with people when they look at Trump's foreign policy, they don't develop a framework or angle of attack, people get obsessed with his antics. In this post I am not so concerned about accuracy, but the framework. However, before beginning with the summary, I will provide two articles, one from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/trump-syria-withdrawal-us-troops) and the other [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/blog/trump-right-withdraw-syria), arguing about dubious legality of US intervention in Syria from an international law standpoint, but also that it wasn't authorized by Congress.  The problem with these article is they don't really provide a balanced geopolitical assessment why Trump made the decision he made.

# SUMMARY

Scaramucci starts off by referring to  Fred Greenstein book Th*e Hidden-Hand Presidency* that things are not exactly as they appear. The book was about the Presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, The Greenstein argues that beneath Eisenhower's placid exterior there was great political activity.

**OPINION:** I would argue that with Trump that despite the chaos. Trump has a worldview and Trump's foreign policy objective aren't too different from Obama's, only the tactics and methods used may vary, For the commentators about the withdrawal from Syria they might consider this in the realm of strategy in the Middle East, but to the US President in global scheme of US foreign policy it is just a tactic.

Scaramucci makes four points about US policy in the Middle East

1. Problems in the Middle East are intractable. The US has spent US $6 Trillion and 7000 Americans had died in Iraq and Afghanistan over a course of 17 years. Drain on American resources that could be better spent at home on infrastructure and education
2. Completer disengagement is not an option for the US, but the US can't be everywhere.  This is a dilemma faced by both Trump and Obama, and both have tried to find the balance.  While Scaramucci says that a number of troops are need to maintain stability he says  **However, largescale occupation without a clear exit strategy is a fool’s  errand. Since World War II we have shouldered the great burden of  securing peace and prosperity for the free world, but more than seventy  years later, if we do not receive more proportional help from our allies  this magnanimous approach will become unsustainable.**
3. He wonders if the the policies and interventions in the Middle East would be different if there was conscription or a draft.  Scaramucci mentions Eisenhower's speech about the Industrial Military complex.
4. As the US is bogged down in the Middle East, China is ramping up its foreign intervention, building artificial islands in the SCS and expanding its influence through the BRI.   **Hopefully China and the United States avoid falling into Thucydides  Trap, but if military confrontation does materialize, will we be  economically and strategically prepared for it? Trump is the first  American leader to confront China on trade. In the same vein, his policy  of engagement with Russia and North Korea is part of a strategy to  develop additional security in the region.**

Last, Scaramucci pleads   **As our democratically elected leader, he  deserves room to execute his alternative approach to foreign policy.**   

**OPINION:**  As Scaramucci has said about the Obama and Trump dilemma in the Middle East can be applied to their foreign policy.  There is more similarities between Obama and Trump's foreign policy than that of Obama and Clinton for example.[Both Obama and Trump felt that US traditional Western and East Asian allies weren't pulling their weight when it came to security](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-security-commentary-idUSKCN0Z72OW).  The difference was the tone, with Trump being much more vocal.  Outside engagements in the Middle East, since the Cold War., the amount the US spends on defense isn't a lot as a % of GDP, but that is only part of the argument. Even the Baltic states spend about 1% of their GDP and they are the most vulnerable.  Granted the US gains benefits from this arrangement, but its reasonable to ask the US allies to spend more. [Germany is so obsessed about budget surpluses, that its under funding its rail system, I can't imagine what the Bundeswehr looks like](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/why-german-trains-dont-run-on-time-any-more).

Both Trump and Obama wanted to pull out troops from the Middle East, and they were lambasted by the establishment for doing so. This is what Trump had to say about the Middle East

>[It’s very  important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we’re going to stay in  that part of the world. Now, are we going to stay in that part of the  world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a  reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/trump-israel-one-reason-for-u-s-troops-to-remain-in-middle-east-1.6697591)

. And for both Obama and Trump it was a key campaign promise. Obama has faced criticism for his pull out of prematurely pullout of Iraq in 2011, but Obama didn't anticipate the instability caused by the Arab Spring in late 2011. Moreover, much of the instability in the Middle East was caused by the Iraq invasion of 2003.  Right now, Trump is facing the similar criticism  regarding the pullout from Syria.

Both Trump and Obama have been accused of abandoning and alienating allies The right accused Obama of alienating [Saudi Arabia](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/barack-obama-has-nobody-to-blame-but-himself-for-alienating-saud/), Turkey, [Europe](https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/opinions/obama-europe-tisdall/index.html) and [Israel](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/12/obama-israel-kerry-allies/511796/), and appeasing Iran. Trump has been accused of alienating close allies like Canada, Japan and the Europeans.  One must understand, the system of alliance is a tool for the US, it isn't end in itself for maintaining US security and interest.  The US can afford to push around its core circle of allies, because frankly they aren't going anywhere.  It will take a lot for the likes of Canada to switch over to China/Russia, and so far outside of snubs and insults by both Obama and Trump, the US hasn't done a lot to disturb these relationship.  Trump has signed new trade agreement with [Canada and Mexico, as well as South Korea, which aren't much different from the previous agreements](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-nafta-gets-a-new-name-but-little-else-has-changed/).  This also applies to dependencies like Saudi Arabia and Israel. People were complaining how Obama ""mistreated"" Saudi Arabia and Israel, but the reality is who else are they going to turn too?  Trump's approach to authoritarian allies is different from Obama's, but I think in the grand scheme of things its more tactical.  US allies are like dogs, some are thoroughly domesticated, some semi-domesticated, some feral.  The ones you have to be careful are the semi-domesticated ones, a good example would be non-Western democracies and hybrid regimes like Philippines, Thailand and Turkey, Trump's decision to pull out of Syria benefited Turkey the most. And for a geopolitical viewpoint, which I will talk about in more depth later on, Turkey position in the Middle East in the long run is the strongest.    Disagreement with the West largely was centered around support of Syrian Kurds. The Kurds already have Iraqi Kurdistan, so its not a question of building a homeland for the Kurds. Furthermore, a Iraqi Kurdistan is faced with political divisions and flagging economy, despite the control of oil fields. How would a Syria Kurdistan look like ?  [Rex Tillerson tried to smooth things over with Turkey](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rex-tillerson-offers-olive-branch-after-turkey-warns-alliance-could-break-completely). The decision to abandon the Syrian Kurds and shift backing to Turkey was almost a year in the making.  Since the capture of Raqaa in October 2017, Trump has been asking about a withdrawal.

Both Obama and Trump objective is pivot to Asia to counter China, or go back to US strategic objectives prior to 9/11. Obama's Asia pivot which was announced in 2011 was weak because it was distracted by [Arab Spring in late 2011, and than Russian annexation of Crimea.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/asia-pivot-obamas-ticket-out-of-middle-east/)  The difference between Obama and Trump, is Trump is more single minded about China.  Most of the post here talked about the Syrian/Afghanistan troops withdrawals in isolation, without referring to [Xi Jinping's speech about commemorating 40 years of reform](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/181218022820736.html), charges against [two Chinese hackers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/20/tech/chinese-hacker-charges/index.html) and the rebuke of  state sponsored [Chinese commercial espionage by the US and her Western allies.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-21/australia-joins-condemnation-of-chinese-espionage/10645414) [In 2015, Xi and Obama had reached an agreement that there would be no state sponsored commercial spying, while the Chinese has reduced their activity in 2015 and 2016, once Trump came to office it wet back to normal.](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/us-china-reach-historic-agreement-economic-espionage/)  From a regional Middle Eastern lens, Trump's withdrawal in Syria and Afghanistan seems hasty and on the fly. This is where I differ from Scaramucci. If one looks at it from a global perspective, its not. Trump's is basically telling China ""You are our number one strategic concern""

# QUESTIONS

**WHY IS TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN PULLING OUT FROM SYRIA?**

* ISIS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, AND AS TRUMP SAID THE SYRIANS, TURKEY, IRAN AND RUSSIA CAN FINISH THEM OFF. THERE WILL BE NO VACUUM
* THE NARROW AIM OF DEFEATING ISIS HAD BEEN EXPANDING TO A PROXY WAR AGAINST IRAN AND RUSSIA, AIM OF SECURING PEACE WITH ASSAD, PROTECTING ISRAEL AND THE KURDS (MISSION CREEP)
* THE 2200 US TROOPS IN SYRIA MOSTLY USED FOR TRAINING. NOT ENOUGH TO FULLFIL FURTHER OBJECTIVES.
* IN 2011, THE US KNEW LITTLE ABOUT NE SYRIA. HAD NOT NATIONAL INTEREST

[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trumps-surprising-decision-withdraw-syria/578755/](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trumps-surprising-decision-withdraw-syria/578755/)

**WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PULLOUT?**

* ISIS MIGHT REGROUP AGAIN. *UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT RUSSIA, TURKEY, IRAN AND SYRIA WON'T ALLOW THEM*
* HANDS A VICTORY TO ASSAD AND PUTIN. *THE OBJECTIVE WASN'T OVERTHROWING ASSAD BUT DEFEATING ISIS.  ASSAD AND PUTIN HAVE SUPPOSEDLY WON. BUT ALL PUTIN AND ASSAD HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE A WEAKER POSITION THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE WAR.  IRAN IS MORE ENTRENCHED IN SYRIA, AND TURKEY WILL EVENT UALLY CONTROL MUCH OF NORTHERN SYRIA.*
* ABANDONING ALLIES -- *THE KURDS IN SYRIA. THE KURDS IN SYRIA WERE ALWAYS IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION. TRUMP'S CRITICS TALK ABOUT MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS AND ALLIES, BUT WERE WILLING TO THROW TURKEY, A NATO MEMBER, UNDER THE BUS WITH REGARDS TO TURKEY'S EXISTENTIAL ISSUE - THE KURDISH QUESTION. NATO ISN'T A INSTITUTION FOR DEMOCRACIES. PORTUGAL, GREECE AND TURKEY WEREN'T DEMOCRACIES WHEN THEY JOINED NATO.*
* THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HASTY, AND REMOVED ALL LEVERAGE AND INFLUENCE THE US HAD. US TROOPS REMAINING IN SYRIA WOULD SERVE AS A BARGAINING CHIP. *BUT GIVEN HOW AGREEMENTS ONLY LAST AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO EXERT INFLUENCE WAS THAT A REALISTIC ASSUMPTION*

**WHAT IS TRUMP'S END GAME IN SYRIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM OBAMA'S?**

Peter Zeihan, who wrote the book Accidental Superpower, is a controversial figure in geopolitics, talks about the end game in Syria / Middle East as being a US withdrawal from the Middle East. The question is what should the end state in Middle East look like? Should it be a local hegemon ensuring it remains stable and static, or should it be a balance of power, where all sides balance each other out.. Peter Zeihan isn't an expert on the Middle East, but he does raises interesting question. Obama opted for balance of power as Zeihan elaborates

>That left option two: establish a regional balance of power so the  region would self-regulate. This balance, ultimately, is what the  nuclear deal sought to achieve: partially rehabilitate Iran, partially  reintroduce it into the international system so that Iran could  counter — and be countered by — the other regional players. In doing  so — or so the theory goes — the region’s wars will be many, but  limited.The key selling point of the balance-of-power option  was that the Middle East has so many competing centers of power that no  single country would ever be able to gain a significant, long-term  advantage. That would keep any of the (many) expected battles bottled up  within the region. It sounds a bit cruel, but the ongoing civil wars in  Syria and Yemen are good examples of the balance-of-power strategy *working* because those conflicts keep the region’s powers at one another’s throats.

At the time of the writing, Trump had scarped the nuclear deal with Iran, and had no replacement.

>Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal does two things. First, it  wrecks the balance-of-power strategy by gutting the possibilities of the  region’s most active player: Iran. The resurrection of global financial  sanctions on Iran will — at a minimum — halve the country’s export  earnings by year’s end. This means the Americans will need a new  strategy for the region. At present, the Trump administration hasn’t  offered anything as to what that might be. But that is an issue for  another day.

At least with regards to Syria, I think a static equilibrium is emerging. The Russians have pulled outo f Northern Syria, and the Syrian government have told the Kurds

>[According to political sources in  Damascus, the Syrian Army will not come to the aid of the Kurdish  warriors but also will not join the Turks in their extermination. Rather,  they will stand by and watch, waiting to see who collapses first, the  Kurds or Erdogan. The policy resembles that of the Reagan  Administration, which stood by and watched the Iran-Iraq War of  1980-1988, hoping that it would either rid them of Khomeini or Saddam  Hussein.](http://www.atimes.com/article/damascus-to-stand-by-as-kurds-face-turkish-onslaught/)

Is Turkey going to be the local hegemon that he is referring too. Zeihan himself dismisses Turkey, while he argues Turkey does have the capability and unlike Iran or Russia, can pour troops into Syria to become the hegemon.  [Zeihan correctly raises the question whether the Turks want the ""crown"", given Trukey's continued interest in joining the EU](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-eu-full-membership-european-union-commitment-president-a8274166.html).  For Turkey the occupation of North Syrian is more to drive out the Kurdish militant groups and establish a buffer.  He also questions whether or not any local hegemon will have US interest at heart. [It appears that Trump has bought into Erdogan promise to wipe out ISIS](https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/turkey-biggest-winner-of-us-syria-withdrawal-1.61074777). While some have question Erdogan sincerity.

WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY?

MAN OF HIS WORD

First, **Trump is a man of his word** . While his actions are erratic, but what is consistent is his desire to keep his [big campaign promises.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/09/trump-iran-deal-lowry-218355) This is important with regards to foreign policy, because a US President faces far less constraints on foreign policy as he does on domestic policy.  It is like he has mental to do list seared into his brain.  Trump is relentless until the item is completed and done.

>[The list is long and growing. He pulled the United States out of the  Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate pact and the Iran nuclear  deal. He will move permanently the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He  has slashed the US company tax rates and stacked the judiciary with  qualified conservatives. He has put a “travel ban” that restricted entry  to America from several Muslim nations, which the Supreme Court upheld  this week. On July 16, Trump will broker detente with Vladimir Putin in  Helsinki.](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/like-it-or-not-trump-is-a-man-of-his-word-20180629-p4zoib.html)

Trump said he was going to draw down troops from the Middle East and Central Asia, and this is him keeping those promises.     I am going to provide you a list of [Trump's foreign policy promises](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) drawn [various sources.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/17/trump-foreign-policy-campaign-promises/93802880/) To be honest a lot of Trump's campaign promises aren't really original, previous mainstream candidates have made such promises before, but it was expected that people won't go through with it.  The difference with Trump, is that he does.

* Cancel global warming payments to the United Nations
* Renegotiate / Cancel the Iran deal
* Build a safe zone for Syrian refugees
* Move Embassy in Israel
* Close parts of the Internet where ISIS is
* Bring back waterboarding
* Develop a plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days
* Establish a commission on radical Islam
* Reverse Barack Obama's Cuba policy
* Cancel the Paris climate agreement
* Call for an international conference to defeat ISIS
* Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization
* Ask countries we protect to pay more for joint defense
* Suspend immigration from terror-prone places
* Stop TPP
* Renegotiate NAFTA
* Raise tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.
* Cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take undocumented immigrants back
* Build A Wall and have Mexico pay for it.
* Improve Relations with Moscow
* Defeating ISIS and Pulling out of Middle East
* Increase Defense Spending

When you break Trump campaign promises into a list, a lot of his promises are very minor and mundane, nothing particularly ambitious or earth shattering.  Secondly, he has fulfilled most of his campaign promises with regards to foreign policy that doesn't require Congressional approval. Thirdly, in a democracy, the major promises made during the campaign is the contract between voters and the candidate. If a candidate promises to build 5 bridges during the campaign, and later on when he is in office promises to build 10 because more money has been free up. If he ends up building 7 bridges, he hasn't broken his promise. Trump isn't a person who will go beyond his contract

# TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY AND THE COLD WAR

[This last section is more speculative, even though I will provide sources. To under Trump's foreign policy, you have to understand the last two decades of the Cold War It was in the 1980s, that Trump moved from being a New York celebrity to a national one.](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/400185-trumps-foreign-policy-rooted-in-nixon-reagan-principles)

What Trump is doing with the withdrawals from the Mideast, his failed attempted to appease the Russians, to gain leverage against China, in the way the Nixon/Carter/Reagan did with the Soviets by normalizing relations with China in the 1970s.  Even as the US was normalizing relations with China, China was still supporting insurgencies in Asia and North Vietnam. The chaos and human tragedy that had befallen on Indochina after fall of South Vietnam is many magnitudes greater than the chaos brought about by the Arab Spring and ISIS. From a strategic perspective by 1979, for both China and the US, it was horrible decisions, Vietnam had switched to the Soviets and had occupied Cambodia.  Obama and Trump are responsible adults compared to Nixon and Kissinger

To some historians the Cold War was just a continuation of the Second World War. The main areas of conflict were still Europe and Pacific, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Western Europe and East Asia are the only regions with the population, industrial capability and proximity to threaten the US. If India's position was reversed with China, India wouldn't be as threatening to the US, because of its location. It could have to fight through China, Southeast Asia, Japan and cross the Pacific  to get to the US. US overall strategy during the Cold War, particularly in Asia, was defensive, because it was the status quo power.

Trump would like to take the world back to the 1980s, before NAFTA (1994), EU (1993) and WTO (1995).  Trump like most conservatives don't have a problem with multilateral organizations, but ultimately believes that disputes should be settled diplomatically rather than through independent judicial bodies. That is the fundamental difference between the NAFTA and the Canadian-US Free Trade Agreement it replaced as well as the WTO and GATT. [Its why the US has been holding up  new appointments to the Appellate Body](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-trade-barbs-at-wto-amid-calls-for-reform/4703772.html)

181,US role in Yemen?,7.0,7437mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7437mq/us_role_in_yemen/,22.0,1507062903.0,"I have been following the Yemeni-Saudi war since it kicked off, but I have some questions on the full extent of US involvement. It will take a bit of background before I can get to the point, so bear with me. 

When Saudi Arabia and its allies launched Operation Decisive Storm in 2015, the US immediately offered full logistical and intelligence support to the coalition. During Operation Decisive Storm, dozens of war crimes were committed by the Saudi air force, including bombings of weddings, funerals, markets, and factories. Human rights organizations accused Saudi Arabia of intentionally targeting civilians.

Fast forward to 2016. A UN panel concluded that Saudi Arabia's attacks on civilians were systematic and in violation of international law, and requested an official inquiry. Later in the year, following intense scrutiny against the US and UK for ignoring Saudi war violations, both governments imposed light sanctions on weapons sales.

Finally we come to 2017. War crimes are still happening frequently. Trump overturned the sanctions on Saudi weapon sales imposed by Barack Obama. Just recently, a new revelation - [A US MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down by Houthis over Sana'a](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa/yemen-houthis-say-have-shot-down-u-s-surveillance-drone-state-news-agency-idUSKCN1C619H), the capital of Yemen and the location of most of the Saudi war crimes. 

Officially the US is only in Yemen to fight Al-Qaeda, but there is no Al-Qaeda presence in the  west of the country. Why would a 17 million dollar drone being flying over Sana'a, a city controlled by Houthis and bombarded daily by Saudi Arabia? This raises the same allegations that were being made in 2015, which is that US intelligence and Saudi war crimes are connected. 

I am not a conspiracy minded person, but  even I am having doubts about whether the US is truly as innocent as it claims to be in Yemen. We all know the US has a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia, which had its southern city of Najran occupied by Houthis. We also know that the US is very hostile towards Iran, which is funding Houthis as a proxy. It's safe to assume that the US would have an invested interest in ensuring a Saudi victory against Houthis. Would that go as far as coordinating bombings against civilians though? Given the history of the US and its poor track record on killing civilians, it honestly wouldn't surprise me. 

What do you guys think? Am I making too much of a leap here? ",geopolitics,Obama

The largely-Sunni opposition groups have mostly covert support from the US and other Arab states, but have fractured and partially metastasized into ISIS. Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia have stood firmly behind Bashar Al-Assad. Interestingly, Iran can now claim it's in their immediate self-interest after the rise of ISIS in Iraq. After the initial wave of defectors/deserters that formed the FSA and other 'moderate groups', it's clear from the viciousness of the fighting that nobody is backing down. The war of attrition may tactically be benefiting the regime, which has nothing against indiscriminate barrel bombings and even chemical weapons, more than it is helping the Syrian opposition. Foreign jihadis with their own goals are flowing in to support the Assad regime (Hezbollah) and against it (ISIS and others), and increase the risk of the conflict spilling over into other nations. The Kurds are doing what they've been doing in Iraq for a while: holding down their territory in the North with ceasefire agreements with the groups not actively contesting their holdings. As a humanitarian crisis, refugees are fleeing everywhere. It's agonizingly ironic for the thousands who tried to flee the violence in Iraq by going to Syria. The total death toll in Syria is approaching the Iraqi death toll since the 2003 US invasion. 

While it would have been impossible to know at the time, would an immediate action like a no-fly-zone, or maybe even targeted strikes against the Regime have worked to at least lessen the death toll? Would it have accelerated the momentum of the opposition? Or would it have been a political debacle (""Obama's bombing in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, AND Syria?""), or would Russia just accelerate its support for Assad?

No, I'm not asking about this because of some paper I'm writing. 

Feel free to assume that Russia went along with the UN Security Council as they did with Libya, or the US or NATO acting unilaterally (more likely).
