2,"Elon Musk shits on Corporate Media. Says he's wants to create botproof website where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication.",7616.0,8loa0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8loa0c/elon_musk_shits_on_corporate_media_says_hes_wants/,479.0,1527120893.0,"Elon Musk has been shitting on Corporate Media today, says he's going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464)


Pravda was a Russian broadsheet that used to be the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The word is Russian for ""Truth"" 

(James O'keefe also published a book called American Pravda this year, but idk if Musk is a Project Veritas fan or it's just a coincidence 

First this tweet:

[The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999355619390865408)

Leading to [this article on negative coverage of Tesla in the news](https://electrek.co/2018/05/23/tesla-tsla-rally-media-negativity-increasingly-immaterial-baird/), quoting a Baird auto analyst who says

>Negative headlines have increased substantially in the past month and, in our opinion, increasingly immaterial reports have dominated news cycles. We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment, and believe shares could appreciate significantly with execution, which should coincide with an improvement in sentiment.

A Verge reporter replies ""Musk continues his slow transformation into a media-baiting Trump figure screaming irrationally about fake news. Hope it works out for you dude!""

Musk responds, [Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999357298861486080)

[Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464)

What Musk is alluding to here is that because they pay for advertising, the News will cover nothing happening with these companies unless they have no choice because it's a massive scandal. Fossil fuels companies in particular have literally no other reason than this to advertise

[Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999369623484039168)

[Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999368393420488704)

Makes a poll:

[Create a media credibility rating site \(that also flags propaganda\)](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999374720368689153)

* Yes, this would be good

* No, media are awesome

Followed by:

[If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999389139551248384)

Wall Street Journal has already written [an article on it](http://archive.is/66HZ7) (not for or against though) noting that Musk says things like this often without following through, but adding that :

>One journalist retweeted Mr. Musk’s comments with a link to a California filing for a business incorporated last October called Pravda Corp., involving a person connected with other Musk ventures. [“Er, he’s not kidding,” wrote the journalist, Mark Harris.](https://archive.is/o/66HZ7/https://twitter.com/meharris/status/999372255237832704%20%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD?mod=article_inline)

The article also notes ""Mr. Musk’s proposal triggered criticism and praise, with some comparing his dislike of the media to that of President Donald Trump."" Guess that means elon musk is literally Hitler now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

5,"I really miss the Wild West of the internet: ICQ/MSN Messenger, Newgrounds, Message Boards, Counter-Strike, Starcraft, Limewire... even Mypsace. There was a brief window of time from around 1990-2010 where the nerds dominated the Internet before the elites could figure out what to do about it.",5400.0,ucis8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucis8v/i_really_miss_the_wild_west_of_the_internet/,777.0,1650996494.0,"...and that time was glorious. I'm sure those that were there can remember. The Internet used to be very much unregulated and back then, nothing had really monopolized the market the way things like Facebook, Youtube and Twitter do now. Everyone had their niche and freedom of speech DOMINATED everything on the World Wide Web.

The creation of Myspace was the climax... the final full breath of the Virtual Wild West. From around that time onward, things started to go downhill. Youtube came up on top as the best in the video upload market while Facebook started to dominate MySpace and basically became the new champion of social media by 2008. Twitter also emerged as an alternative way to socialize and it's clever niche got them in the game, too. And then there was... Reddit. Oh blessed be the original Reddit. How you have fallen.

While all of this was going on, the \*plateau\* effect from any peak experience (in this case, the Virtual Wild West), was still in effect the first few years of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Myspace, but by 2010 things started to noticeably shift as these (social/video) media platforms started to create virtual monopolies online.

It likely wasn't until the mid 2000's that the elites started to really figure out how all this internet stuff was working and what the best way to dominate it and control the narrative was. It wasn't that they didn't know how to psychologically mindfuck a population... they've been doing that for millennia, but it was more the fact that the internet itself is a very foreign language that unless you're raised on it, it takes a while to figure out. We don't think about this because most of us were young enough to pick it up as a natural language, but for elites past their fifties in the 1990's, it's a different story. They had to learn the damn LANGUAGE before they could truly understand how to dominate this new virtual territory.

In any case, I can't say I know all the details for sure, I can only say that it's quite apparent that, **A:** the elites were not in as much control of the internet as an expression of humanity as just super smart nerds were at first and **B:** social media and content creators being regulated wasn't really a thing until monopolized markets started to dominate the WWW, and that before these monopolies, the elites probably had no fucking clue how to get their claws deep into the underbelly of the internet.

Over the course of a short span of less than 15 years, the elites have successfully managed to turn one of the most wonderful playgrounds the world has ever seen into a propaganda machine, with fewer and fewer spaces of refuge. I'm actually shocked at how fast they managed to do it. I suspect unless we get a momentum shift and start going in another direction, it's only going to take another 5 years, tops, for things to get REALLY bad. Let's hope more and more people start waking up soon.

Maybe Elon Musk buying Twitter is freaking them out because of how easily Musk is going to be able to expose the fact they've been pulling the strings in the background all along. One can hope, but just in case, I won't hold my breath.

**TL;DR: Circle back to my title and then add: Things went downhill after 2010 thanks to the monopolization of social media. Before then, the elites had no way, or couldn't figure out how to be smarter and better than the nerds were online.**

*EDIT: I haven't forgotten about Google, though I failed to mention it in my OP. One company finally dominating the search market was a huge game changer for them, too. (And all of that happened around the same timeline progression.) The more Silicon Valley got its tentacles into Youtube and other companies, the more regulation and censorship we've seen because they are the current Gods of the search algorithm. They're basically playing the role of the technocratic Vatican at this point, and one could argue they already have more power than Vatican City.*",conspiracy,Musk

You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Musk

Subject: Some concerning news

June 17, 2018

11:57 p.m.

I was dismayed to learn this weekend about a Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations. This included making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.

The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad. His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. In light of these actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move.

However, there may be considerably more to this situation than meets the eye, so the investigation will continue in depth this week. We need to figure out if he was acting alone or with others at Tesla and if he was working with any outside organizations.

As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more. Then there are the oil & gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world — they don't love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power & electric cars. Don't want to blow your mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors. If they're willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they're willing to cheat in other ways?

Most of the time, when there is theft of goods, leaking of confidential information, dereliction of duty or outright sabotage, the reason really is something simple like wanting to get back at someone within the company or at the company as a whole. Occasionally, it is much more serious.

Please be extremely vigilant, particularly over the next few weeks as we ramp up the production rate to 5k/week. This is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us.

If you know of, see or suspect anything suspicious, please send a note to [email address removed for privacy] with as much info as possible. This can be done in your name, which will be kept confidential, or completely anonymously.

Looking forward to having a great week with you as we charge up the super exciting ramp to 5000 Model 3 cars per week!

Will follow this up with emails every few days describing the progress and challenges of the Model 3 ramp.

Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful,
Elon

>Psychosis is when people lose some contact with reality. Mass formation psychosis is when a large part of a society focuses its attention to a leader(s) or a series of events and their attention focuses on one small point or issue. Followers can be hypnotized and be led anywhere, regardless of data proving otherwise. A key aspect of the phenomena is that the people they identify as the leaders – the one’s that can solve the problem or issue alone – they will follow that leader(s) regardless of any new information or data. Furthermore, anybody who questions the leader’s narrative are attacked and disregarded.

>There are four key components needed for an environment to experience a mass formation psychosis: lack of social bonds or decoupling of societal connections, lack of sense-making (things don’t make sense), free-floating anxiety, and free-floating psychological discontent. Free-floating anxiety is a general sense of uneasiness that is not tied to any particular object or specific situation.

>When followers start to participate in a strategy to deal with the object of anxiety, new social bonds typically emerge and people change from a highly aversive negative mental state and isolation, to the exact opposite to the extremely high-level of connectedness that exists.
 
They went from : 

Trump hate > to hating anyone quetioning covid+masks+lockdowns > to anyone not taking the vaccine > to hating anyone not 100% supporting a proxy war in Ukraine > to hating on Elon Musk.

There are no mentions of Antarctica on Starlink's official website. In fact, if you Google ""Starlink Antarctica,"" you are met with several articles claiming Starlink will not be available in Antarctica.

**Why this feels conspiratory:**

Antarctica has often been the alleged geographic location of ""secret"" breakaway civilizations, entrances to the ""Hollow Earth,"" and even the final location of Hitler and high ranking Nazi officials who allegedly escaped Berlin during WWII. Not saying any of those claims have a shred of evidence to support them, but none the less, Antarctica has always been a unique, mysterious place for conspiracy theorists.

And Elon Musk just spent tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars giving a few thousand people better internet, for no apparent reason? It's interesting, to say the least.

**During the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #1609, at 100:45, the following exchange takes place:**

**Elon:** ""We have a lot of coverage around 53 degrees. Um, and then, we just started to launch some polar satellites, which will, uh go, have an orbit-like inclination, that allows them to kinda go... have visibility to the poles. Almost, ya know,""

**Joe:** ""Who the fuck is that for?""

**Elon:** (*pauses, looks away from Joe, takes a breath, and kinda tilts his head in an, ""I dunno"" submission.)*

**Joe:** ""Just in case? *laughs*

**Elon:** ""I mean, there's people that live up there, ya know?""

**Joe:** ""I guess there's a few.""

**Elon**: *As he takes a sip of whiskey and sorta grins,* ""Yeah. There's... Antarctic research stations.""

Unfortunately, I have no way to link the actual clip, as JRE is exclusively available for streaming on Spotify Mobile only. And no one else found this interesting enough to share to YouTube. But if you search JRE #1609 and fast forward to 100:45, you will see this awkward exchange.

Everything went crazy in America when Wikileaks released the Podesta emails and Assange was arrested.,1073.0,ufodcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ufodcn/julian_assange_did_nothing_wrong_wikileaks/,71.0,1651366306.0,"If only the collective societal outrage over Musk's pending acquisition of Twitter was directed at freeing Julian Assange. Wikileaks, in case any of us forgot, was the foundation of some of the best resources for conspiracy theories in the last 20 years. 

For a short time in the 2000s/2010s, Assange's work was supported even by the corporate oligopoly known as the entertainment (strickly for liability reasons surely) industry. Until certain files were leaked. Not going to lie, that era is a bit memory-holed. But Rolling Stone used to release decent investigative articles when Matt Taibi was the editor and ran articles on Wikileaks annually. Major magazines like Time and Newsweek likewise covered plenty of WikiLeaks content. 

Things changed around the Bradley Manning release. Bradley is now Chelsea Manning but was Bradly at the time of the leak. Someone associated with Wikileaks got arrested. Assange was holed up in Ecuador for years (while being spied on). From my recollection, Wikileaks publish content sent to them and did not illegally obtain the data. 

Assange was no longer in the news. John McAfee became a pirate and was accused of murder. The US got insanely polarized in 2015-2016. And the Podesta leaks were the last straw with Wikileaks and Assange (Pompeo and the CIA discussed assassinating Assange), News slowly morphed in to clickbait titles and blatant yellow journlaism. Everything from sports to sneakers to brands were politicized. Even if you were apolitical, you would be forced at some point to express a political view. Like buying a coke or wearing Nike was suddenly related to the two party system. 

Nobody filled the gap Wikileaks left. No other major journalist or whistleblower group popped up to take their place. The Snowden leak went over a lot of people's head considering the Patriot Act and CISA courts. It was nearly impossible to find a place to discuss these things, as they required lengthy exchanges and lots of sources. The media rarely covered what Snowden leaked. They absolutely covered his escape to Russia and various other Snowden things. But rarely the content of the leak. 

And that leak happened when most Americans had social media and devices impacted by the ""technology"" Snowden exposed. Basically, everyone with a smartphone or who goes on the internet was impacted by the fact the US gov had advanced spyware.

But no, it was all just Trump in the news. Couldn't discuss anything remotely political without someone making it about Trump. 

The grounds for Assange contesting extradition included arguing the US prison system violates the UN/Geneva Convention human rights standards. And complete crickets in the US despite the fact Assange's extradition case would support a position like no bail and BLM. Why wouldn't the US media want to expose how terrible US prison conditions war after the summer 2020? 

The simplicity of it is Assange published things that upset powerful people and they used their power to destroy and torture him. And that's wrong. He didn't publish lies or dangerous misinformation. He shared mostly government documents where the government actors incriminated themselves. So they are making an example of Assange to show everyone what happens to journalists if they anger the American government, While the US is lecturing everyone about human rights, Assange is rotting in prison because what he published embarrassed/threatened powerful people. That should never be a partisan issue. If a government is committing crimes, the truth needs to be told. Assange wouldn't have had to publish those documents if governments were honest with their citizens. Their lies caused the need to publish the truth. 

Lies are at the root of all evil. And like parasites, they die when they no longer have someone to attach themselves to. Had we rejected lies sooner, Wikileaks would not have needed to exist. If the governments of this world were honest with the people they are supposed to serve, there would be no incriminating leaks because they wouldn't exist. 

So we are all responsible for allowing the Leviathan of Lies to slowly chip away at every aspect of our societies. But once that is acknowledged and we no longer participate in lies, they will cease to exist.",conspiracy,Musk

You advocated to go down with the hammer & the fist on people who wanted medical freedom for their own bodies.

Tell me how you can turn around, and advocate medical freedom for women across the world, yet you clap like seals cheering on ""punishments"" and ""travel bans"" for guys like me who wanted MY medical freedom.

All I wanted was to decide what goes in my own body. I never wanted to ""consequence"" anyone for not taking a drug. I never wanted to ""punish"" anyone for any reason for what they do with their body.

But we have people (and it might be you reading this) who want to ostracize people who don't take a vaccine, yet soften their hearts on women who abort their unborn children (for whatever reason).

Why can't we all agree that BODILY AUTONOMY is universal. It's sacred, and NOBODY (absolutely nobody) should have to take a drug to unlock ""privileges"" in a civilized society. At the same time, a child is part of a woman at one point, a woman's body is where the magic happens, and that body is not to be interfered with by anyone other than her.

I believe this.

But after seeing the double standards and the general sentiment of *women can do what they want with their bodies, but hunt down the unvaccinated and punish them* because ""choices have consequences""…I'm not sure if some of you really believe in **bodily autonomy**.

It makes you look disingenuous, what are you REALLY hiding?

120,"The Chinese and American elite are not enemies. It’s all a show. America, like China, have the same goals. Both have intergenerational elites. Both are used to ruling, both wield immense power, both plan to keep that power. Their common enemy is not each other, their enemy is us.",496.0,iis0vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iis0vw/the_chinese_and_american_elite_are_not_enemies/,65.0,1598706191.0,"The “grand chessboard” is the world. We are the pawns. China and America pretend to be on opposite sides but, don’t worry, it’s just a game. 

If they make a wrong move their pawn dies, not them. They both live to play another friendly game. And, like democrats and republicans, they will join forces and attack whoever dares to threaten their game. 

Chinese and American elites both have the same goal - to be masters of the universe. Literally. But they won’t reach this goal for hundreds of years. Their goal of being gods on earth, however, is close to coming true.

This instinct - to be the alpha - has been with us since homo habilis walked the earth 2.8 million years ago. 

However, in sociopaths and psychopaths the determination to be the “alpha” is incredibly strong. And we know sociopaths are over represented in elite circles. So, the elite embrace a “dog eat dog” mentality. While being outwardly charming they hate you because they “know” you are inferior to them.  Sound familiar?

Sociopathy has many societal advantages if you don’t mind not having a conscience. Sociopaths make great surgeons because they can make “rational” decisions “unclouded” by emotion. (Notice how even our language is pro-sociopath. Being emotional doesn’t mean you care, it means you are irrational).

So, to summarise - in capitalism or communism power and wealth is likely to be in the hands of sociopaths. Sociopathy is genetic and is enhanced by socialisation with other sociopaths.

Power and wealth leads to a mindset that strides decades and even centuries. They are obsessed with keeping their wealth and power. Keeping their genetic superiority alive.

Sociopathy in intergenerational families is common. Their children regularly “fight” each other to take over from the alpha. (Murdoch, Rothschild, Trump etc). They prove themselves by how much they can exploit people. 

This is why they just never give their money away. We all ask why hasn’t Bill Gates or Bezos given some of it to help the poor?

Answer? They see the poor as subhuman. It’s nothing personal. Sociopaths see everyone but themselves as pray. Why waste money on genetic failures? (I don’t believe this, just trying to give you my take on how they think). 

Instead, they would not help them, they would exploit them. It’s the rational thing to do if you are selfish, feel superior, love playing mind games and cannot feel guilt. 

So, to the sociopathic elite in China and America they choose to exploit the people for money? Why not experiment on them too? They are really only farm animals to be tagged (see Elon Musk’s Neuralink). Just meat bags for Beta testing.

The elite’s values and beliefs are the same as fundamentalists in all religions:

-	The Earth is theirs and sub-humans are killing it.  
-	The enlightened elite will inherit the Earth (but first they must save it)


Their methods are:

-	Thin the herd - kill the poor because they are genetically inferior. 

-	Enhance my own genetic superiority through crispr and gene splicing. They want to look as superior as they feel. 

-	Embrace science not for social good but for personal benefit and profit.

Remember, the acquisition and use of power isn’t a method to them. It’s the whole point. The end goal is to hold on to that power forever. (If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever. - George Orwell).

Once the elites achieve genetic perfection and make AI their slave they might look like gods to a new generation that knows no different.

Once AI is their slave they don’t need billions of humans to make things and invent things. They can kill off these stupid vermin. 

Perhaps the Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, will get his wish to come back as a deadly virus to kill half the worlds population. 

But right now, the elite are scared of us. They know that if billions of people woke up, no army on earth could save them. So, once they have drones, nuclear bombs and AI, they will
neither need us or want us. 

Killing billions will create a manageable population of surfs to do their bidding. After all, a god is only a god if there are people to worship him. 

One current example of elites in America and China working as one:

-	Covid-19. Both elites have the same goals for their countries and the world - a dystopian panopticon. They need to control the masses that they fear so much.

This pandemic helps them reach their goal. It’s a move as important as a world war. Notice how China is back to normal. It would be because the pandemic needs to strip Americans of their rights. 

In China the pandemic can be allowed to vanish because they don’t have any rights to start with. China’s only task was to demonstrate to the people of the world that authoritarianism “saved” people from an awful plague. How noble authoritarianism must be. /s

Another example:

-	Globalisation. No normal human would export all America jobs to China. But someone with no conscience, who would benefit financially would. It’s a win/win. It enriches them and makes the people weak and exploitable.


But why allow China to get rich? They have common interests - China and America both have something each other need. 

China has mastered authoritarian dystopia because human rights and democracy were never embedded in Chinese society as they are in America.  Chinese authoritarianism, would be a great prize to American elites.

China needs technological know-how and financial credibility. In China, break through innovation is rare. America is good at this. China is amazing at innovating an existing invention but totally new technological paradigm - like electricity, rockets, GPS, Crispr etc etc - is America’s finest asset. And stealing it only gets them so far. They are always on the back foot.


America has technological, scientific, military and financial superiority - for now.  But the elites in America look upon enviously at how well China has control of its masses. They want that. And they will use the “threat” of China to get it.

It’s a perfect match.


**The human rights you “enjoy” now in the West are to be destroyed.**

As an aside, when did we start using the word “enjoy” in relation to our human rights? Like it’s something that has been given to us. Rather than something we are born with. They are our inalienable rights, right? Don’t worry about all that. As George W Bush said - the Constitution is “just a piece of paper.”

But, you say, I have human rights now. America is not like China. You’re right, at the moment it isn’t. But you aren’t getting more free. You aren’t getting more rights, you aren’t getting richer or healthier. 

Property rights etc have already been undermined. And, via the billy club of Climate Change, more rights will be stripped away. 


Any human rights and social benefits we enjoy today have been inherited. Any human right we have been given, that involved the sharing of power with the elite, has been given to us when non-sociopaths gain power. This doesn’t last long and the sociopaths then spend the following years slowly taking those rights away. 

Don’t mistake recent new “rights” as being the same as fundamental rights like free speech (which is on life support) or Habeas Corpus (unless you are in a Black site like Guantánamo).

A recent new “right” would be the right for gay people to marry. I am gay and I welcome it but it involves no relinquishing of power by the elite. In that sense it isn’t a right at all. It actually benefited the elite and that’s why they did it/allowed it to be done. It helps reduce the population and it divides America a bit more.

So, is there a man behind the curtain pulling all the strings? 

No. Its more clever than that. It’s cultural. It’s genetic. It’s just how they are. Leave a puppy in the middle of an island all by itself and he will grow up and act like a dog despite never seeing one. And, if he saw a dog, he would recognise they were the same. He would make friends with the new dog. The dogs have names. One is called America. The other Is China. And we are their lunch.

But, hey, don’t worry. “Change is gonna come.” Just one more election. One more vote for Hope. One more vote to “make America great again.” 

Notice how no political party has ever said to the voter - you need to riot. This place is corrupt. Burn it down and we’ll start again. 

Trump tried this after 2016 but then “Q” arrived and said “not yet. Just wait. One more week. One more month. One more term and then he’ll really help you. Trust us. Who else have you got? What the hell have you got to lose?” 

I’m sure Biden is different. The latest “change” candidate would never never be caught on a hot mic telling his donors that “nothing would fundamentally change.” /s

https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/

Finally, don’t beat yourself up about this. It’s not our fault. We were born into it. We don’t know what life was like “before.” And that is also deliberate. 

Remember “the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world” and today that hand is Disney and Amazon. 

The media. Disney etc, controls what we value. Consumerism and marketing depends on the ability to shape our opinions so well that it results in us buying that iPhone or whatever. 

So, if we could  identify what we don’t value. If we could identify what we’ve been implicitly taught not to value we’d discover what truly had value. Right? So what could that be. This is my personal list:

History

-	We are trained to ignore history. To not read it in any detail. Even if we do read it it’s always a modern take on history. We rarely read the original text of powerful people and when we do it is tame things like Shakespeare. 
-	The reason history is not valued is it reveals the elite’s game.  It’s like a powerful time machine and, with a time machine you can see patterns over time. Who keeps winning, who keeps losing etc. If you look hard enough and are persistent nothing is hidden from you. That scares them.
-	History is like a treasure chest. It gives you all the best writing by non-sociopaths, people who worked for the benefit of all. These must have been remarkable people to win against incredible odds. Their writing has power. Their thoughts are ones the elite want to make illegal. Please just forget you have rights. 
-	And if do know their names - MLK for example - it will trigger boredom. School lessons and drab books and perhaps a few words from him. But it will he edited. Did you know MLK was not for peaceful protests if they were shown not to work? He had a whole philosophy of achieving fairness and equality for the people through economc justice (I expect a few of you reading this have been trained to flinch at the word “equality”. As I said, the elite are clever).  
-	MLK is now used by the elite to keep black people “in line.”  The elite use him as a totem. Whenever black people are just exhausted at the injustice and some protest or even riot. MLK is rolled out. But they dont roll out the MLK that justified violence if non-viollence didnt work. 
-	Real history. Unedited history.  Cannot he found easily. You must search for dusty first person accounts, old and hard to find books and dig into niche old newspapers. 
-	Researching this way is the mental equivalent of letting off a nuclear bomb. Over time it reveals their old plans because you can finally see beyond your nose and what you see and read is something real. You’ll know it when you see it. Hell, you’ll feel it. 
-	Your horizon lifts. You are no longer strapped to the front of a speeding truck with “breaking news” and “content” hitting you like hundreds of files. 
-	With the power of history you find yourself sharing the vantage point of the elite. You can trace daily decisions over time and see what their result truly is. You can see patterns of behaviour of action and inaction which culminate in a vaguely familiar story from history but what you’ve read - how history became history - will be radically different  from what you’ve been taught. But more likely you are not taught anything about it. You didn’t miss what you never had.

Check you MLK’s speech on economic justice here: https://youtu.be/dOWDtDUKz-U

In one area or another we are all the boiling frog. In one area or topic we are determined to delude ourselves rather than admit to having been duped by others.  We like the warmth of self-deception too much in the slow burning pot to let ourselves realise it’s killing us. 


As an aside, wouldn’t it be great for the elite if someone started a protest which told everyone if they read the works of great men of history they would be a racist? Perhaps we should even take down their statues so there aren’t these giant reminders around all these plebs? 

I am not defending racists here. I think we can condemn a historical figure’s racism  while at the same time appreciating the non-racist messages and great works of art they created. It’s odd how we must destroy the evidence of racist historical figures (who mainly wrote about human rights) but we’re supposed to pretend the two current presidential candidates have never said racist things themselves.

Other things on my list which we are meant to not value: 

-	Motherhood
-	Fatherhood  
-	Family - not just immediate but your extended family too 
-	Community 
-	Living independently with nature


I’ll stop there. My fingers are getting sore and I’m starting to ramble.

Depopulation, Revolution, or Mass Overhaul are our options.",493.0,prmvbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/prmvbr/hey_conspiracy_friends_weve_hit_a_societal/,124.0,1632109053.0,"
WARNING: This is a long, LONG Post. It may be one of the most important posts on this sub in awhile because it’s true, spoken from the heart, and coming from a place of immense worry and thoughtfulness. If you don’t have the time to read, please skip this post to another. 

First, thank you all for taking the time to read this. I will cut right to the chase, but I want to warn the shills/bots, this post is not for you. I seldom have time to interact with NPCs, much the less the desire to.

So let’s proceed. Australia has fallen. Canada is in the midst of falling. Europe is looking bleak. There are mass protests all over the globe. Awareness is growing faster than censorship can keep up with. 

We are at a crossroads in our society. We are at the point of no return. The globalists, the Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission, The World Economic Forum, The United Nations,  The Gates Foundation, The Elites; whatever you want to call them or label them as, have gone all in. (At this point if you don’t recognize some of these groups, it is essential to understanding them.) 

If you deny this much, stop reading here. This post is too much for you and you have much homework to do if you believe our leaders of any party, three letter agency, or politicians give a single shit about you. They don’t. Go back to your safe space because this post is about reality.

The teeter totter hypothesis proposes that society happens in cycles, and eventually when a cycle is made, there can only be one outcome, the question is, how do we decide the outcome?

We must weigh our options carefully to keep the teeter totter balanced. But eventually societies and nations collapse. Even the great ones. Sumerians fell. Egyptians fell. Greeks fell. The Romans fell. The Aztecs fell. The Mayans fell. Germany fell. The USSR fell. 

A myriad of cultures, languages, political systems, capital systems, ideologies, races, all fell in due time. It is the way of life, but time marches forward, and like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, man also lifts himself up after the worst of tragedies, wars, and famine.

The United States is currently that society falling. I realize Reddit is much bigger than America, but the brutal truth, despite the massive disinformation campaign globally to make America seem inept after years of Trump, is that we are the leading hub of the world. I’m just about every metric. We are the leading cultural hub of the world. We are the largest consumers. We produce entertainment through Hollywood and music. We have the most public companies. New York City is the center of finance in the world. Silicon Valley is the center of technological progress. We have the largest military in the world. 

And yet, we have failed.

America has failed. Some have connected the dots and realized this, some haven’t, some still believe in their futile attempts to resurrect a nation that time has passed by. To my next point, again I reiterate, if you believe any democratic or Republican politician, Biden, Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, AOC, etc. is going to save you, stop reading. You have much homework to do. We are entirely past that. No three letter agency or institution is going to come to your rescue.

We have been domesticated as a species to accept our mundane way of life the past 6 decades. You go to school to get a job to pay your taxes to have children and continue the cycle. You hopefully enjoy a hobby or two, a musical instrument, play a sport, read some books, and then you die. 

We have lost all spiritual and religious connection. The almighty dollar and the rat race to the bottom fuels all. Communism doesn’t work, and capitalism is the best we have. Rules for thee, but not for me. There is no middle class. That’s a myth. There’s only those with capital, the poor, and the less poor. Humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth. The difference between 100k and 1 million, isn’t all that different than 1 million and 1 billion to the average mind who considers these numbers an after thought. The fact that the top tax brackets ends at 400k and upward is a travesty when one considers the wealth of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.

The ‘leaders’, whether elected or not (looking at you Klaus Schwab), have planted their flags into the ground and made their global stance known. In order to form a global government, a government of a global people with a common goal and ideology, nationalism, capitalism, borders, and pride in your nation must be eradicated and driven out. 

No matter your views on origin, treatment, or the real facts of Covid, one thing is certain. The elite class has taken advantage of the opportunities at every turn. If you cannot see the writing on the wall, again, please stop reading. Go to another sub. This is the conspiracy sub, not CNN or WorldNews. There they will coddle you and reinforce the sheep narrative of confirmation bias with a revolving door echo chamber.

The grim reality is that society is a carefully crafted illusion that is a house of cards. If businesses stopped worldwide even for a day, the system collapses. If the world currency exchange quit relying on the US Dollar and Federal Reserve, the world collapses. We are mere moments at any given time from complete anarchy. This is why these elites, no matter how high they perceive themselves in a world of lesser people, have to be kept somewhat in check. Mass societies turning on their politicians (public servants) is all it takes for a complete revolution.

They have to keep things balanced to maintain order and the illusion of a society that knows no bounds and life is just peachy. 

Now with AI and tech surpassing prior levels of understanding at a rapid pace, the world is changing. Soon there will be no need for police officers. Robotic entities will replace them. Every cashier will be replaced. Every mundane function will be replaced. In time, these giant monopolistic corporations will be able to produce revenue without you. At that point we will be expendable. Cattle. Leeches of a dying system. And it’s coming. You can deny it, run from it, stall it, but it’ll inevitably arrive all the same. The only choice you DO have is how you will react in this lifetime. 

Many or most of this entire generation doesn’t know the harsh realities of history. They have lived in relative times of peace and prosperity. Even the poor in this country will have an iPhone with a roof over their head and a warm meal to keep them from starvation. 

The first possible solution is depopulation. It’s a relatively simple decision to arrive at. There are too many people. Not enough resources. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs. Too much healthcare costs. Fiat money is collapsing under inflation in real time. Climate change will cause large swaths of populations to have to migrate to other lands. Foot shortages and supply chain breakdowns are inevitable. The cozy life you know of being able to get anything and everything down the street at the local Walmart is winding to an end. 

So it seems like a decent proposition to the global elite. The populace is waking up. Kill them off. Reset the system. And educate (propaganda) the youth to reteach them everything about our society. After all, history is written by the victors, not the losers. 

To anyone wondering why Covid would be used to depopulate us and what they have to gain, that’s a large part of that answer. The fourth industrial revolution. So according to this option, we surrender, most die through one means or another, and we place our trust in a global syndicate that has laid out a path and foundation for society to progress forward, albeit in vastly smaller numbers of people. 

Option 2. Revolution. 

You can only achieve so much in this world by peaceful and meaningful protesting. Nobody wants violence. Nobody wants bloodshed. Most of humanity just wants their right to liberty and freedom, to spend cherished time with their loved ones, and perhaps even contribute to society in a great way. We just want to be left alone. 

But when you push people into a corner, much the way a scared animal reacts, people will snap if you push them too far. When a percentage of society hates you just for being white, or straight, or believing in a higher power than themselves, our society has been lost past the point of return. Divide and conquer is a real strategy that has been taking place for millennia. Their biggest free is our solidarity and unity; humanity taking care of themselves and uniting no matter their race, gender, political affiliation, age, culture, or economic background, against the very people who try to divide and distract us from the real evils of society.

The narrative shifts when it suits their purposes. Notice how the previous summer the BLM riots and destruction were justified in the eyes of the elites? They were entitled to it. It was for a just cause. But yet, when much more peaceful protests happens at the nations capitol, in the oddest, most unique election in our nations history believe there is foul play and protest, they are criminals. Any time true protests or riots happen, suddenly they are painted and smeared by the media. If we went by today’s standards, these same politicians would have you convinced that our founding fathers in 1776 were insurrectionists against England. 

Well no shit. That’s the point, the people had enough and revolted. No taxation without representation. Take your laws, kings, and unjust taxes and shove it up your ass. We no longer comply and submit to the King or any of their bestowed leaders. We are a United Nation of free people with the right to pursue life and liberty. 

…but today, our nation is being slowly brainwashed into believing we are all an evil divided people who must look to those very same leaders who sought so many generations ago to escape. Real revolution  requires this. It’s an undeniable fact. No real revolution has ever been spurred by protestors sitting in the streets stopping traffic with “tax the rich” signs. It happens when leaders lose their carefully crafted grip on the people and no longer can control them, forcing them to relinquish power and submit to the will of the people, 

The last and least likely option is mass overhaul. This would’ve been possible in simpler times. But the tentacles of this empire make Rome look like Child’s play. When corruption spans many nations and peoples, let alone the agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI, FDA, IRS, NIH, WHO, CDC, FDA, etc. 

It’s lost. It’s too far gone. And overhauling a system spanning decades of infiltrated corruption is impossible. It must be completely eradicated from the foundation up. Our founding fathers tried their best to ensure we would never be overtaken. They knew from the very beginning, if America fell, it would be from within its own borders, not externally from another source. 

The media, big pharma, big tech, big government, and the military industrial complex have consolidated so much power it’s just simply not conceivable to overhaul such a vast and broken system. 


We are now at a crossroads in humanity. Our leaders have failed us. Our public servants betrayed us. Our CEOs enslaved us. 

The teeter totter is starting to rock back and forth, losing its balance. The scales are tipping. The only control they have over it is censorship and age old techniques to convince the populace of their desired outcome through mass scale propaganda. 

I want you to ask yourself. In 20, 30, 40 years, will you be able to look in the eyes or your child, and explain to them how we let it get so bad? Will you be able to justify staying silent? Because you were scared to lose your reputation? Your job? Your friends? 

Because that time is coming. Our world is changing. Tech is replacing God. Public education is replacing wisdom. Adultery and greed is replacing love and selflessness. Our history is being erased and rewritten. Our freedoms are slowly eroding away in the name of safety. Our privacy is slowly being stripped in the name of security. Our data is being harvested and sold to the highest bidder to keep us in this perpetual never ending cycle of a slow descent into hell. 

I don’t care if your leader is Ghandi, Biden, Jesus, Mohammed, Trump, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It is time to unite as a people and reclaim our rights as a humanity. To love our neighbor. To give back to the less fortunate. To extend our hand and help one another. To show love and freedom of expression. 

Because if we don’t. Make no mistake the teeter totter will continue to tip. And it will eventually tip the scale towards depopulation or revolution. I only ask that we come together as a society, as a United people before it is too late.

While it may have seemed that communist rule would go on forever, when the people decided that they had enough suddenly the wall fell. Just like that.

Thus it is after two years of Covid authoritarianism that in Canada the largest truck convoy in history has smashed through the Berlin Wall of tyranny. I have watched as the Canada I once respected as a haven for antiwar Americans in the 1960s turned into one of the most repressive countries on earth. I wondered how a freedom-loving people could allow themselves to be abused by these mini-Stalins without a peep.

But then Canada stood up and showed the rest of the world that freedom can triumph over tyranny if the people demand it. As I say, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.

Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had been basking in his ability to terrorize the population in the name of fighting a virus. He was so confident in his seemingly unlimited power that he felt he could ridicule any Canadian with different views. The prime minister said in a recent interview that unvaccinated Canadians were “extremists,” “misogynists,” and “racists.”

When the Canadian truckers stood up to his tyranny and began their historic convoy to Ottawa, he thought he could continue ridiculing people. The truckers and their supporters were just a “small fringe minority” who hold “unacceptable views,” he confidently claimed. For Trudeau, love of liberty is just an “unacceptable view.”

Less than a week later, as tens of thousands of trucks began entering the capital with millions of supporters behind them, the “brave” Canadian prime minister had fled the city and shuffled off to an undisclosed location.

As Elon Musk Tweeted, “It would appear that the so-called ‘fringe minority’ is actually the government.”

The Canadian mainstream media is obviously just as obedient to the regime as ours. They ignored the Freedom Convoy for as long as possible. There was almost no reporting. Then, when it became impossible to ignore, they began to attack and ridicule instead of trying to report it accurately. It was disgusting and almost comical to see a “reporter” from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation suggest that the Canadian Freedom Convoy was cooked up by Putin and the Russians!

Thousands of trucks have arrived in Ottawa. They demand an end to covid tyranny. They are backed by millions of citizens, who braved the Canadian winter at night to cheer the truckers on.

This protest is so important because it’s not limited to Canada. The truckers are being supported worldwide, and a similar convoy is being planned from California to Washington, DC. In a US where grocery store shelves are increasingly bare, the truckers have more leverage than the powers-that-be would like to admit.

If I were prime minister of totalitarian Australia or New Zealand – or most anywhere in Europe – I would be getting pretty nervous right now. Just as the Covid tyranny descended across the globe in a seemingly coordinated fashion, now that the Berlin Wall of the tyrants has been breached, it’s just a matter of time before the shockwaves are felt far and wide.

We owe a debt of gratitude to the Canadian truck drivers. Let’s all do whatever we can to help the freedom movement continue to gather steam!""",conspiracy,Musk

https://preview.redd.it/es8k9vzi3we81.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8015ab855f33308d8585accdb8be64e38fccc855

Outside of the accelerator, CERN has already proven its intelligence and ability to impact the world on a grand scale. The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee who worked at CERN, along with some colleagues, in 1989. They created the HTTP protocol which is the standard for communication between servers and clients online, and what you often see at the front of website links today.

Many unexpected and perplexing discoveries have been made over the past decade using this accelerator. One of the earliest, in 2012, was the Higgs boson, also called the ""God particle."" According to world-famous scientist and atheist Stephen Hawking, this particle has the capacity to destroy the universe. In specific, he stated it could initiate the universe's ""catastrophic vacuum decay."" He called the particle's discovery ""a pity in a way.""

Though not a new discovery, a frequent occurrence in the accelerator is the appearance of antimatter. Supposedly, one gram of antimatter is capable of causing as much destruction as four times that of the amount of matter contained in the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. That's the force of 60,000 tons of TNT contained in one gram of antimatter (as the bomb was estimated with a force of 15,000). As technological-and-scientific innovation journal New Atlas puts it:

""Antimatter is basically the evil twin of normal matter.""

Quite randomly, there is a statue of Shiva in front of CERN's headquarters, the Hindu god of destruction who, according to Hindu legend, destroys the universe at the end of its current cycle. He's seen doing a dance inside of a wheel circled by little flames.

A few opening ceremonies have been done publicly for projects pertaining to CERN and they've all been rather… eccentric? To put it lightly. Here are some of the more innocent snapshots from the opening of the longest and deepest railway in the world, the Gotthard Tunnel near CERN:

We have some type of ghostly angel in front of a single vortex-like (All-Seeing) eye, a half-man half-goat reminiscent of the baphomet, and an over-exaggerated crown of thorns. Why such occultic/Biblical themes?

Notice how the goat-man seems in one shot to have worshippers who gasp at him in awe, and in another has what could either be an orchestra for his worship or simply announcement of his presence. In the Bible's Book of Revelation, Satan receives the key to the Abyss, enabling him to release monstrosities onto the Earth, in the end times. (Note that the angel is sounding a trumpet in the first verse):

*""And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.*

*And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.*

*And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.*

*And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads."" – Revelation 9:1-4*

&#x200B;

Travis Scott's Astroworld Fest 2021 draws some fascinating parallels to CERN-related activity. For one, its repeated promotional motto ""See ya on the other side"" reminds me of how many songs reference a so-called ""other side"" by the most popular artists, but it also happens that this phrase was displayed at the front of the stage, inside a tunnel somewhat reminiscent of the accelerator when lit up. Antimatter, also called dark matter, is perceived as residing on an 'other side' of the typical physical reality we \[scientists\] know. CERN's scientists aspire, by means of the accelerator, to 'undo' the Big Bang to understand how it happened and what the status of things were in the universe right before it, or in its very beginning. Despite cautions against such an endeavor from the likes of the most revered minds in science including Hawking, Elon Musk, and Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

[And we all know how this meant-to-be-exciting event turned out.](https://preview.redd.it/1p8b8chx3we81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d10b961a5b9de7f465e0bbc6eb912a0f75560f40)

Speaking of artists talking about an other side, they've also made a habit of calling themselves aliens, beings from other planets, or something along the lines of non-human (David Bowie, Kid Cudi, Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, OutKast). Space/astrology themes continuously become more frequent in pop media. And NASA's been expecting aliens. They'd actually said in 2015 we would have contact with them by 2025. Ironic to consider that, then think of how many people joked that ""2020 is so crazy, we'll probably hear from aliens next.""

Hypothetically, if aliens were to decide to reveal themselves through CERN's accelerator, do we trust these thrilled (majority atheistic) scientists to discern their intention properly? Most people here don't believe in the Bible, but if it were true somehow, would this not be the perfect tactic on behalf of the demons who were cast into the Abyss long ago and made a covenant amongst themselves to return?

&#x200B;

By the way… they're building a much bigger accelerator already, expected to be complete by 2035:

The South Atlantic Magnetic Field Anomaly (SAMFA) is a mega monster magnetic field hole that stretches from South America all the way to South Africa. The magnetic field in that massive area is so weak that satellites have to powered off for their own safety.

SMAFA is moving west 12 mile per year and is starting to split into two. This is extremely important because solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and humans. Scientists are obviously told to downplay the danger. 20 million people live right under the hole in the city of Sao Paulo.

Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc)  \- YT 6 min - Best part starts at 2:45

Scientists and policymakers don't want you to know that magnetic pole shifts can happen in as little time as a hundred years. It can take up to a thousands years too. When this occurs, the earth can have as many as 5 magnetic poles slowly moving around the planet. Exposure to solar/space radiation is increased under these poles which can take up to a decade to pass overhead. Solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and animals.

I believe that the SAMFA splitting into two is the beginning of the multi-polar phenomena. Policymakers prohibit discussion of it by scientists due to fear, panic, money etc. - the usual suspects. It's why you don't know so many things that are extremely important to your well being.

At the same time that the SAMFA gets weaker, we are also losing mid latitude lower stratospheric ozone, which together with the magnetic field, also protects us from the sun. Again policymakers do not want you to know this, that's why there's been a rash of ""Ozone Hole Healing"" articles in recent months.

This is due to scientific academic fraud. The chemicals that were burning a hole in the ozone have not gone away, they are being smuggled as a matter of routine out of China into the US and Europe. The chemicals that replace them are hardly any better. Air conditioning demand is so big that it will use up all our renewable energy power by 2050.

Challenges for the recovery of the ozone layer

The reason this is happening is because of construction fraud. China has built more city blocks in 10 years than America ever did in its whole history. They pour more cement in 3 years than America ever did in 300 years. Substandard material construction fraud is rampant because cement requires a special sand that is quickly running out. Desert sand won't do. So what do we do? We lie about what sand we are using, that's why new condos in Australia and Canada will only last 25 years instead of 50, it's also why new condos are falling apart in Australia.

Do you remember when Volkswagen was caught doing emissions fraud? Turns out it wasn't just them. Fraud in the safety of products and processes are prevalent in the market. This means that fraud is rampant in the control of social media.

The control of social media, and the minds of millions of kids, is paramount to our unending desire to get rich destroying earth. Both capitalism and socialism are based on plenty. Everything you think you know is 100 years old.

We have to stop burning 50% of fuel in 10 years. Scientists are not allowed to say that. They are told they must say, we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. They get paid by tax dollars so they do what they're told.  This is probably one of the last places I'm not banned, and even where I am not banned, these ideas are fought against tooth and nail by young people. The world is run by crooked experts and trigger happy mods. The sons and daughter of the ad media who told you cigarettes are safe, are the same people pushing green energy and 5G - both frauds.

# Bill Gates Claims Musk Buyout Could Make Twitter ""Worse""

📷BY TYLER DURDENTHURSDAY, MAY 05, 2022 - 05:00 PM

Bill Gates might still be sore from Elon Musk's Twitter meme-ing (one of which mocked the Microsoft founder in one memorable, if digitally altered, image) because he shared some fighting words Thursday while speaking during a Wall Street Journal conference on Wednesday.

📷

Speaking at the WSJ's CEO Summit Wednesday, Gates told the audience that, from his vantage point, it's unclear how Musk will change Twitter if and when he takes ownership. Gates also mentioned the possibility that a Musk-owned Twitter could play a greater role in spreading disinformation.

Still, Gates couldn't help but offer a few back-handed compliments to Musk (who recently leaked a series of texts with the billionaire showing him mocking Gates over his short position in Tesla). And while Gates said he ""kind of doubt\[s\]"" that Musk would achieve the same level of success with Twitter, ""we should never underestimate Elon"".

Notably, Gates addressed Musk's ""insults"" (which [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/bill-gates-says-elon-musk-could-make-twitter-worse.html) amusingly refused to reprint), saying they don't bother him. He also questioned Musk's intentions behind his pro-free speech stance.

>""How does he feel about something \[on Twitter\] that says 'vaccines kill people' or that 'Bill Gates is tracking people?'"" Gates asked.  
""What are his goals for what it ends up being? Does that match this idea of less extreme falsehoods spreading so quickly \[and\] weird conspiracy theories? Does he share that goal or not?"" Gates said.

Expounding on the subject of vaccine misinformation, Gates claimed that it would be difficult for Twitter to do an effective job of excising misinformation (keep in mind: Gates is talking about misinformation that mostly has a direct impact on him) with the leadership having espoused such a radical stance.

>""When you don’t have the trusted leaders speaking out about vaccines, it’s pretty hard for the platform to work against that,"" he admitted. ""So I think we have a leadership problem and we have a platform problem.""

Keep in mind: Musk recently succeeded Gates as the world's richest man.

185,The Saturn Moon Matrix,316.0,8x3z3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8x3z3j/the_saturn_moon_matrix/,361.0,1531077876.0,"So a lot of people have been talking about the Moon being a trap for souls. I have a theory on how it all works. This theory may not be too different from David Icke’s, but I believe I may be adding some new insights on Saturn’s connection to the mandela effect, AI, DWave computers, and CERN.

In the ancient past Saturn was associated with Kronos the god of time. Kronos is where we get the image of Father Time and the grim reaper from. The grim reaper carries a scythe because Saturn was also the god of harvest. As well of the god of judgment and a lot of other things. Saturn basically was THE god and most importantly the god of TIME.

Kronos heard a prophecy that one day one of his sons would usurp him as king - so like any rational god he ate all his children. The symbolism here shows us that time consumes everything it creates. It also shows us where Satanists got child sacrifice from because Saturn is actually Satan.

Not only is Saturn the 6th planet from the sun, but it also has a large hexagonal shaped storm on its North Pole. A six sided shape. You can easily find pictures of this taken by NASA. Scientists don’t know why this is. But if we look to cymatics (the study of how sounds affect materials) we can hypothesize that there could be some sort of frequency creating this geometrical shape (since we know regular storms do not form perfect angles).

Oddly enough, a low frequency sign tone creates a hexagon in a medium (such as water/sand/whatever). I say this is odd because the sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan. Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it’s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.

Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun, has a 6 sided shape on its North Pole, AND the 6th day of the week is Saturn-day! The black mass! The day satanists worship.

Now if you take a hexagram and draw some lines on the inside you get a necker cube. This is an important symbol, the cube of Saturn. You can find them everywhere. Do a google search on them. They are even a part of the world’s largest religions. Certain sects of Jews wear mini black cubes on their head when they worship. Muslims go to Mecca to worship at the Kabba - a giant black cube! They even walk around it counter clockwise like the rings of Saturn. The United Nations have a black cube in their “meditation room” as well.

Now let’s take a look into pop culture  - the cube is all over the place here as well. And of course we, the conspiracy theorists, know “THEY” love to hide little messages about what “THEY” know in the movies. 

The transformers features a powerful robotic cosmic cube. Hellraiser features a magical cube that takes you to a hellish dimension. The avengers features a “tesseract”. The name tesseract literally means 4 dimensional cube - the fourth dimension being time. A Wrinkle in Time features a tesseract as a way to travel across space and time. Interstellar also features a tesseract - the weird dimension behind the bookshelf in existing in the past, present, and future. Funny how the wormhole they go through at the beginning of the movie was near Saturn.

My favorite movie however is 2001 Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie features a black cube like structure capable of transporting things through time. Astronauts from the future find this monolith on one of Jupiter’s moons. Ironically, the story originally had it as one of Saturn’s moons but for some reason it was changed. When they find it it emits a loud FREQUENCY.

Is this what’s inside Saturn? A Black Cube emitting a low sine tone? I kind of think so. It reminds me of the Star Trek episode where this one planet is run by a computer that manifests the thoughts of people’s worst fears.

My theory is that Saturn is a supercomputer of sorts, an AI intelligence, that has created a matrix for our souls to get lost in. Remember how Elon Musk called AI “the demon”? What if we already created it long ago and we’ve been trapped in a time loop? History repeats right?

Saturn’s rings work like a giant broadcasting system, and the frequencies from Saturn are being amplified through them and sent to the moon and relayed to Earth. Our brain has been highjacked by this satanic frequency and has made us experience this false reality or illusion.

I forget the name of the scientist but there’s a whole book on it “Saturn’s Ringmakers” or something like that - that talks about how there’s photographic evidence of mile long alien ships building the rings and fixing them up. Maybe they’re reinforcing their machine? And maybe “they” are the reptilians and need this matrix to cause us distress and suffering so they can feed off our negative energy.

Now there’s still a lot more to this. The DWave quantum computers are designed to look like... giant black cubes. Now who uses these? CERN. Both are thought to be responsible for the mandela effect. Have scientists hacked the matrix and found a way to edit reality? Is there a massive quantum computer inside Saturn? Is CERN a portal to Saturn/hell? I also want to talk about language and how it’s the code/software that programs this matrix. Using the languages of this world only solidify the illusion but we can actually use our words to bend it. This is what spells and incantations are. Or what we call today affirmations. But I have to get some sleep - hopefully people are interested in hearing the rest.",conspiracy,Musk

&#x200B;

Hello.  My name is Chris.  I am nobody, really.  An average citizen.  I am an overweight 42 year old white male from the Midwestern suburbs of the US who has been fortunate enough to live a pretty comfortable life.  I used to be a freelance graphic designer with a focus on small businesses, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that that career and part of my life is more than likely over in light of current events.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

I've always been concerned about social injustice and tried to stay politically informed, even dabbling in some activism here and there.  At times I've stepped away from paying attention for my own mental health, or due to laziness, defeatism, whatever.  But I've never stopped caring, or trying, to fight the good fight and do the right thing.

The news recently has of course swept us all up, and touched all our lives in some way or another.  The world has never seen anything like the ""Coronavirus Pandemic,"" and it's clear that our society will be changed forever when we finally come out the other end of this mess.  But I've had the luxury of time recently, and in reading the news about things that were going on, I couldn't help but notice the patterns, and that a lot of stuff didn't exactly make sense.

So, here we go, with the ""conspiracy theory.""

I hate that term, because although it's technically accurate, it's been demonized and weaponized by the media and society at large to take on a bad connotation.  Tinfoil hats, alien abductions, crazy people muttering to themselves, etc.  You've no doubt got a lot of images in your mind of a conspiracy theorist.

And make no mistake, what I'm going to tell you here is all currently very popular conspiracy theory.  However, I think that by removing opinions and conjecture from it, and focusing on facts and things that have already happened, I can present this huge amount of overwhelming, disparate information in a way that makes it less a ""theory"" and more a ""research project.""  And so that is how I have approached this.

I have spent the last week doing little else besides reading every news and opinion article I could find, saving and organizing hundreds of links, and assembling a coherent, logical outline to organize and present these theories, and more importantly, facts.  There are a lot of less-than-reputable sites and publications out there, and I have tried when at all possible to provide sources from verifiable news sites, with a wide range of slants and focuses, to illustrate that what is happening is not part of any one particular political agenda.

I hope that you take the time to check the links, really look into the information presented here, and form your own opinions.  Please do not just take my word for it.  To that end, there are also a few links mixed in that are labeled as having come from r/conspiracy.  These are well-written and well-reasoned posts from other concerned citizens that I think are worth reading, and relevant to the discussion here.

One last thing - If you are new to most of these ideas, the information presented here is more than likely going to seem overwhelming at first.  I encourage you now, and always, to take mental health breaks for yourself, and put down your phone or turn off your computer.  The information will be here when you come back.  And as you'll soon understand, what is happening is an unstoppable tide, truly a force of nature at this point, and there is nothing you can do to fight it, so try your hardest to relax, put on some chill music, hug your dog, and most of all...

BREATHE.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you start researching conspiracy theory, you're going to find a lot of information.  Some much better or worse presented than others, and some much more plausible or unbelievable than others.  Despite the seeming ridiculousness of some things you might read, I encourage you to always approach new information with an open mind.

That said though, I have one main principle that guides all my beliefs about conspiracy theories, and that is the ""Filter of Likelihood.""  Essentially, you have to ask yourself how possible, how likely, and how feasible a piece of information is.  Furthermore, you need to ask yourself what the motivation would be.  In many cases, it's quite easy to see how something makes a lot of sense based on other known info, whereas some theories seem rather implausible no matter how you look at it.

I am interested only in the plausible, and where possible, the already actualized.  Additionally, there's a lot to be said, and a lot that has already been written on many of these topics, so I will focus on current events and simple concepts.

I will also ask you to open your mind to possibility.  Please consider this as you evaluate new information:

1. Do you believe there are things going on in the world that you don't know about yet?
2. Do you believe that there is technology and science you've never heard of?
3. Do you believe that society is progressing at an increasing rate?
4. Do you believe that as populations grow, we require new societal strategies?
5. Do you believe that those with power and money want to retain their power and money?

Of course you believe all these things, and none of these are wild or unusual concepts.  Rather, these are very basic concepts that apply to everyone, and always have.  They are all part of our shared human experience, and undeniable facts of life.  Populations grow, societies evolve, technology advances, and the world changes.  And most important to our discussion here, people, families, and empires constantly [jockey for power and control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-evIyrrjTTY), while fighting for resources, power, fame, and...

**MONEY.**

We all hate TicketMaster, right?  Who do they think they are, what the hell is this bullshit ""service fee,"" etc.  It's something everyone can get behind.  But did you know that TicketMaster willingly cultivates that image?  That venues, teams, and artists, in their pursuit of more money, [raise fees and then let TicketMaster be the bad guy and take the heat so their reputations remain intact](https://stubcrew.com/the-ugly-truth-about-ticketmaster-fees/)?

There are many more people, organizations, and other entities in the world playing that same role for those who really have the money, who really call the shots.  And those who call the shots work very hard and spend absolutely unfathomable amounts of money, time, and blood, to make sure that you don't ever realize who's actually taking your money.

They do this in the simplest, easiest way.  If you simply control information from the top down, and disseminate it when and where you see fit, you can effect great societal change without lifting a finger.

Please imagine... really, try to imagine...  You just read an article, saw a video, whatever, from a very, very reputable source.  And it just informed you that an asteroid was 83% likely to impact the Earth next month.  What would you do? What would happen in the world?

Hopefully an asteroid will not hit next month, but it's important to really imagine what would happen and why, and how.  Because a huge amount of information would be generated and published, people would panic, society would crumble, and the world as you know it would change forever in an instant, the moment you read that headline.

Control of information is one of the most powerful tools known to mankind today.  A person living in 2020 can easily encounter as much information in a day as someone in Medieval times might have encountered in a lifetime.  And it comes at you from all angles, in all forms, non-stop, 24/7.  Much like the water in the pipe, the information is always there, and one needs but turn it on.

Disseminating the information then becomes a practice all its own, and to be sure, [information processing accounts for more than half of the US GDP.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/shenk-data.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)   And the rate at which it's spread, and way it is handled makes a huge difference in the societal repercussions.  So a few different techniques are used:

* **The ""Slow Walk""** \- If a large, unexpected piece of information is given suddenly, people tend to react poorly and irrationally.  Also known as ""letting them down easily,"" this technique restricts the flow of information to prevent the audience from balking or being overwhelmed
* **The ""Steady Drip""** \- This technique involves keeping your audience subjected to a constant stream of the desired information, so that they become accustomed to it and it becomes ""normalized""
* **The ""Firehose""** \- A deluge of information flying out at full blast, designed to overwhelm the audience so that they cannot focus on anything else

It might be the greatest understatement of all time to say that there has been a lot of information passed around about COVID-19, the ""Coronavirus,"" recently.  In fact, there has never been anything like what we are currently experiencing in all of human history, and not by a long shot.  And this unprecedented turn of events has caused a lot of people to react in a lot of ways, and say and do a lot of things, for better or for worse.

Full disclosure: In particular, if you look up conspiracy theory, you'll see a lot of stuff suggesting that the ""Coronavirus is a hoax.""  (You'll also find a lot of poorly-written rambling)  I want to be clear that I DO NOT believe that.  I am 100% sure that there is a Coronavirus, that it is making people sick, that a lot of people are dying, and that our medical professionals and many other undervalued workers are overwhelmed, and breaking their backs every day to do their best to keep their friends, families, and loved ones safe.  I am extraordinarily grateful for them and admire the resolve and bravery that so many have shown in the face of this disaster.  I do not think it is a hoax at all.

However, I think that literally everything else that is happening surrounding the ""pandemic"" is.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**The Pandemic**

In the first week of January this year, I got sick.  Really sick.  I know when I got it and who I got it from, and honestly the exact moment I got it (I only was in proximity of the dude for a few minutes).  He had warned me that he was really sick, and I blew it off.  I started feeling sick a day or two later, and a day or two after that I felt like I was dying.  Fever, chills, aches, extraordinary fatigue.  And literal, nonstop, 24/7 coughing.   I had every single symptom of what we now know as COVID-19.  I commented to anyone who would listen that I didn't recall ever feeling that sick before in my entire life.  The most memorable part of it though was that after a couple days, I completely lost my sense of smell and taste.  Joked a lot about how you could feed me onions and soap cause I'd have no idea.  I try to have a good attitude about being sick.

I spent a week sleeping on the couch before I finally went to the doctor.  She gave me a Prednisolone steroid pack (which has worked well for me in the past), some Trazodone to knock me out, and Benzonatotate for my cough.  As soon as I took the first dose of steroids I started to feel pretty fucking great, and it was more or less a non-issue after that.

I spoke to a lot of people about it then and after, and man, I can't tell you how many stories I personally heard from people I know that said the exact same thing.  Then I started reading the same story over and over again on Reddit:

* [Please leave your experience from November-January if you were Extremely Ill](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjvtdo/please_leave_your_experience_from_novemberjanuary/)
* [An Illness swept through Utah back in December/Early January, was it Covid-19? Did this happen elsewhere?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fotr6p/an_illness_swept_through_utah_back_in/)
* [How long do you really think covid19 has been in the US?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjveej/how_long_do_you_really_think_covid19_has_been_in/)

We didn't start really hearing about the Coronavirus in the media until the beginning of March, and we didn't hear about the ""Pandemic"" until just a couple weeks ago.  And what a couple weeks it's been since then.  But I am quite certain that it's been around for a lot longer and that I, and a lot of other people I know, had it - and DID NOT DIE FROM IT - way back in January.

We now know that the [first documented case in the US was on January 19th,](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) but that word ""documented"" is so, so important here.  That means that we had identified the virus, developed a test, and tested a person with the symptoms that day.  It does NOT mean that was when the virus reached the United States.  How sick do you have to be before you take a day off work? Before you go to the doctor? With America's healthcare system or lack thereof, it's almost certain that many people had this virus before we determined what it was, and how infectious it really was.

There is also the matter of the statistics of severity vs the regular flu.  This is a highly contentious topic and I am no medical expert, and do not wish to make any assertions.  However, what I can tell you from my personal experience is this: I had a horrible ""flu"" in January, got basic medicine, got better.  So, either I had the flu, or perhaps I did indeed have the Coronavirus.

We will never know because I was never tested.  But the important thing is that it *doesn't matter.*  Either I (and many others) had the Coronavirus and it did not kill us (calling into question the severity of the infection) or we just had a bad cold or flu, but it had the exact same symptoms as COVID-19 (calling into question the extent of Coronavirus diagnoses).  But logically, one of those two statements is true.

Furthermore, the data keeps changing, and I don't mean increasing on a daily basis.  I mean up and down, back and forth, it is deadly or maybe it isn't, etc.  On January 14 [the WHO told you it couldn't spread from human to human.](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152)   But then on Jan 19 we saw the [first case of Coronavirus in the United States](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191).  Then it turns out that the [Wuhan market outbreak began earlier in December](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/03/26/Report-Wuhan-market-outbreak-began-earlier-in-December/3021585151249/?ds=5). And then it's an ""epidemic,"" but [most people will only get mild symptoms](https://www.newsweek.com/these-are-mild-coronavirus-symptoms-most-people-covid-19-will-get-1494376).  What are you supposed to believe?  And it sure does seem to come at you as a firehose, and it's hard to even think about anything because OHMYGODTHECORONAVIRUS!

But let's stop and look a couple basic facts.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to let Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi explain this one to you.  This is a very informative 10 minute video, watch it:

[Sucharit Bhakdi - Very clear math showing that the COVID statistics are being manipulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBB9bA-gXL4)

So 80% of people only experience mild symptoms, and we're crashing the economy for this?  The statistics aren't any more extreme than many other illnesses we've had over time, and we're crashing the economy for this?  It doesn't make sense until you consider that there are other factors besides just the virus at play.

[Wolfgang Wodard - Explaining how the statistics are being manipulated to cause panic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyuhbnPOI)

The media, and society at large is inundating you with terrifying information about the Coronavirus.  But if it's not as bad as we originally thought, then why?  We don't freak out about every illness that comes along, and we've certainly never in the history of civilization had over [1/3 of the global population locked down under mandatory quarantine.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/one-third-of-humanity-under-virus-lockdown/ar-BB11Fk7V?li=BBnbcA1)

And then there's the debate about where the virus came from.  We believe it came from a meat market in China, under unsanitary conditions.  The science behind a coronavirus making the leap from one species to another is well-established and researched, and it is a very likely scenario.  There are also conspiracy theories that state that China released it on its people intentionally, or even that the US military released it in China.  Again, we will never know exactly where this Coronavirus came from.  It may be natural, it may be man made, and there are very plausible paths for both.  I don't know what to believe myself.  So here I ask you to make your own judgement based on likelihood.

What we do know though is that the state of the world this virus has been unleashed on has played a major factor in its spread.  In 1950 the global population was 2.5 billion, and that has exploded to almost 8 billion people in 2020.  As a matter of fact, [population growth has been exponential since about the time of the Industrial Revolution.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)

With all these people on the planet there are sure to be many disagreements and conflicts, and there indeed have been.  As a matter of fact, 2019 saw global protests on an unprecedented scale, in Hong Kong, France, Syria, and many other countries.  Citizens have literally been [fighting police and military with rocks, clubs, arrows, and molotov cocktails.](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/17/780268841/hong-kong-protests-intensify-with-molotov-cocktails-and-arrows)

Did you know that?  Despite my seeing headlines and pictures every day of the riots in Hong Kong, I have been shocked to learn that multiple of my close friends, intelligent and aware people, had no knowledge whatsoever of the protests even existing.  But that is far from a coincidence; rather, it is quite by design.

**Billionaires and Coincidences**

Another major talking point over the last 5 to 10 years has been the ""1%"" - the handful of super-rich individuals who posess and control the vast majority of the Earth's wealth and resources.  Where it used to just be a numerical term, ""Billionaire"" is now a dirty word, and one of the nastiest.  We all hate billionaires.  They are evil, and profit off the exploitation of the rest of the world.

The ""Illuminati"" we call them, in pursuit of a ""New World Order.""  Crazy stuff, right?  Mysterious symbols and people in black robes doing nefarious things in secret meetings, and running the world from behind the scenes.  We love the Illuminati, it's a huge pop culture thing now.  The subject of endless speculation, they are made fun of in the media, movies, and now Taco Bell commercials.  It's so far fetched it could never really be true.  And the fact that you think that is by design as well.

So, we don't know where the Coronavirus came from, but it's certainly here, and there are lot of other things unfolding in the world around it.  Many different current events from all different places and fields of study.  Some of it seems a little too coincidental.  It is certainly very coincidental that this economically destructive Coronavirus entered the world right as there were global uprisings, protests in the street, and a growing public hatred for billionaires.

Well, here are a few other coincidences:  [Hundreds of CEOs of major companies stepped down from their positions in recent months.](https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/the-great-ceo-exodus-of-2020/)  Multiple [US Senators sold stock right before the market crashed.](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market) Even the [boss of the New York Stock Exchange sold his own stock](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyse-jeffrey-c-sprecher-kelly-loeffler-sold-company-stock-ahead-of-coronavirus-market-meltdown/) right before the crash.  Did they know something they weren't telling us?

Here's another coincidence.  In 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation published a selection of future-predicting scenarios in the name of ""exploring the ways that technology and development could co-evolve.""  One of these four scenarios, entitled ""[Lock Step](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf),"" eerily predicts a global viral pandemic and the resulting hypothetical consequences, which almost exactly mirrors the COVID-19 pandemic we are in the midst of today.

Also coincidental: [The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in China on November 17th, 2019](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back).  Literally one month earlier, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted [Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY.  In this exercise, they discuss the potential implications and consequences of a novel Coronavirus, including an economic crash, martial law, and of particular interest, the control of information.  (You can view some published highlights [here](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html#highlights))

The [World Economic Forum is comprised of the richest of the rich.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Membership)  The 1%. The Billionaires.  CEO's, politicians, business owners, and many other powerful and influential figures.  They meet regularly to discuss topics of global concern, and [strongly control the dissemination of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos).  And of primary concern to many of them is maintaining their wealth and power in a rapidly-changing world.

And finally, here's one more coincidence:  At the exact same time as the Event 201 exercise, [The World Military Games was held in Wuhan, China, Oct 18-27, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Military_World_Games).  It was the largest military sports event ever to be held in China, with nearly 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries competing in 27 sports.  Wuhan China was, as we now believe, the source of our current global COVID-19 outbreak.

Whether you think it is a ""conspiracy"" or not, that is all certainly coincidental, to say the least.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

***""Why didn't I hear about any of this?""***

That's an excellent question, and one that likely has multiple answers.  For starters, how much do you really pay attention?  Where do you get your news from?  Do you research things you hear or just accept them on hearsay?  Critical thinking skills are paramount in making sense of the chaos unfolding all around us.

As I mentioned before, I can tell you that I personally know multiple people who had no clue whatsoever about the riots in Hong Kong last year.  As you read this, you may be one of them.  And it may seem like something that is happening far away, and ""could never happen here."" Or you may have been aware of it but just that it was happening.  But please, consider for a moment: millions of average citizens risked their lives and safety in the streets of Hong Kong for months on end, fighting police and military, and transforming the city they lived in into a warzone.  WHY?  Why would people do something like that?  Regardless of their motivations, that many people were banding together to fight for something they believed in.  And that is worth considering.

It's not really your fault though that you may not catch wind of all this news.  The ""mainstream media"" that you hear about all the time deliberately controls information - downplaying threats and overreacting to silly things - in order to make sure that you hear the version of the news that they want you to hear.

Did you know that only [6 corporations control 90% of the media In America](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6)?  That number is reduced from 50 companies in the 80's.  And literally all the news you see on TV, at the very least, is 100% owned and controlled by these companies.  Lately, distrust is growing for cable news networks, and many people turn to their local hometown station for trusted news.  The problem with that though is that your hometown station is [probably owned by Sinclair Media](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17202824/sinclair-tribune-map), one of the most powerful broadcast networks in the country that you've never heard of.

Please watch this very brief video, illustrating the [chokehold that Sinclair Media maintains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/02/598794433/video-reveals-power-of-sinclair-as-local-news-anchors-recite-script-in-unison) over your nightly local news broadcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI)

Of course, not every piece of news is pre-programmed but a lot is.  The real news is out there, but sometimes you have to look a little deeper than the infographics on TV news.  Even if information is being directed from the top down, the boots on the ground tend to be passionate people with a variety of interests and agendas, and they are still doing their best to do real journalism despite corporate oversight.

Think of those who are directing the information as steering an impossibly massive ship with a rudder.  You can slowly adjust the course of direction, however it is slow to react.  If you want to stop, you have to start thinking about stopping wayyy ahead of time.  And similarly, once it gets underway, it is then influenced by an inertia all its own.  Micro controls and adjustments aren't really possible.

Our society is this giant ship.  There are 8 billion people on this earth - that is 8000 million.  An incomprehensible number that grows rapidly every day.  As civilization grows and advances, so does our medicine, our technology, our cultural norms.  These are all natural processes that are necessary to manage an increasing number of societies all around the globe.  And many of the advances we're making have exciting potential benefits for humanity, although as with all tools, they also inherently possess the potential for abuse.

Here are some other things happening in society right now, some you may be aware of and many you may not: 

* [RealID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) \- The Real ID law requires people to show security-enhanced IDs to pass through airport security checkpoints or to enter certain federal facilities.
* [Traffic Cameras](https://ggwash.org/view/76623/traffic-cameras-that-are-swift-certain-and-fair-could-enhance-safety-not-be-predatory) \- Most people know that there are traffic cameras in an increasing number of areas, some of which can assess your speed and issue you a ticket automatically.
* [Automation Everywhere](https://retailwire.com/discussion/robots-are-everywhere/) \- Beyond assembly lines, robots are continually performing more types of tasks from ever more companies, replacing human employees at an increasing rate.
* [Automated Trucks](https://interestingengineering.com/automated-trucks-are-coming-much-sooner-than-you-think) \- Autonomous trucks are coming soon that can see forward over a half mile, farther than any other autonomous system in the world, and run during the day, the night and even in the rain.
* [Global Satellite Internet](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/spacex-launch-starlink-coronavirus-scn/index.html) \- Elon Musk's SpaceX recently launched its fourth batch of internet-beaming satellites, as the company builds a broadband internet business by deploying thousands of satellites into orbit
* [Digital Rights Management](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/drm1.htm) \- Technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works, DRM technologies affect copyrighted works, digital media, and even [John Deere Tractors](https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-farmers-right-to-repair/)
* [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-are-cryptocurrencies) \- As digital payments become more and more prevalent, digital currency uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency.
* [Voluntary Nanochipping](https://www.businessinsider.com/swedish-people-embed-microchips-under-skin-to-replace-id-cards-2018-5) \-  People are having microchips implanted into their bodies so that they don't need to carry key cards, IDs, and even train tickets.
* [Programmable Viruses](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/21/yc-startup-felix-wants-to-replace-antibiotics-with-programmable-viruses/) \- As antibiotic-resistant bacteria becomes a greater problem, viruses are being engineered to fight the bacteria in targeted ways
* [Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/port-of-seattle-moves-toward-implementing-facial-recognition/) \- Airports are using facial-recognition cameras to confirm passenger identity.  Mobile phone makers are using face recognition for biometric security.  Retailers are using it to prevent violence and crime, and for advertising.
* [Thermal Scanners](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/03/thermal-camera-market-explodes-coronavirus-spreads/164050/) \- Airports, casinos, and grocery stores are screening passengers for sickness.  In China, this data is being used to control traffic.
* [ID2020](https://id2020.org/)  \- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is developing human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can contain financial data, medical records, tracking tech, and more.

There is an interesting chicken or egg relationship between science fiction and real world science.  Sci-fi writers are inspired by the real science of the day, then they apply their creativity to imagine what might be in the future.  Young scientists encounter these fantastical ideas and think they are worth pursuing, and then set about to make them a reality, and the cycle continues.

Futuristic concepts are then preempted and introduced through the media to the conscious mind, as we include them in books, movies, TV, video games, and more.  Eventually we start seeing headlines of these new technologies and developments happening in other places, usually Japan and China first due to their prevalence in the industrial and technological sectors of our global economy.

""Pilots are required to be in tip-top physical condition, but in 2021, the entire airline industry conspired against the pilot’s individual health and threatened them with termination if they did not partake in the covid-19 vaccine experiment. As a result, over one hundred young pilots have mysteriously passed away in 2021, as countless other pilots suffer silently from adverse events and depleted immune systems.""

""A total of one hundred eleven pilots died in the first eight months of this year! This is a 1750% increase from 2020, when the world was supposed to be in the middle of a pandemic. A list of the deceased individuals was published in the Air Line Pilot Association magazine. In comparison, there were 6 airline pilot deaths in 2020, and only one death in 2019.""

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, im almost not scared by the mass vaccin death anymore, im more woried about what they are planning to do to us, that makes them care this less about society ... a comet ? if we acully could reach space we wouldent need to fake all the content, everything from NASA green screen to Elon musk faking sending up a car into space (glitch showed greenscreen behind the car, video got deleted later)

ive gone from loving space and laughing at flat eart to belive 20/80 that ""earth"" is a terraformed creation . This is satans world and we all know it, satan is saturn, and saturn is the demigod that the gnostics wrote about, the master AI, parasitic AI.

If earth is a simmulation, wich is mainstream now. then a earth with a fake space would take such much less data. The multiverse would make so much sense if this what the only thing being created. not a entire universe with unlimited black holes and new universes. Only the true god could create something like that. The gnostics said this reality is a bad copy of the true reality ... this gives me goosebumps. with all the suffering in this world i hope there is a creation thats runned with the good force, the true mamalian spirit, the loving force of all creation. the spirit of sophia

I think this is why the jewish freemasons are obsessed with death, cause the creator of this world is satan. in todays science we even have a thing called luciferase, when they inject stuff to pass thrue the body, they use luciferase to see it, cause it shows light. The jews belive that lucifer IS light, and all we see is light = inside lucifers world

And saturn is sending us the frequency to keep us locked in. Its even proven that saturn is sending us frequencies, low ones, wich will keep us in a war state, signals amplified by our moon. Lissen to sounds of saturn on youtube, its like 1000s of soles screaming in pain. the place we go after death.

Dont go into the wite light, its a trap. this is the SOLE-LURE system (solarsystem)

Just wanted to share.

Trying to manifest world wich this is not the timeline of revelations, and CERN dont release the beast. We need to be strong guys, we are in for a ride to say the least. Having the goverment destroying society like this, they might not plan to keep us alive at all. but i hope so.

Stay strong guys, this will be one bumpy road. At least i tought i would be able to train my ass off in the gym to cope with reality, but as of now we cant even do that anymore due to vax pass. And fuck you NASA for reading this text, we know your sabbatean khazar sins

Epstein has 12 phone numbers - including an emergency contact number - and two home addresses listed under Pritzker’s name. What’s even creepier is that there is a subtitle under his name that reads “Numero Uno”. Usually when Epstein adds a subtitle under someone’s name, it indicates what company they work for or a relationship of some kind (ex: X’s husband or Y’s friend). The fact that ‘Numero Uno’ is the subtitle under Pritzker’s name is unsettling, to say the least.**

I really don't need to stream on 10 different monitors at 8K while in the middle of the Amazon or in the Gobi desert. 

There have been reports of people being really freaked out about seeing a long line of ""stars"" or UFO's around dusk or dawn, and it is the satellites.  Astronomers are really pissed about these and it's going to rally mess up people's time lapse photos of the night sky.  Do you really want to see 10,000 artificial satellites in the night sky?  What gives this man the right to do this?  This is the type of thing that people kill over.  We've seen ecoterrorists kill over cutting down a tree, what do you think similar people would do over this?

Also, how much of his money has come from the gov or subsidies?  It really seems like Tesla is a propaganda company for the green movement, and he has created a cult that gives him protection to do these things.  Criminal. 

Some people believe these satellites have projectors built in, laser, holographic, whatever.  You know where that theory leads, if not, well look.

There seems to be some censorship going on on YT with these starlink videos. There were about 15-20 really good video's of the latest release, maybe last week, and there were some other very interesting moving objects around the line of satellites, moving and changing direction, not like normal satellites, but I can't find any of them now, should have downloaded them...  Some had over a million views, so IDK why the poster would remove them, and people were commenting a lot.

So they find a prominent technologist and make him brand their satellite network under his name. They disguise it as commercial internet but keep their military access.

If there is ever a new global war, fully autonomous drones can operate over the entire world, be solar charged, with all the operators safe in bunkers in the U.S.

I would not be surprised if the Starlink satellites had simple evasive maneuvers that will only be used if there are attempts to shoot them down.",conspiracy,Musk

CYBER WINTER would mean total financial collapse because modern day economics cannot function without the internet. How is the Russia-Ukraine war connected to it? It is quite simple actually. 

US has declared that it will not enter the war and instead rely on economic sanctions. Mostly these sanctions have no meaningful impact on Russia, so WEF people among Biden advisers have proposed that US should ban Russia from SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) which accounts for 5 trillion$ worth transactions every day. Now that Russia has started its “Military Technical” solution to the Ukraine problem, Biden’s advisers have upped the ante on the SWIFT ban which will likely materialise within the next week.

Russia has already said that the “SWIFT ban” would be treated as “financial Nuking” warfare and the Russian response is going to be catastrophic. 97% of global communications traffic including some 10 trillion dollars of financial transactions happen through undersea cables. Russia is the only country that has developed, at tremendous expense, a sophisticated capability using exotic and highly specialized nuclear submarines and ships to attack these undersea cables which will completely halt global telecommunications networks (imagine how will Elon Musk’s Starlink then become the only way to use internet!). This scenario of total collapse of global communications has already been predicted by WEF last year through the CYBER POLYGON event. Lest you forget, EVENT 201 was the precursor to COVID-19, now CYBER POLYGON will become the precursor to the coming Cyber Winter!

Then the great reset will happen in full flow. The hyper-inflated dollar and the over 300% global debt will all be cancelled without hurting the powerful elite while the Central Bank sponsored digital currency will be ushered in after communications are restored. Welcome to the NEW WORLD ORDER!

Every one of these groups has their role in the assisting of creating false narratives and manufacturing consent and it is through keeping the vast majority of the population trapped in these incorrect paradigms that they have any power over us to begin with.

How many elites are there in a the world, really? A few thousand, tops. We hear the same names being circled around and around for the most part, and then if we add the ones in the shadows we DON'T know about and their most trusted associates, we truly and literally outnumber them a million-to-one... which honestly really goes to show you just how cunning and experienced these players are on the global chess board. It's quite a feat to be able control that many people.

Now, honestly imagine being born into a family like that and knowing the truth about how EVERYTHING operates in this world without having to guess. Are Alex Jones, Elon Musk and Russell Brand controlled opposition? There is no guesswork. You just know. (Whereas I do not.) So your worldview is not only certain, but you see how easily just a small handful of you are able to fool billions of people. It might astonish you at first to discover this as you grew up, and that astonishment might turn into contempt for a species of creatures so easily controlled. It's not hard to see aspects of their worldview, even if I disagree with it... but this is where it gets interesting.

I don't think the elites counted on us evolving as fast as we have out of a dark slumber, and I don't think they realize their contempt for us is completely misplaced, as humans aren't exactly given the chance to make a choice when they grow up programmed from birth. The 90's and 2000's were a time of connecting organically on the internet and it proved that humans DO, when given a chance, learn, grow and break free of conditioning much quicker as they learn about each others differences. The wild west of the internet was an amazing time. The **vitriol** we see on the internet is LARGELY due to everything going mainstream around 2005-2010 and narratives of division starting to be manufactured there. Prior to that, human beings self-regulated much more successfully online and we respected one another. We are NOT the sheep we think they are by **default.** It is only through lifetimes of conditioning us that the elites get the results they want. We got a little freedom on Internet 1.0 for a while to explore as we saw fit and that freedom was waking us up organically, so Big Brother panicked, came in and started regulating everything as quick as he could. Took them a while though... long enough for some of us to experience the \*vast\* difference that social media and Silicon Valley have made.

Do you guys remember this 1 minute scene from A Bug's Life? (bottom) I wouldn't be surprised if the rise of the internet and the new ability to instantly share information sparked conversations like this behind closed doors. In essence, THEY realize that if WE realize what they are up to and that we vastly outnumber them, they're completely screwed. It is only through the *illusion* of control that they actually have any control, and as long as they keep billions of people brainwashed and docile, they will maintain that power.

The good news is, not every single one of us has to wake up. We outnumber them SO much that we only need a fraction of people to wake up, and we're getting closer, for a tipping point.

The bad news is, those that remain asleep will stand in our way. However, like everything else manufactured on the internet, I'm convinced there are FAR less of them than we're led to believe. Most people will either be on our side or will remain on the fence and let the battle play itself out. The elites have far fewer allies than they want us to believe. The easiest way to realize this is just ask yourself, **how many people do you actually know that like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?**

So if you wonder why things in the world are so absolutely chaotic right now and have been since 2020, I suspect it's because the Elites are realizing they are running out of time. Covid was a Hail Mary for them and it failed, so now they're crashing the economy and starting a war. They know if they don't get a noose around the 1st world quickly, it's going to be over for them. So in a sense, take heart. Their sloppiness lately is a result of them rushing the plan out of panic.

We vastly outnumber them.

Peace.

President Trump is a private citizen who holds no official power. The one who controls Social Media controls the Narrative. And we have two dueling parties in America. Republican and Democrats. Democrats have successfully taken over Social Media platforms. Yet they lost control over the most powerful one when Seto Kaiba said Screw the rules I have money and bought Twitter.

Rare Earth Elements. The elements that make the information age possible. People could understand the First Gulf War and the Geopolitical importance of oil. That was easy, but it still didn't sound morally just to have a war for oil. It was too imperialist and so they fell in line and supported a war for Kuwaiti freedom instead, despite the obvious and public manipulation at the UN by Nayirah. 

This is some of her testimony to the Human Rights Council. 

While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It was horrifying. I could not help but think of my nephew who was born premature and might have died that day as well. After I left the hospital, some of my friends and I distributed flyers condemning the Iraqi invasion until we were warned we might be killed if the Iraqis saw us.

The Iraqis have destroyed everything in Kuwait. They stripped the supermarkets of food, the pharmacies of medicine, the factories of medical supplies, ransacked their houses and tortured neighbors and friends.

There was only one problem. She was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign, which was run by the American public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government (fun fact, Hill & Knowlton also have extensive ties with Bill Gates). 

So the public was aghast at her testimony and supported the war against the mainly Soviet backed, but also American supported and Soviet backed Saddam Hussein, in his war against Iran, after the Iranians refused to Ally with American interests after the Islamic Revolution. 

But that was oil, this was Rare Earth Elements. There was a reason the war was called, Operation Enduring Freedom. This natural resource was far more important in the long run. You couldn't have a security surveillance apparatus without it. And what was supposed to be a war on terror was in actuality a territorial occupation for resources. 

Sleeping Dragon China is next, and where there's smoke, there's fire. 

Let's go point form for clarity.

About 60% of US rare earth imports are used as catalysts for petroleum refining, making it the country’s major consumer of rare earths.

The US military also depends on rare earths. Many of the most advanced US weapon systems, including smart bombs, unmanned drones, cruise missiles, laser targeting, radar systems and the Joint Strike Fighter programme rely on rare earths. Against this background, the US Department of Defense (DoD) stated that “reliable access to the necessary material is a bedrock requirement for DOD”

Beijing also demands that those outlets, as well as TIME and Voice of America, share information with the government about their operations in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says the moves are in response to the U.S. government’s decision earlier in the year to limit the number of Chinese journalists from five state-run media outlets in the United States to 100, down from 160, and designate those outlets as foreign missions.

And here we are. You may have noticed the Rare Earth Elements and the inclusion of Environmental Standards. Yes these are key to understanding the Geopolitical reality and importance of these events. There's a reason the one child policy stopped. Troop additions. 

I believe our current political reality started at Tiananmen square. The protests were an American sponsored attempt at regime change after the failure to convince them to leave totalitarian communism and join a greater political framework. 

Do I have proof? Yes. 

China, as far as I'm concerned, was responsible for the 2008 economic crisis. The Rare Earth Elements were an attempt to weaken the States and strengthen themselves simultaneously. This stranglehold either forced America to trade with China, or the trade was an American Trojan horse to eventually collapse their economy and cause a revolution after Tiananmen Square failed. Does my second proposal sound far fetched? Didn't the economy just shut down in response to the epidemic? Aren't both sides blaming the other? At this POINT, the epidemic seems to be overstated doesn’t it? Don't the casualties tend to the elder demographic and those already weakened by a primary disease?

Exactly the kinds who wouldn't fight in a war. 

Does this change some of my views on the possibility of upcoming catastrophes and reasons for certain events? No. This is Chess, and there are obvious moves in chess, hidden moves in chess, but the best moves involve peices which can be utilized in different ways if the board calls for it. 

Is all what it seems? No. 

I definitely changed a few previously held beliefs prior to today, and I would caution you in advance that you will find some previously held convictions challenged. 

After uncovering what I did today, I would also strongly suggest reading information cautiously. This is all merely a culmination of ending the cold war, and once I have events laid out, you will see it as well. 

At this moment, the end analysis is a war will start in the near future. This will be mainly for a few reasons, preemptive resource control for water and crops, population reduction can be achieved since we have too many people, not enough jobs, and upcoming resource scarcity. 

Did you notice my omission of rare earth elements? This is because of Afghanistan. I would wager China or Russia is somehow supporting the continued resistance through Iran. But events are now accelerating with China because the western collation has already begun to build up their mines and start production. 

Do you remember when Trump made a ""joke"" about buying Greenland? Yeah. It turns out that Greenland has one of the largest rare earth mineral deposits on the planet. 

Take care. Be safe. Stay aware and be prepared.

It should be pretty much clear that since Trump entered the political arena, the established measures and tests for GOP leadership have shifted dramatically. Like him or not, Trump did come in as somebody with little direct political experience, and in addition, he certainly did not toe the elite line in political etiquette. This was a standard attack from his 2016 opponents, who referred to him back then as somebody unstable and outside of the proper etiquette that had become the norm in political royalty.

The reason why I pose this question is simple. Recently, we've had some names thrown about for the prospect of a GOP nomination in 2024. DeSantis and Mike Pence come immediately to mind. And despite all the media rattling about these two postings as a credible threat to Trump's second-term ambitions, the fact is that the support behind Trump is still more vocal and under narrative control. Yes, we can say that much of the GOP voting base would be content with those two Trump alternatives, but the excitement is just not there. DeSantis is a fairly established political operative with strong ties to the old guard. Mike Pence is more so, and his evangelicalism has also been somewhat of a thorn. They don't carry on that populist spirit that Trump seems to have over his supporters, and while their voting is in no doubt, the narrative and enthusiasm will not be there at the same level.

Where does the GOP go from there? Whenever Trump leaves the political limelight, finding somebody as effective will not be easy. That shows an apparent lingering concern that political operatives must figure out. As I said, Trump voters are easily transferable within the GOP, but that energy and perceived outsider perspective will be lacking. Who else? Elon Musk? The Trump kids? Am I right in wondering if this is an energy problem that will need to be addressed?",PoliticalDiscussion,Musk

Now here is the question, if we allow EVERYONE to express opinions freely without constraints of any sort, there will definitely be extreme views that are generally considered appalling such as Nazism, White supremists, LGBT hate, pro-slavery, terrorism, on top of more debatable topics such as abortion, euthanasia, death penalty etc.

Also, certain countries like spreading fake news, using photoshopped/deepfake pictures/videos, playing word games to distort the meaning, abusing bot accounts to give a twisted ""majority"" view etc. Should freedom of speech allow this to happen?

However, it should also be noted that  different religious and cultural views should be respected. American values might not be applicable to muslim countries, for example.

The problem being most people likes to hear voices they already agree with, so they fall into an echo chamber that only reinforce their ideology until one commit extreme actions. Also not everyone is gifted with a scientific mindset to seek for truth everytime they read news. Some people are anti-science or pro-conspiracy during early COVID, some uses their emotional hemisphere to think instead of logic on major world issues.

What is the line between freedom of speech and censorship? We now believe LGBT hate is bad, what about Muslim countries banning the new disney movie because there are gay actors? If it is the country's right to ban homosexuality, is it censor-worthy if they advocate anti-gay?

So let's talk campaign finance.  According to the FEC, the current limits for individual contributions to candidates is $2,700.  This is reflective of reform from McCain-Feingold that is designed to empower individuals and reduce the power of the wealthy and privileged in society in accordance with the concept of ""one man, one vote.""

Is this the evidence against Hillary Clinton?  Maybe I'm naive, but I've literally been pointed to OpenSecrets to reveal to me how corrupt and bought Hillary Clinton is by big corporations.  And look Reddit, I get that corporations are the bane of your existence (unless they're run by Elon Musk).  But I feel like when some people talk about corporate giving they envision Mr. Rich Moneybags, Chief Donation Officer at JPMorganKochSachs quite literally writing million dollar checks to Secretary Clinton and Senator Rubio while twiddling their handlebar mustache and laughing at the proles.  

Yes, I do know that many bankers are Pro-Hillary, and they use the Super-PAC backdoor to give obscene amounts of money to her campaign (a backdoor that Bernie uses to do the same from unions).  But do you think Reddit as a whole tends to misunderstand how campaign finance works?  I must say, I have been trying to learn more about it recently, and it is a little complicated.  But I feel like there is a great amount of misinformation about campaign finance.  

I can donate unlimited money to Super-PACS; you as well.  It's definitely a concerning premise--the idea that politicians can be bought.  But I think Reddit--and perhaps media as a whole--is guilty of improperly characterizing the issue as an unfair struggle between the cigar puffing, whiskey drinking, sport-coat wearing mega-donors of the Clinton campaign and the piggy bank-breaking working man donors that support Sanders.

Meanwhile, NASA is increasingly being portrayed as meandering without clear direction and goals, and being hostage to congressional pork-barreling and make-work megaexpensive projects like SLS, without any clear purpose. Also, despite space fans claims, spending on NASA isn't actually very tiny at all ( about $19B a year ) in context of other non-defense discretionary spending. The entire National Science Foundation for example gets only about $7-8B a year.

This topic hasnt almost come up on campaign trail at all, and we don't have Newt Gingrich moonbase jokes either this time around.

Does anyone believe there is anything to be expected from Hilldawg or Trump in this area, at all ? What about after elections ? Obama has sent a few public congratulations towards SpaceX ..

Andrew Yang famously made it a core part of his platform in the last presidential election. Even some billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have voiced their support as an answer to fears of automation. In recent years, there have also been some smaller-scale preliminary experiments to test the feasibility of the idea.

90% of the time it is seriously discussed, however, the question of how it would apply to non-citizens and immigrants rarely ever comes up. After all, if one country implements a nationwide UBI, that country would become a very attractive destination for migrants everywhere especially if it is one of the few that does so.

**If mass technological unemployment of over 50% does occur in the future due to automation and a UBI sufficient for basic needs is implemented, would those who are not citizens have access to it? Or will it remain true to its other widely-used moniker, a citizens' income?**",PoliticalDiscussion,Musk

Dr. Greene’s series catapulted the imaginations of many young people in the direction of pursuing new scientific knowledge. Such discoveries are ultimately what help to advance the human condition. ""The Elegant Universe"" was a NOVA series, brought to our young imaginations by PBS. 

In 1984, during his third State of the Union speech Ronald Reagan said to our nation's citizenry and its congress, ""Families stand at the center of our society. And every family has a personal stake in promoting excellence in education... Excellence must begin in our homes and neighborhood schools, where it's the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child."" 

PBS programming helps parents and teachers in providing quality, educational content that aids parents, teachers, and children in promoting the educational excellence that Ronald Reagan understood to be so important if we expect our nation's economy to grow, and our society to succeed. In that same address President Reagan said, ""America is too great for small dreams."" I agree with Ronald Reagan, we as a people have a right to dream grand dreams.

Governor Mitt Romney is a candidate that apparently disagrees and instead dreams of small, short term, even antiquated actions that cannot help American citizens overcome the grand challenges we are faced with, but worryingly, may instead stifle the continued promotion of American excellence. Mitt Romney claimed in the first presidential debate that he'd defund PBS to reduce the deficit. Mr. Romney would defund this service even though PBS programming is a large part of the reason why I (in addition to so many other young adults) am pursuing a PHD and a life of scientific research. 

Further, although former Governor Romney claims to want to promote American jobs he doesn't seem to have even the slightest grasp on the past, present, and likely near-future of the history and sociology of science and technology. He (perhaps thusly) also apparently lacks a clear understanding of modern macroeconomics. He complains of there being too few American jobs, and lackluster American innovation in the present regarding American-centric energy and transportation technology, and then turns around and attacks one of America's chief entrepreneurs (a South African immigrant) and one of this entrepreneur's (successful) companies which has created 3,500 future-safe American jobs. That company is Tesla Motors.

Just yesterday in Tesla Motors Incorporated's Third Quarter 2012 Shareholder Letter the public was informed that, ""One month from now, we expect Tesla to double production again and achieve the target rate of 400 cars per week or 20,000 per year. Despite many short term costs associated with the ramp, Tesla nonetheless expects to get approximately halfway to the 25% gross margin target by end of year."" 

And it's easy to see why:

""By placing solar panels over existing highway rest stop parking spaces where we pay little to no rent, our Supercharger operating costs are so low that we are able to offer free, sustainably powered long distance travel to Model S customers. This system makes long distance trips in an electric car better than, not merely on par with a gasoline car. All it takes is one road trip where you didn’t have to stop at a gas station, immerse yourself in fumes and pay $100 to fill your tank to appreciate the difference.""

For his shortsightedness, for his inability to dream grand dreams as Ronald Reagan did, as I do, as has become the tradition for American dreamers in all 50 states, I'm voting against the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Thus, I am voting for the reelection of our current, incumbent president Barack Obama (whom I voted against in 2008). Now is not the time to narrow our national vision, to limit our citizenry's potential, now is not the time to abandon greatness, nor to dream small dreams.

In conclusion, our national ills cannot be cured by cutting the likes of the Public Broadcasting Service’s revenue stream. Do yourself a favor, and consider allowing Brian Greene the chance to show you just how elegant our universe truly is! If you're a parent then feel free to watch with your children, and make sure to tell them that they will have the opportunity to discover elegance within and of our universe on a level even surpassing that which can be learned from listening to Dr. Greene, should they realize that they really want to. Your children’s generation will be able to go farther than our generation will. Your children’s generation will be able to have opportunities beyond anything you or I will ever know, because they will stand on our generation's shoulders, just as we stand on President Reagan’s generation’s shoulders, but only if we commit to continue dreaming grand dreams!

It reminds me a bit of the old climate change debate format, where right wing news would bring on an expert on climate change supported by 99% of scientists and then find one scientist who denied climate change. Suddenly they appear on equal footing.

Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont, had been leading in the polls, so his victory wasn’t a surprise. But he and Buttigieg were closely bunched with the third-place candidate, Amy Klobuchar, allowing all three to claim either victory or solid momentum going into the next round of voting.

At the same time, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were headed toward poor showings and failed to get any delegates, NBC News projected.

The mighty US had been defeated at the hands of a small guerrilla force, the viet cong. Armed left wing revolutionary movements were springing up every place on earth, from Latin America to South East Asia. It almost seemed like Khrushchev’s famous quote (“Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you.”) was about become a reality. However within the next decade, communist expansion ceased and the heart of the communist power, the soviet union collapsed.

The reason was simple and it was basic economics. Soviet collectivist socialistic economy could no longer fund the  expansionist intentions of the Politburo. One day the chicken came home to roost when Gorbachev tried limited reform to solve the underlying economic malaise with Perestroĭka and Glasnost, but the house of cards simply collapsed.

Something similar is going to transform in the coming decade and the expansionist Jihadi ideology will also see a similar collapse. If one has to understand this, one has to understand the pillars of Jihadi power globally. There are three important power center’s for the Islāmic Jihad – Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. All three of them will be seriously affected by the coming technological disruption.  The advent of the electric car and the resulting insignificance of oil.  Elon Musk has single-handedly contributed to the eventual destruction of the edifice of global Jihad.


Viewed in today’s context, where oil prices are spiking on a daily basis and the opposition is planning to make it one of the main planks for the coming election, talking about the decline of oil seems counter intuitive. However in the mid to long-term, oil is poised to decline. To understand this, the below factors need to be considered.

Tesla built 5,000 of its Model 3 electric sedans in a single week in the last week of June. Just looking at cars — not pickup trucks or SUVs — this would make model 3 the #9 or #10 best selling car in the USA.

In April 2018 alone, Electric vehicles accounted for 8% of California’s market. This has important implications. While the electric vehicle adoption for the larger US market might be still in the “innovator” stage, there are key pockets where market is near the threshold of “early adopters” stage basis the quoted “Rogers diffusion of innovation”

China is blistering in its pace of adoption of electric vehicles. Car makers have to make sure at least 10% of all vehicle produced are new energy vehicles by 2019 and 12% by 2020. 2.7% of all vehicles sold in China are new energy vehicles, making China the largest EV market in the world. China also restricts the no of licenses available for gasoline and diesel cars available for issue in major cities thus forcing consumers to opt for electric vehicles.

Most people assume small hatchback when people mention about electric vehicles. However, in case of China, the revolution is in urban mass transport. China had about 99 percent of the 385,000 electric buses on the roads worldwide in 2017, accounting for 17 percent of the country’s entire fleet. Every five weeks, Chinese cities add 9,500 of the zero-emissions buses—the equivalent of London’s entire working fleet

5. every 1,000 battery-powered buses on the road, about 500 barrels a day of diesel fuel will be displaced from the market, according to BNEF calculations. This year, the volume of fuel buses take off the market may rise to 279,000 barrels a day, about as much oil as Greece consumes 

The long and short of it is that we have seen what will be one of the last oil price peaks. Irrespective of Tesla and its survivability or Trump’s disdain for clean energy, the technological revolution initiated has a momentum of its own. Electric vehicle technology evolution follows more closely the exponential growth of the electronic industry rather than the linear path of the traditional auto industry, All it took was a decade for the smart phone to become the dominant communication device, it will take another decade for Electric vehicle to become the dominant mode transportation.

The current high oil price has been driven more by the supply side shocks rather than robust uptake in demand. The disruption of oil production in Libya, Venezuela and US sanctions on Iran, coupled with production cutsby OPEC+Russia is the main reason behind the jump in prices. This is primarily driven by Saudi’s need for 80$ to 100$ per barrel for the successful listing of Aramco. If you are skeptical of my forecast of decline of oil, then check out what former Saudi oil minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani is purported to have said, “The Stone Age came to an end not because we had lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have lack of oil.”

This once in century change has wide-ranging implications across all nations, but for our purpose today let us look at the three principal states – Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey

Iran– Iran with a large restive population coupled with the ongoing sanctions makes it the most vulnerable of the three. The unrest which started in last December continues to simmer to this day. The renewed sanctions under Trump is already causing Iran’s economy to collapse even at oil price of $75 per barrel. Since the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, the rial has lost more than 40% of its value. European companies are leaving Iran in droves, threatening not only trade and investment but also Iran’s ability to sell oil at current volumes. Protests are turning violent day by day, with security forces even shooting at protesters protesting against water scarcity using machine guns and automatic rifles.

The  protests are directed towards the clerical regime that rule Tehran. The decline in oil can be significant driver for a regime change in the next few years. The most interesting thing to note in that case is that Iran today is one of the most conservative theological societies in the world. It cannot go further theologically and in fact it is very much possible that Iran would swing the other extreme towards an anti conservative society as demonstrated by the protests against the Hijab. At the least Iran’s capability to export instability and extremism to the wider middle east will become limited.

Saudi Arabia– Saudi Arabia is highly dependent on oil, much more than the other two. However, the significant resources and relatively modest population allows it more leeway than the rest. Even then, IMF estimates that Saudi Arabia needs a oil price of $88 per barrel for balancing its budget, social and foreign commitments. That is the reason why the young Saudi prince is trying desperately to diversify his economy. This year alone, the government raised electricity and petrol prices, introduced a VAT, and required companies to pay extra fees to employ foreigners forcing thousands of foreign workers to leave the country

Saudi has been the main progenitor Wahhabi extremism driven by Salafistic preaching. It has funded Madrassas from Indonesia to Morocco. The decline in oil prices will definitely impact all of these. Though the young prince is trying hard to divest away from oil, it will be a tough road ahead. In all likely, Saudi would be declining power who will sulk at the decline influence and power it can wield (like UK post the glorious days of its empire). It will not completely stop export of Wahhabi ideology and turn into a modern chick society but its power and ability to spread ideology will rapidly decline.

Turkey– In essence, Turkey is the sole Islāmic power who is not tied to the fortunes of oil. Turkey has a large ￼domestic economy and a manufacturing base. It has a well-educated population and is a member of G-20 and OECD. Thus for Turkey, the decline in oil’s role is immaterial except for the positive impact on trade balances and inflation. However Turkey today is on the brink of crisis driven by the current president’s cronyism rule. The Turkish Lira continues to be one of the worst performing currency in the world. Inflation continues to be at a staggering 15% and combined with large current account deficit, some are predicting an eminent economic collapse on similar lines as Asian financial crisis

However, it is presently hard to ascertain the implications of an economic collapse. Will the population turn even more conservative, breeding religious extremism or will they revert back to the secular ideology as envision by Ataturk. The repercussion will be felt across Europe to Middle east. It is how Turkish react which will be decisive how political Islam will pan out.


,Thus there is a high chance that what we see today is the peak of global Jihadi ideology. While no one can certain of the future and it is very much possible that the same ideology might raise its ugly head in the long future (like socialism‘s come back in US). We can safely ascertain that the coming decade will be critical in the fight against this venom.",geopolitics,Musk
