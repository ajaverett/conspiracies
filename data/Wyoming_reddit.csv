Gates also has a $125 million estate in Washington, a luxury car collection, a $43 million 5,800 square foot mansion in California, multiple private planes, and much more.",2731.0,lks8i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lks8i7/bill_gates_has_a_new_book_coming_out_in_which_he/,404.0,1613438178.0,"Bill Gates has a new book coming out in which he states, ""To avoid a climate disaster, we need to eliminate emissions from the ways we create electricity, grow food, make things, move around, and heat and cool our buildings."" 

I wonder how much electricity is used to air condition an 5,800 square foot mansion in Del Mar, California year round? 

According to [this article by Business Insider,] (https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-bill-gates-net-worth-spending-2018-8#gates-reportedly-pays-to-have-sand-imported-from-st-lucia-in-the-caribbean-to-the-shore-surrounding-his-house-18) Gates has sand imported from St. Lucia in the Caribbean for his $125 million estate in Washington. Is that good for greenhouse emissions? My sheep brain barely understands any information that doesn't come from authorities with a monopoly on violence. 

Gates also has a 4.5 acre ranch in Florida with a 12,800 square foot mansion. Does the radiation emitting from Bill Gates' nuclear powered super brain generate the electricity needed to air condition year round a 12,800 square foot mansion in Florida? 

He also has another 228 acre ranch in California, a 492 acre ranch in Wyoming, and he also ""treated his family to a Mediterranean vacation on board the 439-foot superyacht Serene, which he chartered for $5 million a week. It included a helicopter.""

But I guess us plebs need to walk to our happy citizen work camp and eat powdered grasshoppers? 

Gates in his new book warns that, [""Getting to zero will be really hard. Because every plan to achieve anything starts with a realistic assessment of the barriers that stand in your way.""] (https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-new-climate-book-is-finally-here?WT.mc_id=20200214180000_HTAACD_BG-TW_&WT.tsrc=BGTW)

Oh cool. How do you eliminate barriers, Bill? ""We have some solutions we need to deploy in a big way now, and we also need a lot of innovations to be developed and spread around the world in the next few decades...we have big goals for solving the problem as more national and local leaders around the world commit to doing their part.""

Oh so leaders who allegedly represent sovereign nations of sovereign people just have to do whatever you say. Got it. 

Also: https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1361152602419814404

Only people who Bill Gates follows on Twitter or who he mentions can reply to his tweets. I thought social media echo chambers were destroying the world? 

Fuck Bill Gates. No Gods, No Masters.

Edit: For all the people saying, ""His mansions have solar panels and he drives electric cars.""(lol neoliberals) Watch Planet of the Humans. What are solar panels made out of? We need to REDUCE, not pillage the planet for rare earth minerals so the tech dystopia can be 'green'. Bill Gates is a lying, manipulative narcissist. He's giving it all away to the poor? Then why'd he add $100 billion to his net worth over the last 15 years? Fire him into the sun.

**I AM NOT DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE**

I know logic and reason is tough for most people, but if you read this post as a denial of climate change or that I'm somehow advocating that nothing should be done, you're obviously trapped in ideological thinking. Suspend your ideological framework for two seconds and ask yourself: is it hypocritical for a multi billionaire with palaces all over the globe to lecture the poor about necessary sacrifices? Yes or no? Maybe the oligarch who recently became America's largest landowner has some ulterior motive behind championing climate change? The genuine people I know and have known who champion climate change do things like eat a plant based diet, build bio passive thermal homes out of garbage, and bring their personal consumption to a bare minimum.",conspiracy,Wyoming

Hey guys, so I have noticed in the past tons of posts about water fluoridation and I decided to do what I do best and compile all of the links and evidence together into one giant reference table. Enjoy! 



All assumptions aside, I am relying on strict, hard evidence and studies. **Disclaimer**: I am not an expert in this field, I am just an [average joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myPRqz04iPw) and I like to combine information quickly in a readable manner for everyone to see. Many studies are incomplete, and some have great margins of error, so please be note and weary of that. Lots of data in this come from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and mainly reference a [summary from this very lengthy report done by the academy](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2)^1 in 2006. They also come from both British, American, Australian, and International sources.  



#Water fluoridation 



It is a process done in mainly [western countries](http://www.frot.co.nz/wapf/wapf_images/map.2.green.950b.jpg), most especially in the United States **for the purposes of public health to combat tooth decay**, particularly in children. Water fluoridation is done to help create a ""modern standard"" for teeth, especially since [America is infamous for always having clean teeth](https://thedentalexpress.com/how-early-americans-took-care-of-their-teeth/).^2,3,4 



In fact, **America makes up the *vast* ~~majority~~ plurality of fluoridated citizens worldwide**, [according to the Center for Disease Control itself](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2014stats.htm). Out of the 435 million people worldwide drinking water actively fluoridated by government, more than 200 million of them are in the United States. 



###Here are some statistics on populations of the fluoridated citizenry as of 2014, according to the CDC link: 


Group | Diagnostic 
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:| 
| Total US population, persons                                                             | 318,857,056 | 
| US population on community water systems (CWS), persons                                 | 284,099,832 | 
| Total US population on fluoridated drinking water systems, persons                      | 211,393,167 | 
| Percentage of US population receiving fluoridated water                                 | 66.3%       | 
| Percentage of US population on CWS receiving fluoridated water                   | 74.4%       | 
| Number of CWS providing fluoridated water                                               | 18,186      | 
| Number of CWS adjusting fluoride                                                        | 5,919       | 
| Number of CWS consecutive to systems with optimal fluoride levels                       | 6,015       | 
| Number of CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above optimal levels            | 6,205       | 
| Population served by CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above optimal levels | 11,883,007  | 



###And that was just the national level. Let's take a look at it state by state:

It's not a surprise that the CDC actually [prides itself](http://archive.is/ZQXW) in water fluoridation, saying that it is one of the ten greatest public health achievements in United States History. 



###Now back to the rest of the world 


Dental hygiene and cavities remain a [public health concern^5 for 60-90% of children^6 in industrialised countries^7, along with adults](http://www.who.int/oral_health/media/en/orh_cdoe_319to321.pdf)^8. Water fluoridation may be a solution to this, and [according to the United Kingdom, there are no adverse effects of this](https://www.york.ac.uk/media/crd/crdreport18.pdf)^9, but that has been [disputed over the years](http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v192/n9/full/4801410a.html)^10 by academia. The process by which public drinking water is fluorided has shown to cause [dental fluorosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis)^11. Australian government health councils have noticed this but [say that it is ""not a public health concern""](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/Eh41_Flouridation_PART_A.pdf).^12




However, there are some problems associated with the benefits and buffetings done by water fluoridation by government; in fact, evidence has shown in Europe^13 to have little influence over tooth quality in adults, but major differences in children. Many countries in Europe have experienced [substantial declines](https://www.wda.org/wp_super_faq/european-countries-have-rejected-fluoridation-so-why-should-we-fluoridate-water) in tooth decay^14 even without its use, even to the point where it may be unnecessary due to personal choices to keep up with dental hygiene. 



#Government standards and practices 



*For the purposes of this to let me add many links quickly, some of the links quoted here are not shown in the reference table (works cited) found below. Please refer to the reference table for citations in the footnotes above*.  



In 2011 the World Health Organization [suggested a level of fluoride from **0.5 to 1.5 mg/L**, tailored to climate, locality, and other sources of fluoride](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-153.1-157.147). To avoid repetition in referencing, please refer to [this gigantic document released by the World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf) concerning international standards for the practice of water fluoridation. It took a very long time for me to read. 



As of 2012, [25 countries have actively participated in water fluoridation, 11 of them have more than half of the population drinking water](http://bfsweb.org/onemillion/onemillion.htm) with *dangerous* amounts of fluorine^15, the health effects I will list below. 



In the United States, [the CDC has also provided a national table guideline for how fluoride should be placed in the water](http://archive.is/lvKz). It is *yet again* an extremely lengthy document, so brace yourself and grab some coffee (hopefully without sodium fluorine). 


Included in that bible-sized document are some very important [tables](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039178.htm#00001289.htm):

###Here are some of the chemicals frequently added to 63% of the US population's drinking water according to the CDC: 




* Sodium Fluoride. (NaF), the US Government administers 1/5th of a lethal dose per liter of water. 



* Fluorosilicic acid. (H2SiF6), which is expensive to transport. This one is most frequently used by the United States. **It is also a byproduct of fertilizer**. 



* Sodium fluorosilicate. (Na2SiF6), it is easier to ship. 




[References, there are five of them that each contain lengthy files concerning the content and how it is administered](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-5491.0-5699.36). The references are tedious to repeat, but nevertheless, **I have them below in the works cited table as references 16-20**. 




Also I will admit that I found this (the following) [on Wikipedia](http://archive.is/lP7V3#selection-1019.0-1027.204) and it is rather concerning: 



> Although fluoride was once considered an essential nutrient, the U.S. National Research Council has since removed this designation due to the lack of studies showing it is essential for human growth, though still considering fluoride a ""beneficial element"" due to its positive impact on oral health. 



And perhaps the scariest find of them all, [from the CDC again](http://archive.is/Eu1A), saying that: 



> .....optimal level of fluoride to range from **0.7 to 1.2 mg/L**..... 



Okay, now on to some more stuff. 




###Safety concerns and hazards 



There have been many cases of fluoride accidents resulting in illness and death in state populations in the past, particularly in the 1990's. Such cases can cause severe vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. One such case was in 1992 in Alaska, where 262 people became ill and one person passed away. Another incident in 2010 in [Asheboro, North Carolina, where 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water in 90 minutes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100704054308/http://www.myfox8.com/news/wghp-asheboro-fluoride-release-100629,0,2164002.story). 




#Health effects and experimentation 


Experimentation with both low and high concentrations of fluoride in water among native and eastern societies shows that **fluoride in drinking water has a significantly high impact on IQ**. 



I will mainly be referencing [this study](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2), done by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Also, remember and recall the [World Health Organisation's standards regarding fluoride levels](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf) and implementation; keep that in mind as you read my remarks on the study. [For those of you who have trouble loading PDF's, here is an archived link to an html of the same document](http://archive.is/PcaXR). Since the study is very lengthy containing several chapters, I mainly reference the summary but also some elements of chapters 1, 2, and 7. The study contains more chapters, especially very concerning ones about fluoride drinking water's effects on the endocrine system in chapter 8, but I may save that for another time. 



The reasoning behind the study was actually because of the EPA: 



> In response to EPA’s request, the NRC convened the Committee on Fluoride in Drinking Water, which prepared this report. The committee was charged to review toxicologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data on fluoride— particularly data published since the NRC’s previous (1993) report—and exposure data on orally ingested fluoride from drinking water and other sources. 




Furthermore, this is the scary part, particularly recalling earlier in this post when I referenced the safety levels of fluoride: 



> Overall, the committee found that the contribution to total fluoride exposure from fluoride in drinking water in the average person, depending on age, is 57% to 90% at 2 mg/L and 72% to 94% at **4 mg/L**.



So clearly for above-average water drinkers like me, I'm getting a very large dose of this stuff. 



Musculoskeletal concerns: 




> There were few studies to assess fracture risk in populations exposed to fluoride at 2 mg/L in drinking water. The best available study, from Finland, suggested an increased rate of hip fracture in populations exposed to fluoride at concentrations above 1.5 mg/L. 




Keep in mind that those bone fractures only occurred at 1.5 or 2 mg/L, when above average people like me get 4 mg/L. 




Skeletal fluorosis: 



> Skeletal fluorosis is a bone and joint condition associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of fluoride. Fluoride increases bone density and appears to exacerbate the growth of osteophytes present in the bone and joints, resulting in joint stiffness and pain. The condition is categorized into one of four stages: a preclinical stage and three clinical stages that increase in severity. The most severe stage (clinical stage III) historically has been referred to as the “crippling” stage. At stage II, mobility is not significantly affected, but it is characterized by chronic joint pain, arthritic symptoms, slight calcification of ligaments, and osteosclerosis of the cancellous bones. Whether EPA’s MCLG of 4 mg/L protects against these precursors to more serious mobility problems is unclear.




Gastrointestinal and other organ systems: 



> The committee also considered effects on the gastrointestinal system, kidneys, liver, and immune system. There were no human studies on drinking water containing fluoride at 4 mg/L in which gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or immune effects were carefully documented. Case reports and in vitro and animal studies indicated that exposure to fluoride at concentrations greater than 4 mg/L can be irritating to the gastrointestinal system, affect renal tissues and function, and alter hepatic and immunologic parameters. Such effects are unlikely to be a risk for the average individual exposed to fluoride at 4 mg/L in drinking water. However, a potentially susceptible subpopulation comprises individuals with renal impairments who retain more fluoride than healthy people do.  



###And finally, chapter 7 of the entire study [concludes effects on neurological and IQ systems](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/9): 



A lengthy description of the experiment and study: 



> Several studies from China have reported the effects of fluoride in drinking water on cognitive capacities (X. Li et al. 1995; Zhao et al. 1996; Lu et al. 2000; Xiang et al. 2003a,b). Among the studies, the one by Xiang et al. (2003a) had the strongest design. This study compared the intelligence of 512 children (ages 8-13) living in two villages with different fluoride concentrations in the water. The IQ test was administered in a double-blind manner. The high-fluoride area (Wamiao) had a mean water concentration of 2.47 ± 0.79 mg/L (range 0.57-4.50 milligrams per liter [mg/L]), and the low-fluoride area (Xinhuai) had a mean water concentration of 0.36 ± 0.15 mg/L (range 0.18-0.76 mg/L). The populations studied had comparable iodine and creatinine concentrations, family incomes, family educational levels, and other factors. The populations were not exposed to other significant sources of fluoride, such as smoke from coal fires, industrial pollution, or consumption of brick tea. Thus, the difference in fluoride exposure was attributed to the amount in the drinking water. Mean urinary fluoride1 concentrations were found to be 3.47 ± 1.95 mg/L in Wamiao and 1.11 ± 0.39 mg/L in Xinhuai. Using the combined Raven’s Test for Rural China, the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of the children in Wamiao was found to be significantly lower (92.2 ± 13.00; range, 54-126) than that in Xinhuai (100.41 ± 13.21; range, 60-128). **The IQ scores in both males and females declined with increasing fluoride exposure**. .....A study conducted by Lu et al. (2000) in a different area of China also compared the IQs of 118 children (ages 10-12) living in two areas with different fluoride concentrations in the water (3.15 ± 0.61 mg/L in one area and 0.37 ± 0.04 mg/L in the other). The children were lifelong residents of the villages and had similar social and educational levels. Urinary fluoride concentrations were measured at 4.99 ± 2.57 mg/L in the high-fluoride area and 1.43 ± 0.64 mg/L in the low-fluoride area. IQ measurements using the Chinese Combined Raven’s Test, Copyright 2 (see Wang and Qian 1989), showed significantly lower mean IQ scores among children in the high-fluoride area (92.27 ± 20.45) than in children in the low-fluoride area (103.05 ± 13.86). Of special importance, 21.6% of the children in the high-fluoride village scored 70 or below on the IQ scale. For the children in the low-fluoride village, only 3.4% had such low scores. Urinary fluoride concentrations were inversely correlated with mental performance in the IQ test. Qin and Cui (1990) observed similar negative correlation between IQ and fluoride intake through drinking water.



[Here is Figure 7-1, showing females](https://www.nap.edu/openbook/030910128X/xhtml/images/p200111b7g207001.jpg); and [here is Figure 7-2 showing males](https://www.nap.edu/openbook/030910128X/xhtml/images/p200111b7g207002.jpg). 



Furthermore, referencing another study inside of this one: 



> Spittle (1994) reviewed surveys and case reports of individuals exposed occupationally or therapeutically to fluoride and **concluded there was suggestive evidence that fluoride could be associated with cerebral impairment**. A synopsis of 12 case reports of fluoride-exposed **people of all ages showed common sequelae of lethargy, weakness, and impaired ability to concentrate regardless of the route of exposure**. In half the cases, memory problems were also reported. Spittle (1994) described several of the biochemical changes in enzymatic systems that could account for some of the psychological changes found in patients. He suggested that behavioral alterations found after excessive exposure could be due to the disruption of the N-H bonds in amines, and subsequently in proteins, by the production of N-F bonds (Emsley et al. 1981). This unnatural bond would distort the structure of a number of proteins with the collective potential to cause important biological effects. Fluorides also distort the structure of cytochrome-c peroxidase (Edwards et al. 1984). Spittle also noted the likelihood of fluoride interfering with the basic cellular energy sources used by the brain through the formation of aluminum fluorides (Jope 1988) and subsequent effects on G proteins.



Even furthermore, on the topic of silcofluorides which may even contain lead: 



> Another issue that has been raised about differential effects of silicofluorides comes from the dissertation of Westendorf (1975). In that study, silicofluorides were found to have greater power to inhibit the synthesis of cholinesterases, including acetylcholinesterase, than sodium fluoride (NaF). For example, under physiological conditions, one molar equivalent of silicofluoride is more potent in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase than six molar equivalents of NaF (Knappwost and Westendorf 1974). This could produce a situation in which acetylcholine (ACh) accumulates in the vicinity of ACh terminals and leads to excessive activation of cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. At high concentrations, agents with this capability are frequently used in insecticides and nerve gases. At intermediate concentrations, choking sensations and blurred vision are often encountered. Modifications of the effectiveness of the acetylcholinergic systems of the nervous system could account for the fact that, even though native intelligence per se may not be altered by chronic ingestion of **water with fluoride ranging from 1.2 to 3 mg/L, reaction times and visuospatial abilities can be impaired**. These changes would act to reduce the tested IQ scores. Such noncognitive impairments in children were reported in a meeting abstract (Calderon et al. 2000), but a full publication has not been issued. Extended reaction times have been associated with impaired function of the prefrontal lobes, a behavioral change not directly tied to alterations in IQ (Winterer and Goldman 2003). Because almost all IQ tests are “time-restricted,” slow reaction times would impair measured performance.




It can also be linked to Dementia due to the way that fluorides react with certain minerals in the body which produces a severe impact on cerebral metabolism: 



> For more than 30 years it has been known that Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a substantial decline in cerebral metabolism (Sokoloff 1966). This original observation has been replicated many times since then. The decrease is reflected in the brain’s metabolic rate for glucose, cerebral rate for oxygen, and cerebral blood flow. In terms of reduced cerebral blood flow, the reduction found in Alzheimer’s patients is about three times greater than in patients with multi-infarct dementia. **As early as 1983, Foster et al. (1983) demonstrated a general decline in the rate of utilization of glucose with the marker F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose with a positron-emission tomography scan. Recently, over and above the general decline in aerobic metabolism, several patterns of enhanced decreases in energy utilization have been demonstrated**. The temporal, parietal, and frontal regions are areas with some of the greatest reductions (Weiner et al. 1993; Starkstein et al. 1995). It is possible that the decline in glucose utilization is an early sign of the onset of dementia (Johnson et al. 1988; Silverman and Small 2002). In addition there is evidence from a number of sources that alterations induced by Alzheimer’s disease can be observed in many body regions and in blood. This indicates that the disease has *system-wide* effects in the body. One system particularly sensitive to carbohydrate utilization is the collection of areas involved with the synthesis of **ACh**. The release of this transmitter is also negatively affected by the interruption of aerobic metabolism and the effect can be noticed in the projection fields of the cholinergic systems. **Fluoride produces additional effects on the ACh systems of the brain by its interference with acetylcholinesterase**.



Furthermore, concerning aluminum and how it reacts with fluoride that may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's: 



> ....Because of the great affinity between fluorine and aluminum, it is possible that the greatest impairments of structure and function come about through the actions of charged and uncharged AlF complexes (AlFx). In the late 1970s and through the early 1990s there was considerable interest in the possibility that elemental aluminum was a major contributing factor to the development of dementia of the Alzheimer’s variety as well as to other neurological disorders. In a study of more than 3,500 French men and women above the age of 65 (Jacqmin et al. 1994), *a significant decrease in cognitive abilities* was found when their drinking water contained calcium, aluminum, and *fluorine*. 



Neurochemical effects of fluoride in drinking water in animals that may be similar to humans: 



> Fluoride has been shown to decrease the activities of superoxide dismutase (Guan et al. 1989) and glutathione peroxidase (Rice-Evans and Hoschstein 1981), the consequences being increased free radicals.




> ....NaF injected subcutaneously into rabbits altered brain lipid metabolism (Shashi 1992b) and concentrations of protein, free amino acid, and RNA in the brain (Shashi et al. 1994).



###Further findings by the study: 



> In assessing the potential health effects of fluoride at 2-4 mg/L, the committee found three studies of human populations exposed at those concentrations in drinking water that were useful for informing its assessment of potential neurologic effects. These studies were conducted in different areas of China, where fluoride concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 4 mg/L. Comparisons were made between the IQs of children from those populations with children exposed to lower concentration of fluoride ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg/L. The studies reported that while modal IQ scores were unchanged, the average IQ scores were lower in the more highly exposed children. This was due to fewer children in the high IQ range. While the studies lacked sufficient detail for the committee to fully assess their quality and their relevance to U.S. populations, **the consistency of the collective results warrant additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence**. Investigation of other mental and physiological alterations reported in the case study literature, including mental confusion and lethargy, should also be investigated.



> ....On the basis of information largely derived from histological, chemical, and molecular studies, **it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain** and the body by direct and indirect means. 



There you go, the National Academy is recommending the EPA to do something about this. Too bad that the EPA doesn't have power to control it, only to regulate the content. The CDC controls the substances and administers them to the drinking water. 



Please take note of all methods of proof, verification, and sources and make note of many disclaimers associated with the use of these studies, along with the disclaimers inside of the studies concerning the material. 



Have a wonderful day.

2,There was a massive amount of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary. We've witnessed the coordinated installation of a nominee against the will of the people.,747.0,6f3t7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6f3t7n/there_was_a_massive_amount_of_election_fraud/,177.0,1496527455.0,"Whether you're a fan of Debbie Lusignan's commentary or not, she put together a very in-depth blog in real-time, state-by-state, chronicling massive amounts of election fraud. Everything's covered;

-Voter Roll Purging (State by state... see Brooklyn alone, where over 125,000 people were seemingly kicked off the rolls. This nationwide phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to potential Sanders voters.)

-Unsolicited Party Affiliation Switching (Lifelong Dems being switched to Lib, Repub, or Independent in closed primaries by the thousands. In one of the more eggregious primaries, AZ, their SOS even testified under oath that this had occured in unprecedented numbers. As above, this phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to Sanders voters.)

-Caucus Rigging (The shenanigans in Iowa and especially NV should have caused more outrage than they did.)

-Absentee Ballot Stuffing (See Wyoming and Montanta for extreme examples of this.)

-Unparalleled Precinct Slashing (This occurred in many states with once again AZ being a prime example. Polling locations were cut to record lows. Lines stretched into the thousands and wait times were documented to be upwards of 4-6 hours in certain counties.)

-Auditing Anomolies (See the results and testimony before the Election Board following the Chicago micro-audit.)

Historic Exit Poll Discrepancies (In 12 states, the discrepancies were well outside of the margin of error and in some cases in the double-digits. These discrepancies were almost entirely exclusive to the Sanders/Clinton race, with everything else matching up within the margin of error as expected. Look at the difference between the exit polls in the Republican Primary versus the Democratic... it's night and day. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that after the exit poll anamolies started to gain serious traction, they were eliminated in each state for the remainder of the primary. Independent exit polls were conducted in the states where official ones were cancelled and often showed massive discrepancies in regards to the official outcome... see CA.)

-Voter Database Breaches (This happened during a few key points pre-primary and during; the AZ breach being the most significant. Though unproven, many election integrity activists theorize that this is the means in which probable Sanders voters were unmasked and targeted for roll purges and affiliation switches.)

-Electronic Voting Machines (Ever since HBO's Hacking Democracy expose aired and bolstered recently by the work of Bev Harris at blackboxvoting dot org, the continued use of electronic voting machines, many of which have been banned in Europe at this point, is highly irresponsible. These machines have proven to be susceptible to remote hacking and provide no paper trail. In fact, there is proprietary software built into the machines themselves with the sole purpose of fractionally weighting the votes to meet a predetermined outcome. See Bev Harris' Fraction Magic mini-doc on youtube to see this exposed in real time. Whether or not this exploitiation was employed is up for debate, but by design this software leaves no evidentiary paper trail, making confirmation one way or the other next to impossible.

Then there is the outright underhandedness. While not necessarily fraud, ethics and fairness do come into serious question.

-Everything in the Wikileaks DNC and Podesta dumps. (This has all been thoroughly covered here.)

-Historically Minimal Debate Schedule (DNC originally only sanctioned 6 debates. Sanders/Clinton ended up having 9, but compare that to 08' when Clinton/Obama faced off 26 times.)

-Near Media Blackout for Sanders during 2015 and into 2016. (In terms of minutes of pre-primary MSN news coverage an estimated 327 minutes went to Trump, 121 minutes to Clinton, and a mere 20 minutes for Sanders despite his surging momentum.)

-Media Bias (To say that the MSM wasn't in the tank for Clinton would be the understatement of the year. See The Washington Compost's 16 hit pieces they ran in one day leading up to Super Tuesday II. Not to mention the media and pundit collusion well documented in the Wikileaks dumps.)

-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held ""open"" primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.

-Super Delegates (The fact that we willfully accept the notion that the vote of indivduals in positions of power count for much more than ours is baffling to me. It's this entirely undemocratic process that saw Clinton walk away with the same amount of pledged delegates as Sanders in a state like Wyoming that healthily won; with SD's included, Clinton walked away from that state, in a losing effort, with an 11 to 7 delegate advantage. Though this ties into media bias, it's worth mentioning that in nearly all MSM coverage, SD's were lumped in with pledged delegates whenever totals were presented to the public, even though SD's didn't cast their votes until the convention. To new and low-information constituents, this deceptive reporting gave the impression that Clinton's lead was always more significant than it actually was; this was done for the seemingly sole purpose of demoralizing the Sanders voting block and stifle upward momentum. As Al Franken pointed out, he felt that due to his political experience he knew what was best for his constituents and would cast his SD vote for Clinton despite his state going for Sanders. Franken was just one of many Reps and Senators that gave the middle finger to the will of their constituency.

-Rallies (Though this is more of a speculative side topic, it can't be ignored. From August 15' through June of 16', even when Sanders had no delegate path to victory, his rallies were attended by hundreds of thousands of indivuals, often filling stadiums to maximum capacity. In contrast, HRC could barely fill a broom closet, let alone a high school gymnasium. Sure, she had a handful of decent turnouts early on, but those number dwindled as the primary carried on, while Sanders' numbers surged in every conceivable way. In one her final rallies in L.A., there were more people protesting outside than HRC supporters inside. Looking at the gross disparity here, something just doesn't pass the smell test.

TL;DR - There was election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary, likely massive, if not an outright coup.

* [i_reddit_for_lulz archive 4](https://archive.vn/jU2Qn#selection-9259.25-9259.29). Same thread as in the above archive but missing some comments.

Here is why he seems to have predicted covid:

> You say the event around 2020 will change the world in hours or minutes, but suggest the elite will have plenty of time to get situated underground

> i_reddit_for_lulz: Not exactly, around 2020 an event will happen that will change the way we live. In my research this doesn't seem to be the event that will change our lives in minutes or hours. I don't see that coming until a bit later.

Covid obviously started in 2020 and changed the way we lived.

> It's in 4 years, realistically what kind of event could happen? All out war? A super plague? Nuclear warfare?

> i_reddit_for_lulz: Less than 4, actually 3 years 3 months. But the exact as if it will be plague, war, etc., are not 100% for certain because that depends on many factors.

He mentions plague as a specific possibility and also gives an exact date of in 3 years 3 months. He made the above comment on October 2, 2016, and 3 years and 3 months after that is January 2020. Covid was first identified and confirmed to transmit between humans in January 2020, and while the first cases appeared in December 2019, they were labeled as pneumonia in that month.

> i_reddit_for_lulz: I would just say, keep your eyes and ears open approaching year 2020. Sometime during that time events will occur. Not enough to destroy the earth time, but enough to unravel certain ways of living, or fear of not having a certain way of living.

Covid unraveled the way we lived and people were afraid of being stuck living at home and not being able to live their normal lives.

> i_reddit_for_lulz: The standards people have been used to, especially in America. Things that have always been taken for granted, and also the ways people treat people just because they have ""stuff"". This will become unraveled.

After covid, people stopped caring about celebrities.

In regards to Yellowstone and comets, he said the ""event that will change our lives in minutes or hours"" will come after covid and one of the events will be geological and the other will be celestial in nature. They will also occur around the year 2020, which includes 2021. The reason for July in specific is because /u/Throawaylien, an alleged alien abductee, [said that his abductors have been planning something big for July 18, 2021 for several years now](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/nk2x4q/july_18_and_hoaxers), and Biden's vaccination goal ends on July 4 and covid restrictions will be lifted in England on July 19, so next month could be considered ""after covid"" in a few countries at least. The reason I think the geological event will be Yellowstone and the celestial event will be comets is because there are prophetic visions that specifically mention these disasters. From a [near death experience conference in 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337849365_Prophetic_Visions_in_Near-Death_Experiences_Warnings_for_our_current_times_-_youtubeRf4H_1Yqf4g):

> … the next thing I was shown involved a huge explosion coming from the area of Wyoming or Montana 
[Yellowstone supervolcano?]. A giant mushroom cloud forms above the explosion and a ring of white 
clouds that stays close to the ground expands across the continent all the way to the East coast, as all life is 
extinguished.

> A comet will strike the earth. I think it will hit in China because I see what appears to be Chinese writing on 
signs and vehicles where it strikes. … The largest pieces [of the comet] strike the ground with enough force that 
they throw up mountains of dirt, dust, debris, and smoke that blocks out the sun. … Sometime [later] there will 
be worldwide earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes. I also see a period of winter that will be brought on by all 
the dust in the air. This winter last for a couple of years causing worldwide starvation.

Wyoming and China are also two of the three locations that Throawaylien mentioned as being part of the July 18 plan. It's likely that these events will not be natural if they occur, because i_reddit_for_lulz said the disasters would be man-made and Throwaylien's abductors have been planning for the events for several years in advance, which only makes sense if they are going to trigger them.

As far as West Africa goes (the third location Throawaylien mentioned), July 18 lands on [the holiest day in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Arafah) this year and in the middle of the Mecca pilgrimage, so I think the aliens could be playing the religion card and sweeping through the Muslim countries from west to east while declaring the natural disasters to be ""God's judgement"" upon the US and China. July 18 also happens to be the [ninth of Av](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av) this year, which is a day of fasting and mourning for the Jewish people. It coincides with many disasters in the Jewish timeline (and our timeline), including the destruction of the first and second temples, the death of over 580,000 Jewish civilians in 135 CE at the hands of the Romans, the entrance of Germany into World War I, and the start of the holocaust. Israel is near Mecca, so who knows what is planned for Israel. i_reddit_for_lulz also said that central Africa would be safe from extinction events for whatever reason.

This also all connects to the book of Revelation. Revelation 6:12-17:

> 12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and there came a great earthquake; the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood, 13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter fruit when shaken by a gale. 14 The sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. 15 Then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 16 calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; 17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”

""sun became black as sackcloth"" will be caused by ash from the volcanic eruption and dust from the comets.

""the stars of the sky fell to the earth"" will be the the comets hitting China.

""the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains"" will be everyone fleeing to the secret underground bases i_reddit_for_lulz talked about. According to /u/i_reddit_for_lulz, the bases have farms and factories and enough food and water for to last for centuries.

**June 22-23, 2001**: ""The [*Dark Winter*](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events-archive/2001_dark-winter/) exercise, held at Andrews AFB, Washington, DC, June 22-23, 2001, portrayed a fictional scenario depicting a covert smallpox attack on US citizens.""

**January 14, 2005**: ""[Atlantic Storm](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020090646/http://www.atlantic-storm.org/about.html) was a ministerial table-top exercise convened on January 14, 2005 by the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the Johns Hopkins University, and the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network. The exercise used a fictitious scenario designed to mimic a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond to a bioterrorist attack.""

""During the six hour meeting, the transatlantic leaders wrestled with the enormity and rapid pace of the emerging epidemics of smallpox, the tension between domestic politics and international relations, the challenge of controlling the movement of people across borders, and an international shortage of critical medical resources such as smallpox vaccine.""

""In the Black ICE scenario six terrorists from South Asia self-infect with smallpox and, while they are at their most contagious, travel by air to Central Asia. During their travel and upon arrival, the terrorists infect as many people as possible with the disease. National response capabilities are quickly overwhelmed and governments call upon international organizations for assistance in areas such as disease diagnosis and interventions, public health and law enforcement investigations, coordinating transportation policies, and managing displaced populations.""

(Page 18)

""During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified."" (Page 19) 

""In developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: **biometric IDs for all citizens**, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests."" (Page 19)

""Going direct means the central bank finding ways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders. Going direct, which can be organised in a variety of different ways, works by: 1) bypassing the interest rate channel when this traditional central bank toolkit is exhausted, and; 2) enforcing policy coordination so that the fiscal expansion does not lead to an offsetting increase in interest rates. 

An extreme form of 'going direct' would be an explicit and permanent monetary financing of a fiscal expansion, or so-called helicopter money."" (Page 2)

""...in a downturn the only solution is for a more formal – and historically unusual – coordination of monetary and fiscal policy to provide effective stimulus."" (Page 8)

""Any additional measures to stimulate economic growth will have to go beyond the interest rate channel and 'go direct' – when a central bank crediting private or public sector accounts directly with money. One way or another, this will mean subsidising spending – and such a measure would be fiscal rather than monetary by design. This can be done directly through fiscal policy or by expanding the monetary policy toolkit with an instrument that will be fiscal in nature, such as credit easing by way of buying equities. This implies that an effective stimulus would require coordination between monetary and fiscal policy – be it implicitly or explicitly."" (Page 8)

Anything from pellet/bb guns to really big stuff and everything imaginable in between. You cannot fathom how many guns people is these states possess. 

Biden/Harris have stated they plan a mandatory buy-bavk of AR15s and similar guns.

Whether or not you agree with this sentiment, this will absolutely cause civil war in the US and potentially lead to international war with US soil as a war theater.

As a rule, gun owners will not comply with with a buy-back. If the White House doesn't back off at this point, the next recourse would be an **attempt** to use our armed forces against gun owners. 

This will then 100% result in shots fired, and not in small quantities. We're not talking about small groups of rednecks tatare ""bitter clingers"". Just do a search of per capita gun ownership by state. Gun owners are a huge percentage of every state.

https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/guns-per-capita

*Wyoming, just one state (and the highest) has an average of 229.24 guns per capita.*

If, looking at these numbers, our Pentagon refuses to strong arm the American people, and the Biden/Harris admin still won't back down, they next recourse is to involve the UN. There us only one nation with military personnel in suffecient numbers to take the US to task. China. 

And Biden just happens to be connected closely with that nation. 

This nation also owns a big chunk of this platform, so I fully expect to be brigaded with downvotes and naysayers. That's cool. 

Whether not you support gun ownership, this is *the issue* that will lead to war and probable destruction of our land if it is pushed. 

I'm mainly just laying this out so that people can be ready. You may want to leave the US for a few years or something if it starts building in this direction. I've made plans and I'm watching closely. I don't consider the US as worth fighting for. Its been basically one big mental institution for the last decade as far as Im concerned. There's a great big world out there and I'm sure sure place for me somewhere if it comes to that.

One user, /u/Throawaylien, said that he has been abducted multiple times in [his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r034d/alien_abductees_of_reddit_or_people_who_have/cdikpd2/), going as far back as 1987. He said the following about next month:

> They will make contact with Earth on a wide scale in 2021. That's the year when they'll land here, or colonize, or whatever. I'm not exactly sure what their plan is.

> The whole ""program"" or whatever they call it is going to change in July, 2021. I think they said 8th, but it could also have been 18th, I wasn't hearing very well.

Then a couple of weeks ago, he came out of the woodwork and gave an [update in /r/aliens](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/nk2x4q/july_18_and_hoaxers/). He reaffirmed his July prediction, but added some new details:

> Whatever was planned for July is still going to happen so far as I know, but it has definitely changed. Something changed and I’m pretty sure that’s why this report is coming out, but I can’t be sure about that. I’ve heard Friends talking about a report for years and years but I didn’t know it would happen this way. I don’t know if the report that’s coming out is to prepare us or if it’s just a cover up. I don’t know what it all will be on the 18th, either, except that Gina 2 and the Friends of Friends are leaving and someone else is coming and that whatever will happen on Earth is not colonization. I’ve seen maps up there and it looks like on the 18th something will happen at least in western Africa, something in maybe China or around China, and in Wyoming or Colorado or Utah. It’s hard for me to know where stuff is just looking at maps without the state and country borders on them but none of the maps up there have any of those lines so I’m making educated guesses on those three spots.

u/Throawaylien has many skeptics, understandably. Some people believe that he is schizophrenic, but people with schizophrenia are usually way less coherent. [Here is an interview with an actual schizophrenic for comparison.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1L9Rb0LADg) It is also understandable that /u/Throawaylien's mental health would decline, considering that he was abducted and tortured by the US government (allegedly) for his comment from seven years ago. He also learned that his alien abductors were not as benign as he thought. It was his impression that they didn't kill people, but they do in certain experiments.

There are also claims that /u/Throawaylien is a larp or troll. Another famous user, /u/TheTraveler3649, came out as a larp, and some people claimed that /u/Throawaylien and /u/TheTraveler3649  had the same IP address, but proof for such was never delivered.

Either way, if aliens do appear in July, then they are almost for sure related to /u/Throawaylien's abductors. They are also most likely the Orion group as described in the [Ra Material](https://www.lawofone.info). This is because /u/Throawaylien's statements match up almost directly with the Ra Material, which I outline [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/nknveh/megathread_regarding_throawaylien_and_traveler/h1awmq5/). What the Ra Material consists of is a set of transcripts and audio recordings containing channeled communication with an ET called Ra. The experiment was conducted in the 80s by Don Elkins, a physics professor and UFO investigator. If aliens do appear next month, then /u/Throawaylien's statements are all the credence the Ra Material needs, but here are a couple of accurate scientific predictions that the Ra Material has made:

* Ra evolved on Venus over two billion years ago. [In 2019, a paper came out stating that Venus may have been habitable 2 to 3 billion years after it formed](https://www.space.com/planet-venus-could-have-supported-life.html), which would be 1.5 to 2.5 billion years ago given that Venus is 4.5 billion years old.

* Ra said the Great Pyramid was used to channel energy via resonance. In 2018, scientists discovered that [the Great Pyramid collects and concentrates electromagnetic energy](https://www.electrooptics.com/news/great-pyramid-giza-can-focus-electromagnetic-energy-study-shows-which-could-enable-new-sensors).

The Orion group, i.e. /u/Throawaylien's abudctors, are essentially the dark side, as they have been abducting our people, secretly working with our governments, creating class hierarchies, maintaining class disparity, and keeping the general population ignorant. The ""others"", as /u/Throawaylien's abductors refer to, is the Confederation, which is a coalition of fifty-three civilizations including Ra. The Confederation is the light side and aids lifeforms throughout the galaxy as they are able to.

**Further evidence**

/u/Throawaylien's statements and the Ra Material are not the only evidence that aliens will appear next month. There are a bunch of coincidences that point to July and the year 2021 as being the time of the aliens. The [UFO report](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ufos-are-make-way-us-senate-know-rcna973) that is being delivered to Congress this month is one obvious example, but here are some less obvious examples:

* In 1321 when the last Cathar Perfect was burned at the stake, he prophesized, [""In 700 years the laurel will become green again, good people will return""](https://anaiyasophia.com/blog/cathar-prophecy-light-of-the-world). 1321 + 700 = 2021. If the Orion group does in fact leave and the Confederation returns, whom came  before to build the pyramids, then the ""good people"" will have returned. The Cathar Perfects were Christian gnostics, and they believed that the Gods of the Old Testament and New Testament were not the same God. This is in-line with the Ra Material, which states that the Old Testament was negatively influenced by the Orion group, more so than the New Testament.

* Four months ago, a post titled [Is anyone else getting told a cycle is coming to an end, things are about to change as you know it, you will be reborn, or is it just me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarot/comments/l4lk56/is_anyone_else_getting_told_a_cycle_is_coming_to/) was posted in /r/tarot. Many of the users concurred with OP. Tarot is valid according to the Ra Material.
* There have been many recent posts from /r/Psychic regarding aliens and big upcoming changes:

 * [Strange sense of imminent change](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nnddh9/strange_sense_of_imminent_change/). Many users concurred with OP.

 * [Has anyone dreamed of a mass Alien visitation or large UFOs in the sky recently?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nktt45/has_anyone_dreamed_of_a_mass_alien_visitation_or/)

 * [Aliens? Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nl6g0c/aliens_why/) This one mentions July specifically.

 * [feeling about aliens.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nkyr3d/feeling_about_aliens/)

 * [Strong Feelings of imminent change in June and July](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nuuwil/strong_feelings_of_imminent_change_in_june_and/)

 * [Alien dreams again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/nwa5sd/alien_dreams_again/)

* The former Israeli space security chief said that [a Galactic Federation is in contact with the US and Israeli governments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weird-news/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-extraterrestrials-exist-trump-knows-n1250333) and that they are waiting for the right time to reveal themselves. The Confederation is also known as the Galactic Federation.

* July 18 is [the ninth of Av](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av), which is an annual day of fasting and mourning for the Jewish people. The date varies, so it can even be in August sometimes. Here are some of the disasters that occurred on the ninth of Av:
  * The destruction of the First Temple and Second Temple.
  * The death of 580,0000 Jewish Civilians in 135 CE after Rome quashed the Bar Kokhba revolt.
  * The entrance of Germany into World War I, which set the stage for World War II and the Holocaust.
  * The start of the Holocaust.

* [There are astral projection users](https://www.tiktok.com/@carlamxrie/video/6965928788614057222) that believe a galactic war in the astral realm ended recently. The Orion group and Confederation have been at war in higher dimensions for millennia.

**My Prediction**

The Ra Material and other channeled communications with ETs have seen exponential growth in the past few years. More and more people are awakening, and if the Orion group did lose to the Confederation in higher dimensions, then their hourglass is running low. Thus, I'm predicting that they'll stage first contact next month to establish the narrative and gain supporters before it's too late. They can't simply tell us that they have been working with our governments for decades, otherwise no one will trust them. The upcoming UFO report is simply the first step of their scheme. Once it comes out, the US government can say something like ""let's try to make contact with whoever is behind the UFOs"" and then magically succeed in the following month. Or the Orion group can simply park their ships over our cities for all to see and claim that they heard about the report and wanted to show themselves. They may even claim to be from the Confederation. Seeds for this have already been planted given the former Israeli space security chief's comments.


To gain a following, my guess is the Orion group will take advantage of religion, as they were responsible for some of the revelations and miracles in the Old Testament according to Ra. They can project angels in the sky or even make a hologram of Jesus if they really want to. This is why the ninth of Av will mark the beginning of another disaster for the Jewish people: they're not going to accept the fake messiah. The Orion group may also utilize the power of our governments to gain control over the population. Now that there is more evidence that covid came from a lab, and given that /u/Throawaylien's abductors work with China, it is possible that covid was an experiment in government control.

The reason I don't think the Confederation is coming even though u/Throawaylien says his abductors are leaving is because the Confederation only appears if the majority of people are aware of their existence and consent to their arrival or if the circumstances are dire. Neither of which will be the case next month. They will hopefully show up later if enough shit goes down.

**Connections to the book of Revelation**

For those of you who are Christian, connections can be made with all of this and the book of Revelation. The first half of chapter 12 talks about how the dragon lost a war in heaven against Michael and his angels. This sounds like the Orion group losing to the Confederation in the astral realm recently. The dragon is symbolic for the serpent and the Devil, and the Orion group is certainly devilish considering all their activities on Earth. Dragons are also reptiles, and the Orion group is reptilian in appearance according to Ra. In the second half of chapter 12, the dragon makes its last stand on Earth, and this is what the Orion group will be starting next month.

In chapter 13, the second beast could be the Orion group, the US, and/or China. The second beast will perform miracles that make people worship the image of the first beast. The Orion group could easily do this with its technology and paranormal abilities, and they are definitely interested in getting people to follow and obey a system of some sort. The first beast is the antichrist, so it has to represent Christ or the church in some way. The Orion group will claim to be the second coming and then label whoever opposes them as the antichrist, e.g. the Confederation.

**Objections from those who study the Ra Material**

People who study the Ra Material will object and say that the Orion group cannot make an appearance because that would violate the law of free will, which all higher beings are incentivized to obey. The following would indicate that they can in fact carry out the plan I have described above:

* From https://www.lawofone.info/s/16#2: ""Thus, in order to balance the dimensional variances in vibration, a quarantine was set up, this being a balancing situation whereby the free will of the Orion group is not stopped but given a challenge.""

* From https://www.lawofone.info/s/16#9: ""The first instance is, in the long run, shall we put it, more salubrious for the Orion group in that it does not infringe upon the Law of One by landing and, thus, does its work through those of this planet. In the second circumstance, a mass landing would create a loss of polarization due to the infringement upon the free will of the planet. However, it would be a gamble. If the planet then were conquered and became part of the Empire, the free will would then be re-established. This is restrained in action due to the desire of the Orion group to progress towards the One Creator. This desire to progress inhibits the group from breaking the Law of Confusion.""

Ra also says that prophecies of doom are corrupt, but even in the timeline he gives, there are cataclysmic events, such as the destruction of Maldek.

**tl;dr /u/Throawaylien, an alleged alien abductee, said that his abductors were planning something big for July 2021. In addition to the upcoming UFO report, there are many coincidences that also point to July as being prime for ""first contact"".**",conspiracy,Wyoming

Probably related, in her book, *Tranceformation of America*, Cathy O'Brien explains how high level politicians play a hunting game called “A Most Dangerous Game” where they either hunt men or hunt little kids in a military enclosed wilderness.

https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/87570/16/OBrien%2C_Phillips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America.html

> Dick Cheney had an apparent addiction to the ""thrill of the sport."" He appeared obsessed with playing A Most Dangerous Game as a means of traumatizing mind control victims, as well as to satisfy his own perverse sexual kinks. My introduction to the game occurred upon arrival at the hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming, and it physically and psychologically devastated me. I was sufficiently traumatized for Cheney's programming as I stood naked in his hunting lodge office after being hunted down and caught. Cheney was talking as he paced around me, ""I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two legged dear. Or I could stuff you with this (he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis) right down your throat, and then mount you. Which do you prefer?

> Blood and sweat became mixed with the dirt on my body and slid like mud down my legs and shoulder. I throbbed with exhaustion and pain as I stood unable to think to answer such a question. ""Make up your mind,"" Cheney coaxed. Unable to speak, I remained silent. ""You don't get a choice, anyway. I make up your mind for you. That's why you're here. For me to make you a mind, and make you mine/ mind. You lost your mind a long time ago. Now I'm going to give you one. Just like the Wizard (of Oz) gave Scarecrow a brain, the Yellow Brick Road led you here to me. You've 'come such a long, long way' for your brain, and I will give you one.""

> The blood reached my shoes and caught my attention. Had I been further along in my programming, I perhaps would never have noticed such a thing or had the capability to think to wipe it away. But so far, I had only been to MacDill and Disney World for government/ military programming. At last, when I could speak, I begged, ""If you don't mind, can I please use your bathroom?""

> Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the cartorid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled, ""If you don't mind me, I will kill you. I could kill you --Kill you --with my bare hands. You're not the first and you won't be the last. I'll kill you any time I goddamn well please."" He flung me on the cot-type bed that as behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.

We live in clown world, so most people will see that this goes against the media narrative, so they will discount it without looking into the merits/evidence of the argument. Ignorance is a choice. I choose to post this here because of the optics of it as well as the fact that r/conspiracy is one of the last bastions of free speech on Reddit.

Well, there is no perfect way to say this, so here it is: We’re fucked. Our economy is fucked and there is no way out except to let it burn to the ground. They have to let it burn to the ground. How do I know this? They’ve done it before.

March 2020 the stock market starts to crash. They say that it’s because of COVID. But it never was.

We never fixed the problems of leverage that caused the 2008 crash. Quoting from the beginning of this article below; [https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/a-self-fulfilling-prophecy-systemic-collapse-and-pandemic-simulation/](https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/a-self-fulfilling-prophecy-systemic-collapse-and-pandemic-simulation/)

“In pre-Covid times, the world economy was on the verge of another colossal meltdown. Here is a brief chronicle of how the pressure was building up:

June 2019: In its [*Annual Economic Report*](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2019e.pdf), the Swiss-based Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the ‘Central Bank of all central banks’, sets the international alarm bells ringing. The document highlights “overheating \[…\] in the leveraged loan market”, where “credit standards have been deteriorating” and “collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have surged – reminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations \[CDOs\] that amplified the subprime crisis \[in 2008\].” Simply stated, the belly of the financial industry is once again full of junk.

9 August 2019: The BIS issues a [working paper](https://www.bis.org/publ/work804.pdf) calling for “unconventional monetary policy measures” to “*insulate the real economy* from further deterioration in financial conditions”. The paper indicates that, by offering “direct credit to the economy” during a crisis, central bank lending “can replace commercial banks in providing loans to firms.”

15 August 2019: Blackrock Inc., the world’s most powerful investment fund (managing around $7 trillion in stock and bond funds), issues a [white paper](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019.pdf) titled *Dealing with the next downturn*. Essentially, the paper instructs the US Federal Reserve to inject liquidity *directly* into the financial system to prevent “a dramatic downturn.” Again, the message is unequivocal: “An unprecedented response is needed when monetary policy is exhausted and fiscal policy alone is not enough. That response will likely involve ‘going direct’”: “finding ways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders” while avoiding “hyperinflation. Examples include the Weimar Republic in the 1920s as well as Argentina and Zimbabwe more recently.”

22-24 August 2019: G7 central bankers meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to discuss BlackRock’s paper along with urgent measures to prevent the looming meltdown. In the [prescient words of James Bullard](https://www.ft.com/content/360028ba-c702-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0), President of the St Louis Federal Reserve: “We just have to stop thinking that next year things are going to be normal.”

15-16 September 2019: The downturn is officially inaugurated by a sudden spike in the repo rates (from 2% to 10.5%). ‘Repo’ is shorthand for ‘repurchase agreement’, a contract where investment funds lend money against collateral assets (normally Treasury securities). At the time of the exchange, financial operators (banks) undertake to buy back the assets at a higher price, typically overnight. In brief, repos are short-term collateralized loans. They are the main source of funding for traders in most markets, especially the derivatives galaxy. A lack of liquidity in the repo market can have a devastating domino effect on all major financial sectors.

17 September 2019: The Fed begins the emergency monetary programme, pumping hundreds of billions of dollars per week into Wall Street, effectively executing BlackRock’s “going direct” plan. (Unsurprisingly, in March 2020 the Fed will [hire BlackRock](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/fed-hires-blackrock-for-agency-cmbs-corporate-debt-programs) to manage the bailout package in response to the ‘COVID-19 crisis’).”

Just like in 2008, we kicked the can and blamed COVID. However, in 2008, kicking the can involved turning on the money printer. And now it is stuck in the ON position. As of this writing, if we do not change anything we are doing, the money printing will no longer outpace inflation as of March 2022.

Our legislators, on this current episode of the Dog and Pony show, are having a very public temper tantrum about raising or suspending the debt ceiling. Here’s the rub. We are heading towards economic collapse due to money printing, fiscal policy, over-leverage, etc. If we don’t raise the debt ceiling, we risk economic collapse. So either way we are going to have an economic collapse.

Put yourself in the mindset of someone in the position of power. You’ve been a career politician for the last 40 years of your life. You’ve passed laws that have benefited your campaign donors. You’ve capitulated the minimum necessary to the general population as to prevent a common folk revolt. Now your chickens have come home to roost. Your sins against the American Dream must be atoned for.

So now you sit here with a three pronged choice.

1. Stop the money printing that is leading to inflation. (Powell has said that its not the time to start tapering)
2. Let it all collapse organically. (the issue with this is that the crimes of the wealthy will be on full display for everyone to see)
3. Use your best scapegoat for the collapse. (The Debt ceiling fight)

I believe that using a scapegoat is the most obvious and easiest way “out” of this mess. No one expects a default, which is exactly why it’s time for us to default on our obligations and start to unwind this whole clusterfuck of global debt. After all, the model of scapegoating works; the most recent test of it being March 2020.

IDK what comes next, but I know that my investments should make me enough money to disappear if needed. There is a lot of pain coming to a lot of people and I take zero pleasure in that, no matter how much money I'm about to make.

Help who you can if you have the means and take care of those you love. If you make money off of this coming collapse, tell no one.

P.S. Someone ironed the wrinkles in my brain, so in conclusion, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm not giving financial advice no matter how many folks ask. I super appreciate all the engagement and comments, but I'm in no position to give financial advice to anyone. I'm just someone who sees a fuse lit and traveling towards a massive pile of dynamite (the economy) so I'm warning as many people as I can. I do not have any solutions to the woes that are about to plague the vast majority of folks. I wish everyone the best, but again, not giving any financial advice.",conspiracy,Wyoming

In 2004 Cheney and Bush  exempted all the ""Gas Fracturing"" extraction companies from the clean water act and the superfund cleanup act and simultaneously leased them a huge percentage of all the BLM Public land in the country.

Now they have built thousands of fracture wells injecting extremely harmful cancer causing chemicals into the ground and ground water  in all those public lands to break up the earth so the natural gas would be able to flow back to the well head and be extracted.

The effect has been -unsurprisingly- huge seepages of all those injected chemicals - which by the way NEVER will break down - all the way back up into ground water, wells and even surface streams where literally you see film of many many people lighting their faucet water on fire and streams bubbling up with the gases that also can be lit on fire. (the effect in the movie is hard to exaggerate - literally people's faucet water exploding in their sinks on camera in multiple states.

These are also causing pollution fog clouds in these otherwise nearly pristine areas so the air quality in some of this public land is now worse than in Los Angeles.

Some of the people who have breathed those ground hugging clouds are in the hospital and suffered permanent whole body systemic breakdowns.

There have been animal kills as well.

This is across multiple states in the southwest and Wyoming - huge areas of land. HUGE.

Some homeowners in these states have been supplied with reverse osmosis water filters for the wells which the underground injected chemicals simply eat through the membranes of. Others have had water trucked in.

The area of pristine land from northern Pennsylvania and further that supplies all the fresh water to New York city and Philadelphia has also been leased to these same people but as of now they have not built any fracture wells ... yet (as of the movie filming in 2010 - they are probably RACING to do it now so If I lived in NYC I 'd be screaming for an injunction and stop fast).

You can't possibly truck in enough water to replace that water supply to New York city and Philadelphia. There isn't enough fresh water anywhere to do it.

There is no known way to get those chemicals that have been injected into the ground in all those states back out of the ground or stop them from moving around under ground since they have fractured all the barrier rocks layers underground to get to the natural gas.

The areas of poisoned land just since 2004 is so immense it is staggering and because most of it was BLM land given by Bush it used to all be the cleanest area in the country and is now the most polluted and poisonous. 

THAT is why the gas companies are so desperate for you not to see this movie.

The damage is so immense and the damaging intent and fore knowledge of the damage it was going to cause was so clear (that's why they were exempted from the clean water act and the superfund act) that is defies belief that Cheney and Bush and corporate leaders shouldn't be brought up on charges of intentional terrorism and poisoning of essential national water supplies. Honestly if a person had poisoned one one hundredth of the water supply Cheney and Bush intentionally and with fore knowledge PERMANENTLY poisoned that person would be tried and put to death as a terrorist like in Oklahoma City or Guantanemo.

It staggers belief and the damage and scale is even worse than the gulf Oil spill which is hard to imagine.

And that is why they don't want you to see that film GasLand.

Let's take a look at a little background history on aliens and the government:

>In July 1947, the radar at the Four Corners area in the southwestern United States effected and took down an alien disk.

It was entirely an accident. The disk landed near Roswell, New Mexico. It was to be the first of two disks that would crash in that area. On board, scientists and military personnel found several dead alien beings.

An immediate analysis of their species could not be determined, but the aliens had both *reptilian and insect-like qualities*. Also on board were found the remains of several military personnel.

As far as we know, this was the first major indication that human beings were being taken by an alien species.

Within two years, the government would run into another case on the *White Sands Missile Range* where Sergeant **John Louette** would be abducted right in front of a witness by a disk that hauled him aboard with tentacle-like cables. His body was found three days later about ten miles from where he was taken.

This is all described in [the Grudge 13 report](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mj12_3o.htm).Military and intelligence forces seized the Roswell disk and took it and the bodies to Los Alamos. It is estimated that the government has had in its possession at least 35 disks and 131 alien bodies over the last 45 years. They also have captured several live entities.In 1949, another disk crashed, with one fatality and one living alien, whom they kept in a facility with an electromagnetic grid to ensure the isolation of the entity.

The entity, whom [MJ-12](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mj12.htm) member **Detlev Bronk** termed an **EBE** (*Extra-terrestrial Biological Entity*) and later **ALF** (*Alien Life Form*).Since technological superiority also means superiority in military and intelligence circles, it was decided by the government that it would be to their advantage to communicate with the aliens and possibly acquire advanced technology. They also wanted to find out more about both the aliens and the role they were playing in mutilations and abductions of humans and animals.In 1952, the government created several special agencies to help with the problem. The *National Security Agency* ([NSA](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_nsa.htm)) was created especially to deal with the aliens.

Together with the NSA and the CIA, the *National Reconnaissance Office* (NRO) and *Delta Security forces* completely took over all aspects of alien and disk interaction.One of the projects created in 1952 was *Project Sigma*, which was a joint NSA/CIA project that had as its objective communication with alien species.

The project was successful, and after communications sponsored through *Project Plato* (establish diplomatic relations), [a meeting was held between elements of the US Government and the species known as **the Greys** on April 25, 1954 at 6 pm at Holloman AFB](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/exopolitica/esp_exopolitics_Q.htm). Two disks hovered above the runway while a third landed.Thousands of feet of motion picture film were taken of the event, and in the 1980's, producer **Linda Howe** was contacted by Special Agent **Doty** of the *AFOSI* with a proposal to use some of the film in an HBO documentary.

The government reversed its position later on, citing political reasons.At the meeting at Holloman, a hostage was exchanged.

The name of the US hostage is not known, but [the alien hostage was known as Krlll](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_krllpapers.htm) (no vowels), who was confined to an electromagnetically secure facility near Los Alamos.At one of the meetings between the government and *the EBAN*, as they called themselves, a treaty was negotiated. The government was aware that *the EBAN* had a part to play in both the mutilations and the abductions, and probably hoped to find a way to eventually stem the tide of these activities.

The EBAN told the government that their abductions of humans were for medical examination purposes. It wasn't until later that the government realized that *the EBAN* were lying to them.The agreement was made, and contained some of the following provisions:The United States would not reveal alien presence and would not interfere with alien operations.

The United States would allow the aliens to maintain underground bases. Old AEC underground facilities were some of the initial facilities to be offered, although larger facilities were built at 26 locations around the southwest.

The United States would allow the aliens to abduct its citizens on a periodic and limited basis for medical examination, providing that the people were returned unharmed and without memory of the interaction.

The aliens would furnish a periodic list of abductees. This list would be reviewed by the National Security Council.

The aliens would provide the United States with technology in beam weaponry, gravitational propulsion and mind control and implant technology. (Implant technology was in use as early as 1964 and legalized in Sweden by Olaf Palme)It was estimated by scientists that the alien culture was at least 50,000 years ahead of ours. We even had our own scientists that were transferred to the alien world to study it.

AFOSI Special Agent **Doty** [said](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_projectSERPO.htm):""We have research scientists studying their planet like they study ours""...Sometime after the government made the agreement with the aliens, they began to suspect that the aliens were abducting a larger number of people than reported to the NSC on the lists.

The government wasn't so concerned about the animal mutilations, only the actions that involved humans. They also realized they had made an error in trusting the aliens and that they couldn't do anything about it - yet anyway.So, the aliens had violated the agreement. There was also an awareness in the government of what the aliens were really doing with the people they abducted. There was apparently little they could do but try and keep the information classified to prevent panic.

In December 1988, former Navy intelligence officer [**William Cooper**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_cooper.htm) interviewed a man who said,""I don't know everything, but it's way out of control. To tell you the truth, I'm afraid of what's going to happen.

Giant underground shelters are being built under Groom Lake and in other places.""At that time, in December 1988, there were other ""leaks"" that began to surface.

It was said that the government tried to make contact with another group of aliens, allegedly [the Reptilians](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/reptiles/reptiles.htm) (who are apparently advancing on this system), because they were one of the few enemies of [the Greys](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_18za.htm) who could get rid of them.

The communication was done from the huge underground communications facility outside Datil, New Mexico in February of 1989.

At the same time, at Los Alamos, scientists were phasing down the SDI program and continuing work on *Project Excalibur*, which involved nuclear missiles capable of penetrating 1000 meters of hard soil.

They were equipped with a 1 megaton warhead, and were proposed for use on the [underground EBE bases at Dulce, New Mexico](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_offlimits.htm), and others in the four corners area.A new, more disturbing rumor began to surface. It said that the government had already developed an anti-matter weapon at Los Alamo National Laboratories, and would detonate it above the surface of the Earth, killing all life and destroying the atmosphere and water if the Reptilians would not help us get rid of the Greys.

Evidently, *other races use the Earth as a way station for natural materials* and this was thought to be a good way to induce them to help us.

There is no word on what the reply might have been.The government decided to step up its public acclimation program, and the media began to feature more and more programs and concepts having to do with alien contact, trying to get the public prepared. It was thought by researchers that the government would stage its own controlled ""UFO"" landing in order to finally break the ice on the matter.

Part of the acclimation program was the release of information simultaneously by the Soviet Union and the United States press about the landings in the Soviet Union that took place on September 27th, 1989.

The use of the Soviet Union is apparently a tactic of [MJ-12](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mj12.htm).

Shortly after that, the radio talk shows in the western United States began buzzing with discussions of all facets of the alien problem.There is no doubt that the government policy of secrecy makes the ""harvests"" easier for the Greys. Governments, by definition, are supposed to protect the public welfare. Obviously, something went very wrong here, and it appears that the Nazi SS intelligence-based CIA had a lot to do with it.

One might note that alien related projects, such as those to test and fly captured alien disks and maintaining bases and ""the other space program"" require a lot of money. In 1949, there was virtually no heroin addiction in the United States.

**Lucky Luciano** was allowed to return to Italy around that time to start up the heroin processing labs in return for his help to the government during the invasion of Italy during the war. Heroin began flowing into the United States in the 1950's, and it provided a good start for the massive addiction problem we have today.

**Bo Gritz**, one of America's most decorated heroes, recently wrote a book called ""[A Nation Betrayed](http://www.amazon.com/Nation-Betrayed-James-Gritz/dp/B000J56J6U/ref=sr_1_3/002-0871848-1563234?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180110885&sr=8-3)"".

In it he details that when he went over to Southeast Asia to investigate the POW problem, he discovered that *the United States Government is the largest purchaser and distributor of heroin and cocaine in the world*.

Primarily, the **CIA** and the **Delta security forces** (sponsored by the *National Reconnaissance Office* at Fort Carson, Colorado ) are involved.

The process appears to serve two purposes:To eliminate weaker elements of societyTo provide funds for alien-related and space projectsIn 1987, a Los Angeles police officer was killed when he discovered that the top floor of a hotel (name withheld) in Los Angeles was used as a CIA heroin/cocaine distribution point.

Other points exist out of Riverton, Wyoming and on the Laguna Indian Reservation in Arizona. So much for the ""Just Say No"" program. Who was in charge of the CIA during the greatest increase in activity in these programs?. Wake up, planet Earth!Dr. **Carl Jung**, famous psychologist, wrote a letter to Major **Keyhoe** one time about the UFO problem. In it, he said, "" nothing helps rumors and panics more than ignorance. It is self-evident that the public ought to be told the truth"".

Even **Abraham Lincoln** had something to say about the American people and truth,""I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended on to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.""

There is a lot more that is behind all these events, but we will cover some of that later. For more historical data, refer to the 'Chronology' in the *Appendix* in the back of the book.

But instead of warning everyone two months in advance. What if the scientists......doesn't? What if the government gives no warning of the eruption, and just deals with the aftermath after it blows? Here are two scenarios.

**Scenario #1:** The US gives a formal warning that Yellowstone will erupt in approximately two months. Thus, starting a logistical nightmare of evacuating 3.3 million people from the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. That is not including all the other millions outside the kill zone. We're talking about one the biggest mass migrations in recorded history. Counties will close their borders to try and stop American Refugees. These countries will have there own problems with preparing than taking on refugees. Like the giant ash cloud that will engulf the globe and kill 90% of life in the coming years. 

**Scenario #2:** Yellowstone seismographs gets increasing activity. Instead of releasing this info to the public. They put up fake graphs to not cause panic. When the volcano erupts, they won't have to deal with people in the kill zone. Outside countries won't have enough reaction time to close borders, thus more places for refugees. It may seem very cynical to think this, but in the government's eyes, this could be a legit plan. Even with the higher death toll. It will be easier to evacuate the smaller batch of people, especially when more countries take in refugees. 

**TLDR:** The government will not warn the people of the eruption, because it will logistically easier to handle the smaller size of survivors. ",conspiracy,Wyoming

Summary – Going Direct Reset


By John Titus

The “novel” coronavirus pandemic marks the greatest turning point in U.S. monetary history since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. In large measure, the “novel” coronavirus pandemic narrative serves as a convenient cover story that distracts from and even masks the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented maneuvers in 2020—maneuvers that happen to have been planned and discussed in August 2019 some four months prior to the first mention of any “novel” virus in Wuhan, China.

What marks the Fed’s maneuvers in March 2020 as unprecedented really is not its sudden creation of $3.5 trillion in reserves; that amount, $3.5 trillion in a few weeks, was unprecedented to be sure, but that’s merely a matter of degree: the Fed created over $1 trillion in the space of a few short weeks back in September 2008 during the global financial crisis (GFC). In that light, and purely in terms of reserves, the Fed’s sudden creation of $3.5 trillion beginning in March 2020 wasn’t novel at all; it was merely bigger than what it had done starting in 2008.

No, what made the Fed’s 2020 pandemic maneuvers novel was what the Fed did with its new reserves: it disbursed them so as to cause the parallel, mirror-image creation of $3.5 trillion in new bank money. That simply did not occur during the GFC. This is the defining feature of the Fed’s 2020 pandemic maneuvers. To understand this, however, requires at least rudimentary knowledge of the split-circuit debt-based monetary system1 that’s in place in nearly all parts of the world (the exceptions all coming, curiously, in “anti-USA” flavors like the Taliban, Libya, etc.).

To be clear up front, what creates the need for two separate circuits of electronic money is the fact that all electronic money is created as debt. The electronic money we use as ordinary people is created by commercial banks when they lend money. Commercial banks are different from other financial institutions and businesses in that they create “money” out of thin air when they lend it. Other entities (ordinary financial institutions and businesses as well as people) are dispossessed of the money they lend out.

When “we” lend, it only changes the composition of assets on our balance sheets. A $100 loan to a friend only changes the asset side of our balance sheet, where the entry of “$100 in cash” gets replaced by “$100 IOU from Tom.” The liability side of our balance sheet remains the same.

This is not so with commercial banks. The asset side of their balance sheet isn’t amended at all—it is supplemented with the $100 IOU from Tom. When a commercial bank lends out $100, the asset side of its balance sheet increases by $100. The liability side increases by $100 as well, when Tom’s electronic checking account is increased by $100 in new “money.” That “money” is actually (and legally) an IOU from the commercial bank to Tom. The commercial bank simply creates a $100 IOU electronically, which is credited to Tom’s account. The commercial bank isn’t dispossessed of any money in this transaction. This is what distinguishes commercial banks from everyone else.

This is easy enough to understand, but it doesn’t explain why two separate circuits of electronic money are needed. To understand why another circuit needs to be added, we need to consider the things that Tom might do with his new $100 account money. One of those things, and this is what necessitates the addition of a second monetary circuit, involves the transfer of some or all of the new $100 to another commercial bank—call it Bank B (Tom’s bank being Bank A). This might occur if Tom proposes to pay Jerry $100, and Jerry banks with Bank B.

Because the $100 in Tom’s account is legally an IOU from Bank A to Tom, Bank B is not—without more inducement—going to willingly take on Bank A’s IOU as its own. Bank A would be perfectly fine with that proposal, as it would convert $100 of liability into $100 of equity and thereby fatten Bank A’s bottom line. Contrawise, however, Bank B’s liabilities would increase by $100 and its equity would be reduced by $100. So without more of an incentive, Bank B would simply refuse the transfer of Tom’s $100 account at Bank A to Jerry’s account on the liability side of its own balance sheet.

To make the transaction work, i.e., for Bank B to add $100 to the liability side of its balance sheet, Bank B is going to need a counterbalancing sweetener; that is, Bank B is going to need $100 added to the asset side of its balance sheet at the same time.

There are any number of ways that Bank A could make this happen. Bank A could send over to Bank B $100 in cash. That way, Bank B’s balance sheet would increase by $100 on both its asset side (with $100 in new cash) and its liability side (with $100 in Jerry’s account). However, cash is physical and slow, when what’s really needed is electronic and fast.

And this is where reserves come into the picture. Reserves are electronic IOU money too, but the issuer of reserves cannot be a commercial bank because commercial banks’ IOUs are liabilities, when what is needed to make the transaction work is an electronic asset.

The issuer of reserves is a central bank. They issue (electronic) reserves out of thin air just like commercial banks issue (electronic) bank money out of thin air. And reserves are IOUs just like bank money is an IOU. Only the “I” and the “U” in IOU are different. With bank money IOUs, the “I” is a commercial bank and the “U” is anyone who banks with (has an account at) a commercial bank.

With reserves, the “I” is the Federal Reserve and the “U” is anyone who banks with (has an account at) the Fed, including commercial banks. Just as commercial bank IOUs are money (an asset) to us, Fed IOUs are money (an asset) to commercial banks.

Whenever bank money, then, is transferred from one customer at one commercial bank to a second customer at a second commercial bank, what really goes on is this (using Tom and Jerry as our example): one, Bank A deletes $100 from Tom’s account; two, bank B adds $100 to Jerry’s account; three, Bank A transfers $100 in reserves to Bank B.

Now, let’s turn back to what made the Fed’s “pandemic” response in 2020 different from its response to the GFC starting in 2008. As mentioned, the Fed created over $1 trillion in new reserves starting in September 2008, and it created $3.5 trillion in new reserves starting in March 2020. Viewed just in light of reserves, the difference between the GFC and the pandemic insofar as the Fed is concerned is merely one of degree: the banking system got more sudden new reserves in 2020 than it did in 2008.

However, the bank money circuit is another story altogether, and this is what makes 2020 novel. Whereas there was no new bank money created starting in September 2008 (when the Fed created over $1 trillion in new reserves), in March 2020 there was $3.5 trillion in new bank money created (when the Fed simultaneously created $3.5 trillion in new reserves).

Put in different terms, in 2008 the Fed’s creation of wholesale money (reserves) did not occasion the parallel creation of new retail money (bank money), whereas in 2020, the Fed’s creation of wholesale money caused the parallel creation of an essentially matching amount of retail money.

This duality is reflected in the Fed’s monetary data. Wholesale money is shown in blue (digital liabilities on account at the Fed), and retail money (cash plus bank money, or M2) is shown in green.2



Figure 1: The fundamental difference between the GFC (big gray bar) and the pandemic (small gray bar) is the use of reserves to lever up retail money (green line) in 2020, which did not occur during the GFC.

To understand the mechanism used by the Fed to effect the parallel increase of retail money in response to new reserves in 2020 but not in 2008, see the author’s video, “Quantitative Easing Is the Biggest Sham Ever,”3 which walks through the transaction structures used to pull off this David-Copperfield-like feat of financial legerdemain.

The magnitude of the Fed’s shift in monetary policy in 2020 is remarkable all by itself, to be sure. For the first time ever, the Fed used its power to create new reserves in the wholesale monetary circuit to effect the parallel creation of new bank money in the retail circuit, and it did so to the tune of about $3.5 trillion.

But there is something else about the Fed’s actions in 2020 that makes them independently remarkable in a truly breathtaking way: while the Fed insisted throughout this episode that the extraordinary actions it took were all emergency measures necessitated by the onset of an alleged virus pandemic beginning in December 2019, the irrefutable fact of the matter is that the Fed’s novel and extraordinary acts were carried out in accordance with the plan presented to the Fed on August 22, 2019—four months before anyone had ever heard of SARS-CoV-2.

What’s more, this plan was presented to the Fed by BlackRock, which the Fed later appointed to assist the Fed in executing the $3.5 trillion plan. To put it bluntly, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve starting in March of 2020—actions that represented a massive departure from the Fed’s responses to crises before that time, as we have just seen—are exactly what BlackRock told the Fed to do in Jackson Hole, Wyoming over half a year before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. It was in August 2019, months before the first coronavirus story broke, that BlackRock instructed the Fed to get money into wholesale and retail hands when “the next downturn” arrived—which, as luck would have it, occurred less than a month later.

This was, in its essence, BlackRock’s “going direct” plan,4 and it anticipates exactly what the Fed began doing—quite successfully—under the cover of the pandemic. Thus, when the WHO officially declared the onset of the pandemic, it provided perfect cover for the Fed to implement BlackRock’s plan, under which the Fed effected the creation of $3.5 trillion in retail bank money to buy low-yielding bonds from the Fed’s billionaire buddies, who then turned around with the proceeds and put them to work in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and high-flying stocks.

In a nutshell, the arrival of the 2020 pandemic was about as accidental as an assassination. The pandemic narrative is nothing but a cover story to conceal from the public what in reality is the biggest asset transfer ever.

     In North America the principal ecological- network driver is the Wildlands Project. Launched in 1991, the initiative aims to protect and restore the natural heritage of North America through the establishment of a connected system of “wildlands”, that is “reserve networks” compris- ing core areas, corridors and buffer zones (Noss, 1992). This is to be achieved through:

     • conserving a representative system of native ecosystems;
     • maintaining viable populations of all native species in their natural habitats;
     • maintaining ecological and evolutionary processes;
     • ensuring adequate resilience of ecosys- tems and species.

     The Wildlands Project operates by promoting the ecological-network concept, advancing method- ologies and providing support to regional and local initiatives. This support comprises scientific research, conservation-planning methodologies and promoting partnerships with grassroots and national conservation organizations, government agencies, indigenous peoples, private landowners, naturalists, scientists and conservationists (see, for example, Soulé and Terborough, 1999). The following Wildlands projects have progressed to the preparation of a complete plan:

     • Heart of the West Wildlands Network Design, located in the Rocky Mountains and developed in collaboration with several other NGOs, including the Wild Utah Project and the Biodiversity Conservation Alliance;
     • Southern Rockies Wildlands Network Design, developed in cooperation with theSouthernRockiesEcosystemProject and the Denver Zoo (see box);
     • New Mexico Highlands Wildlands Network Design, located at the juncture of the Rocky Mountains, the Great
Plains, the Chihuahuan Desert and the
Great Basin;
     • Sky Islands Wildlands Network Design,
covering parts of Arizona and New Mexico (in collaboration with Naturalia, a Mexican NGO, work is underway to extend the network into Sonora and Chihuahua as the Northern Sierra Madre Wildlands Network Design — see below);
     • Southern Appalachian Conservation Plan;
     • Oregon Coast Range Conservation Plan, completed in the early 1990s and covering a relatively small area.

Several more Wildlands initiatives are working to prepare a plan:

     • Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y), extending along 3,200 kilometres of the northern Rocky Mountains from Wyoming to the Arctic Circle and initiated in collaboration with the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (although the project has since become an independent entity) — see also Tabor and Locke (2004)
     • Northern Sierra Madre Wildlands Network Design, a project launched in collaboration with the Mexican NGO Naturalia
     • Grand Canyon, an initiative still in an early phase
     • Colorado Plateau, again an initiative that is in an early phase
     • Northern Appalachians Wildlands Network Design, an initiative launched by a coalition of US and Canadian part- ners covering the New England states, theAdirondackMountainsofNewYork, Nova Scotia, parts of Newfoundland, Ontario and Quebec.
     • Oceans of Grass Wildlands Network,
focusing on the plains of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Wyoming and
North and South Dakota 
     • Florida Conservation 2000, an initative • that has been taken over and revised by
the Florida Nature Conservancy and

     The work of the Wildlands Project focuses primarily on North America’s “megalinkages”, the continental-scale linkages that run north- south and east-west. Within each megalink- age, initiatives are taken to develop a cluster of ecological networks. For example, in the Spine of the Continent megalinkage running north to south from Alaska through the Rocky Mountains to Central America, six contiguous networks are under development: Yellowstone to Yukon, Heart of the West, the Southern Rockies, the New Mexico Highlands, the Sky Islands and the Northern Sierra Madre.
In addition to the work by the Wildlands Project, several other regional ecological-net- work initiatives are underway in North America.

37,12 Critical Events That Are Going to Happen Over a 40 Period From Aug. 21st to Sept. 30th (silvanuspublishing),48.0,6ulhfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ulhfm/12_critical_events_that_are_going_to_happen_over/,16.0,1503097203.0,"A whole lot going on. . .

""We are about to witness an extremely unusual convergence of events that many believe could represent a major turning point for our nation. 

By now you have probably heard that on August 21st a total solar eclipse will move across the entire continental United States for the first time in decades.  In fact, we have not seen a total solar eclipse cross from the west coast to the east coast in 99 years.  And it will be the very first total solar eclipse that is only visible in this country since the United States first became a nation.  Starting with that event, there is going to be a whole lot going on until we reach the end of September.  The following are 12 critical events that are going to happen over a 40 day period from August 21st to September 30th…

August 21 – The “Great American Eclipse” will sweep across portions of Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Seven years later, another very unusual total solar eclipse will move across our nation, and when you plot the paths of both eclipses on a map, they form a giant “X” right over the center of the United States.

August 23 – A FEMA exercise known as “EarthEX2017” will simulate “catastrophes such as mega earthquakes, cyber terrorism or high altitude electromagnetic pulse attacks”…

*An exercise sponsored by FEMA and the U.S. Department of Energy set to take place on August 23 called EarthEX2017 will wargame responses to catastrophes such as mega earthquakes, cyber terrorism or high altitude electromagnetic pulse attacks.
The exercise will simulate a “subcontinent-scale, long duration power outage, with cascading failures of all other infrastructures,” according to the official Earth Ex website.    
“Black sky events” are defined as, “Catastrophic occurrences caused by man or nature that bring society to its knees.”*

September 1 – This marks the start of FEMA’s annual “National Preparedness Month“.

September 1 – The U.S. State Department’s ban on U.S. citizens traveling into North Korea goes into effect.  Many are concerned that this is yet another sign that we are moving toward war with North Korea.

September 11 – This will be the 16th anniversary of 9/11.

September 20 – Rosh Hashanah begins at sunset.

September 21 – The UN International Day Of Peace

September 23 – This is the date of what has become known as “the Revelation 12 sign”.  If you are not familiar with this alignment yet, the following is a very brief summary…

*On September 23rd a unique astronomical alignment of the Sun, Moon, constellation Virgo, constellation Leo, and planets Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Venus is going to fulfill this passage from the book of Revelation:*

*And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.  She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.*

September 24 – Very important national elections will be held in Germany.

September 29 – Yom Kippur begins at sunset, and it concludes on
September 30th.  Of course September 30th will be the end of a 40 day period that began back on the day of the Great American Eclipse on August 21st.

September 29 – U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says that the debt ceiling will be breached on this day if Congress does not raise it by then.

September 30 – If Congress does not pass a budget by the end of this day, there will be a government shutdown just like we witnessed in 2013.

On top of everything else, the month of September is when the Federal Reserve is scheduled to begin unwinding  their 4.5 trillion dollar balance sheet…

During this time, I participated in several military exercises (to train and prepare for wartime scenarios) with one happening nearly every year.  This training included bomb-raid drills, chemical decontamination, security patrols, and even repairing simulated holes in concrete as if we were repairing the runway which had been bombed.

While this was fun (in a weird twisted way) it was by no means the only drills the military participates in.  While I was active duty, I was assigned to a team that traveled through 3 different states and participated in local disaster preparedness drills.  During these drills, I, as an actor, would be dressed up in moulage and placed in a scenario for the local police, fire departments, and ambulances to respond to.



**Scenario 1**

The first scenario I remember was the simulated carjacking and hostage situation on a greyhound-type bus which was parked in the fairgrounds of the town we were in.  There were at least two actors who were playing the bad guys and were going up and down the isle yelling/cussing at the passengers and pushing them around.  The police responded and eventually the bad guys ""gave up"".  There were no shots fired, nobody actually injured, or anything.  The paramedics arrived to ""treat"" the people on the bus.  I remember being loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled into one of the fairground buildings as a ""triage"" staging location.  After everyone on the bus was removed and ""treated"" the scenario ended.



**Scenario 2**

The stage for the next scenario was some sort of courthouse or city town center building.  All I remember about the building was that it was small, old, and had wooden floors throughout.  There was a staircase (which I was placed in) so it must've had multiple floors.  The stairs were wood too.  Anyhow, the scenario for this emergency preparedness drill was that there was a gunman who had entered this government building and shot up the place.  I was dressed in moulage and was supposed to be dead from a gunshot wound.  Really, they just put some red makeup on my shirt and made a hole in it but they didn't use any fake blood.



**Conclusion**

The military, local governments, hospitals, etc all participate in drills to test their preparedness should an emergency scenario happen.  It is a good training method for the personnel as they get to learn with a hands-on approach.  Yes, I was an actor and played an injured person.  The people ""treating"" me had no idea who I was.  There were cameras around and they were filming for other training purposes (perhaps even local news segments).



Ask me anything! :)
 
 

 

EDIT:

A few additional things I thought were important:

- As far as I know, all of the local emergency personnel were aware that they were participating in a drill and that everything is fake.  Obviously it wouldn't work for the hostage-takers if the police actually shot them for waving a fake weapon.
- None of our people were wearing military uniforms, it was all civilian clothing.
- I don't remember the town's names but the states were South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. (We swung back through the corner of North Dakota just to say we had been there too)

*January 8, 2017 / 5:09 PM*

NEWTOWN, Pa. -- A woman whose teenage daughter’s dismembered remains were found in the woods last fall has been charged along with her boyfriend with killing the girl in a “rape-murder fantasy” the couple shared, a prosecutor said Sunday.

“The hours and the days leading up to her murder were probably the most horrible and traumatic that any person should ever have had to experience,” Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said.

Sara Packer and Jacob Sullivan face charges including criminal homicide, rape, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse over the July death of 14-year-old Grace Packer, online court documents show.

On the morning of July 8, Grace, who had been adopted by Sara Packer, was taken to the attic of a house the couple rented, where she was beaten and then raped by Sullivan as her mother watched, an affidavit said. She was then poisoned, bound and gagged and left for dead, Weintraub said. 

When the couple returned hours later, they discovered Grace was still alive, so Sullivan choked her to death, Weintraub said. Sullivan told police it took much longer than he expected to strangle her, according to the affidavit. 

Investigators say the couple packed Grace’s body with cat litter to mask decomposition smells and stored it in the attic. Officials allege they dismembered the body in October after being scared by a police visit.

The girl’s torso was found by two hunters in a Luzerne County park on Oct. 31, and K-9 teams found the legs and arms nearby, the criminal complaint said.

Barbara Desmond has been a county social worker since 2007, but Wednesday she was charged by Greensburg police. 

Desmond told police she thought she fulfilled her obligation as a mandated reported by giving the victim’s family information on how to report the assault.

“She never made the report. It was made by somebody else but later it was learned she was aware that this incident did occur,” Greensburg Police Capt. Robert Stafford.

Desmond was made aware of the allegation because the suspect is her relative. 

Police said she was on a phone call with the victim's parents and the suspect.  Desmond allegedly told the victim's parents to let the suspect report it first to ChildLine, and if he didn’t, they could make the report themselves. 

But because she’s a mandated reporter, she was required to report it herself. 

**Question: mandated reporter(social worker) of child abuse FAILED to report ?! Then who else can all the victims turn to ? Yes. Bring all the evidence to investigative journalists.**

**Grandmother Saves Children From Alleged Abuse, Social Workers Blame Her Instead**

In was on Oct. 13 that Yolanda Bryant, 44, started to receive text messages from a family friend’s phone. It was her 10-year-old grandson. After some chit chat, the boy started to open up. He and his 5-year-old sister had been staying with the family friend for five months already. During that time, they hadn’t been to school. “He said, ‘We’re not allowed out the room,’” Bryant said. “He said they get beat with sticks.” Her heart sank.

“Can you get us?” the boy asked, texting from the phone he secretly took from the family friend. She explained that she couldn’t do that. She hadn’t had contact with her daughter for about two years. She didn’t even have her phone number. Getting the children out of there would mean getting custody through the family court.

“Can you do that,” he asked….

The workers are even authorized to remove children from homes without a court order in an emergency situation…  Not only did the DHS refuse to investigate the boyfriend or have the police investigate him, but it also claimed the children walked back all the allegations, Bryant said. She found that unbelievable….She still had the texts from the boy, too, but the DHS refused to collect the evidence, she said….

**Editor’s note: sketchy enough? “Social workers are authorized to remove children from homes without a court order.**” “**DHS refuse to investigate the boyfriend or have the police investigate him. the DHS refused to collect the evidence**”

The district sent a letter to parents warning that if they fail to pay their school-lunch debts ""you can be sent to Dependency Court for neglecting your child's right to food.”

A Pennsylvania school district that warned parents that unpaid lunch fees could lead to their children being placed in foster care rejected a businessman's offer to clear the debts, a Philadelphia CEO said.

La Colombe Coffee CEO Todd Carmichael said the Wyoming Valley West School Board's president on Monday told him ""no"" when he offered to give the district $22,000 to cover the outstanding debts.

Carmichael said in a letter obtained by NBC News that he received free meals at school when he was a child and was ""horrified"" when he heard of the threatening letters, which were sent to parents and demanded they pay up or risk having their children placed in foster care. The letters sent to parents were obtained by NBC affiliate WBRE of Wilkes-Barre.

It was not immediately clear why Carmichael's offer to pay the outstanding debts was reportedly refused. Multiple attempts by NBC News to reach the Wyoming Valley West School Board were unsuccessful.

**Question: That’s horrifying enough! Pay up School lunch debt or your children will go to foster care, You will never see them. And your children will be sexually abused, raped, abused and … That is definitely a blackmail and good threat. A kindhearted CEO offered to clear the lunch debt but the school district rejected at first.**

This is just my guess on how I think things have developed to get us to where we are today, and where they will be taking us.

Jeffrey Epstein was an Israeli intel, blackmail operation. Israel backed trump, he was suppose to lose to HRC as controlled opposition.

Deepstate cozied up to big tech, China, Iran, and the UN. Isreal was neglected so they crossed the old guard and deepstate. The US DOD was also not in the cabals’ future plans. UN Military was preferable. Big tech is also opposition to the DOD’s data collection.

Isreal allied with the US DOD (military industrial complex), handed Trump all the JE blackmail on Hollywood and DC. 

DOD’s biggest problem domestically is US intel agencies, FBI, CIA, NSA. (Deepstate). They monopolize black market trade, guns, drugs, humans. Launder money through the Vatican and foreign shell corps, back thru lobbiests and DC. Campaign funds. 

Trump gets in, removes blocks. Sets the stage. They shut down cartels, drugs, guns, human trafficking, all the black-op funding for intel agencies. Gather more dirt.

2020, covid baits the media, goal is to illustrate flow of foreign $ influence on US. TV, film, journalism, medicine, education. 

Antifa activated. funded by foreign $. Domestic terror threat.

DOD can’t go over the FBI, and CIA while trump is in. Rigged election gives cause. Leonardo SPA hack from the US embassy in Rome, via military satellites, under direction of US CIA. Trump expelled all legal options. Looks like he tried to correct the injustice. Was meant to fail in court. 

DOD will expose the crimes. Signal intercepted by Space Force. They will be hero’s, we’ll trust them to govern the “free and open internet” (FED NET)

What comes next?

Space X’s Starlink, global WiFi, defended by DOD via Space Force, DOD gets to collect the world’s data. This is why Big Tech overreached and censored. They’ll sell us on FED NET being the true internet for freedom of speach and all that bc it will allow people to bypass big tech censorship. 

Antifa will provide more riots and get squashed by the DOD, but will help pass new domestic terror bills, bills conservatives should oppose but they will applaud bc they’re “patriots”. 

The rigged election and human trafficking will provide cause for national ID system that conservatives should oppose, but will applaud bc think of the kids, and our election integrity. 

All of this bad stuff was funded with cash, so we can ban that while we’re at it and transition to blockchain which seems to be free and decentralized but the DOD probably already has quantum computers that fully neutralize any true hope decentralization lasting long term. They probably also developed bitcoin. The secure hash algo that the protocol uses as a cryptographic hash function is SHA-256, developed by the NSA in the early 90’s. 

I don’t think anyone really cares about stopping human trafficking, someone probably just wants to make it obsolete bc theyre in the cloning or ai sex robot business now, idk. 

But it’s a good thing Kanye switched to making gospel music and built a super church in the middle of Wyoming bc the world is going to have to do a lot of “healing”.",conspiracy,Wyoming

Goats that produce spider silk protein in their milk could enable researchers to collect large quantities of the silk. Image credit: National Science Foundation.

(PhysOrg.com) -- Researchers from the University of Wyoming have developed a way to incorporate spiders' silk-spinning genes into goats, allowing the researchers to harvest the silk protein from the goats’ milk for a variety of applications. For instance, due to its strength and elasticity, spider silk fiber could have several medical uses, such as for making artificial ligaments and tendons, for eye sutures, and for jaw repair. The silk could also have applications in bulletproof vests and improved car airbags.

He claims to have made contact with a group of government/military ‘insiders’ who oversaw some of these unacknowledged special access programs, and are now providing him with information to disseminate to the public. The caveat is that they want the information to come out gradually in small bits. 

The first installment is a 700-page historical fiction novel co-authored by DeLonge and AJ Hartley. 
>https://www.amazon.com/Sekret-Machines-Book-Chasing-Shadows/dp/1943272158

DeLonge is also about to release a documentary, the extended trailer for which was posted in an email from Tom DeLonge to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta. 
>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4804

In that leaked email, DeLonge says:
>I created this teaser as a way to open conversations and excite Spielberg's people. It worked. I just left my meeting at DreamWorks, and they are very, very interested.

The link he posted was viewable at the time the leaks dropped, but is now gone.
>https://vimeo.com/145495599

John Podesta himself is in the trailer and will be interviewed in the film. Having gone on the public record numerous times about the subject, Podesta has been very interested in what the US government and military industrial complex has been withholding about extraterrestrials and UFOs. 

While Tom DeLonge has been reticent to reveal his ‘insider’ sources, the recent Podesta wikileaks may offer some clues.

‘Neil McC’ is almost certainly USAF General William Neil McCasland.

Rob F. Weiss, according to bloomberg: 
>has been Executive Vice President and General Manager of Aeronautics Advanced Development Programs at Lockheed Martin Corporation since July 29, 2013. Mr. Weiss served as an Executive Vice President of Global Sustainment at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. since October 2008 until July 2010.
>He also served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Aeronautics Operations, which included responsibility for Technical Operations, Production Operations, Supply Chain Management, Information Systems & Technology and Quality. He served as Aeronautics Executive Vice President for Global Sustainment, where he was responsible for the $3 billion logistics, maintenance and aircraft modernization lines of business. He is a retired U.S. Naval Reserve Captain who served as an aircraft carrier-based S-3 Viking pilot prior to joining Lockheed Martin. Mr. Weiss is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and holds a master's degree in Systems Management from the University of Southern California.

Michael Carey, according to wikipedia:
>a retired American military officer who served in the United States Air Force.[1] On June 12, 2012, he assumed a dual command of the 20th Air Force (20 AF/CC) and Task Force (TF) 214, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, which has effectively put him in charge of the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force of 450 nuclear missiles.[2] In October 2013, he was reassigned as a special assistant to the commander of the U.S. Air Force Space Command Gen. William L. Shelton.[1] Carey retired from the Air Force on June 1, 2014, after 36 years of service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone who has been closely following the subject of disclosure knows that a number of ‘whistleblowers’ with extremely outlandish stories have, in recent years, claimed that certain powers intend to roll out a gradual ‘trickle down’ disclosure campaign. These recent wikileaks are evidence to support this claim, and the personnel informing DeLonge means we need to take him seriously as well.

The way I see it, one of two things is happening:

**1. There is indeed an attempt being made to slowly reveal the truth to the public.**

**2. This is the next phase of a long-game psychological operation to forward some sort of agenda that necessitates the subject of ETs and UFOs be taken seriously by the broader public.** 

**As we deliberate between these two conclusions, we must first ask: who benefits?**

If even a small amount of whistleblower testimony is to be believed, it means that those in control of these programs have done some absolutely despicable things. Were the public to know the truth, it stands to reason that a shitstorm of unprecedented magnitude would erupt. If this is all real, there will be an effort to spin the narrative, to portray scum in a more positive light and glaze over their crimes against humanity. Alternatively, they are trying to prolong disclosure so that all the truly guilty parties will have escaped or died of old age by the time the full truth is known. 

If this is all an elaborate psyop, the endgame seems less clear, but as we all know, when it comes to US intelligence meddling, they leave no stone unturned. Do not let your guard down, but keep an open mind.

He described a “cross hall” with a buddha-like idol sitting cross-legged with a flower in each hand, carved out of the chamber walls. Additionally, Kincaid reported “vases or urns of copper and gold, enamelled and glazed vessels, granaries filled with seed, burial chambers filled with sarcophagi, and countless other wonders.

According to the story, Kincaid left the location and arrived in Yuma, AZ. Shortly after, the story was published in the Arizona Gazette. There are rumors of the Smithsonian sending a team of 30 to explore and document the amazing find — but no evidence remains. Shortly after, news stories regarding the discovery evaporated into silence.

When queried later, Smithsonian officials denied institutional relationships with Kincaid or Prof. S.A. Jordan. The site and its surroundings in Marble Canyon were reportedly acquired by the U.S. Government and declared “off limits” to visitors. A metaphorical door slammed on the entire topic.

But stories have persisted, and many claim to know the location of the entrance, called “Kincaid’s Door.” Theories and speculation about a coverup abound; just do a google search on “Grand Canyon Egyptian Artifacts.

Dominating the landscape beyond the Rocky Mountains, the immense Colorado Plateau stretches 130,000 square miles from the Wyoming border to the North, the Arizona/Nevada border to the East, and beyond the [Four Corners](https://www.gaia.com/article/paranormal-hotspots-and-mysteries-of-the-colorado-new-mexico-borderlands) region along the Colorado/New Mexico border further East.

A thorough exploration of the region would take months — even years. The Grand Canyon alone could take weeks to explore, beyond requisite tourist attractions. The Havasupai people have lived in the canyon for at least 800-years, and have successfully fought for restoration of tribal lands taken by the federal government. A travertine dome near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers is believed to be the “*sipapu*,” or “place of emergence” by native people. This sacred formation is nameless, simply referred to as sipapu by indigenous people. Tribal leaders prefer to keep the location private.”

“Few locations on the planet can rival this amazing ‘great wound in the Earth,’ as it was described to Francisco Vasquez de Coronado by the Hopi in 1540,” said [Christopher O’Brien](https://www.ourstrangeplanet.com/may-2012-expedition-to-sipapu-the-place-of-emergence-part-two/), a journalist and investigator who has explored the canyon and its legends for years. 

The first documented white man to “lay sight” on the confluence area in Marble Canyon was [Seth Tanner](http://thephoenixenigma.com/the-grand-canyon-mystery/), a Mormon pioneer married to a Hopi woman. While he had good relations with the Navajo and Hopi tribes in the region, when the Hopi learned he had seen the sacred site, they blinded him. His life was spared because of his Hopi wife, but he was told that if he spoke of what he saw, his tongue would be cut out.",conspiracy,Wyoming

List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming
This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.

Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97-98%[1]) are convinced by the evidence that humans are significantly contributing to global warming.[1][2]
This is a list of scientists who have made statements that conflict with the scientific consensus on global warming as summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and endorsed by other scientific bodies. Very few are climate scientists. Nearly all publishing climate scientists (97-98%[1]) support the consensus on anthropogenic climate change,[3][4] hence this list represents a minority viewpoint.
The scientific consensus is that the global average surface temperature has risen over the last century. Scientific opinion on climate change was summarized in the 2001 Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main conclusions on global warming at that time were as follows:
	1	The global average surface temperature has risen 0.6 ± 0.2 °C since the late 19th century, and 0.17 °C per decade in the years 1971-2001.[5]
	2	""There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities"", in particular emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.[6]
	3	If greenhouse gas emissions continue the warming will also continue, with temperatures projected to increase by 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C between 1990 and 2100.[A] Accompanying this temperature increase will be increases in some types of extreme weather and a projected sea level rise.[7] The balance of impacts of global warming become significantly negative at larger values of warming.[8]
These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized nations;[9] the consensus has strengthened over time[10] and is now virtually unanimous.[11] The level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science.[12]
There have been several efforts to compile lists of dissenting scientists, including a 2008 US senate minority report,[13] the Oregon Petition,[14] and a 2007 list by the Heartland Institute,[15] all three of which have been criticized on a number of grounds.[16][17][18]
For the purpose of this list, a ""scientist"" is defined as an individual who has published at least one peer-reviewed research article in the broad field of natural sciences, although not necessarily in a field relevant to climatology. Since the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, each has made a clear statement in his or her own words (as opposed to the name being found on a petition, etc.) disagreeing with one or more of the report's three main conclusions, and each has been described in reliable sources as a climate skeptic, denier, or in disagreement with any of the three main conclusions. Their views on climate change are usually described in more detail in their biographical articles. Few of the statements in the references for this list are part of the peer-reviewed scientific literature; most are from other sources such as interviews, opinion pieces, online essays and presentations.
NB: Only individuals who have their own Wikipedia article may be included in the list.


Scientists questioning the accuracy of IPCC climate projections
These scientists have said that it is not possible to project global climate accurately enough to justify the ranges projected for temperature and sea-level rise over the next century. They may not conclude specifically that the current IPCC projections are either too high or too low, but that the projections are likely to be inaccurate due to inadequacies of current global climate modeling.

Additional details from this article:

**Undisclosed Donations**

Before Mrs. Clinton could assume her post as secretary of state, the White House demanded that she sign a memorandum of understanding placing limits on the activities of her husband’s foundation. To avoid the perception of conflicts of interest, beyond the ban on foreign government donations, the foundation was required to publicly disclose all contributors.

To judge from those disclosures — which list the contributions in ranges rather than precise amounts — the only Uranium One official to give to the Clinton Foundation was Mr. Telfer, the chairman, and the amount was relatively small: no more than $250,000, and that was in 2007, before talk of a Rosatom deal began percolating.

But a review of tax records in Canada, where Mr. Telfer has a family charity called the Fernwood Foundation, shows that **he donated millions of dollars more, during and after the critical time when the foreign investment committee was reviewing his deal with the Russians. With the Russians offering a special dividend, shareholders like Mr. Telfer stood to profit.**

His donations through the Fernwood Foundation included **$1 million reported in 2009, the year his company appealed to the American Embassy to help it keep its mines in Kazakhstan; $250,000 in 2010, the year the Russians sought majority control; as well as $600,000 in 2011 and $500,000 in 2012.** Mr. Telfer said that his donations had nothing to do with his business dealings, and that he had never discussed Uranium One with Mr. or Mrs. Clinton. He said he had given the money because he wanted to support Mr. Giustra’s charitable endeavors with Mr. Clinton. “Frank and I have been friends and business partners for almost 20 years,” he said.
**
The Clinton campaign left it to the foundation to reply to questions about the Fernwood donations; the foundation did not provide a response.**

Mr. Telfer’s **undisclosed donations came in addition to between $1.3 million and $5.6 million in contributions**, which were reported, from a constellation of people with ties to Uranium One or UrAsia, the company that originally acquired Uranium One’s most valuable asset: the Kazakh mines. Without those assets, the Russians would have had no interest in the deal: “It wasn’t the goal to buy the Wyoming mines. The goal was to acquire the Kazakh assets, which are very good,” Mr. Novikov, the Rosatom spokesman, said in an interview.
**
Amid this influx of Uranium One-connected money, Mr. Clinton was invited to speak in Moscow in June 2010, the same month Rosatom struck its deal for a majority stake in Uranium One.

The $500,000 fee — among Mr. Clinton’s highest — was paid by Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin that has invited world leaders, including Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, to speak at its investor conferences.
**
Renaissance Capital analysts talked up Uranium One’s stock, assigning it a “buy” rating and saying in a July 2010 research report that it was “the best play” in the uranium markets. In addition, Renaissance Capital turned up that same year as a major donor, along with Mr. Giustra and several companies linked to Uranium One or UrAsia, to a small medical charity in Colorado run by a friend of Mr. Giustra’s. In a newsletter to supporters, the friend credited Mr. Giustra with helping get donations from “businesses around the world.”

Renaissance Capital would not comment on the genesis of Mr. Clinton’s speech to an audience that included leading Russian officials, or on whether it was connected to the Rosatom deal. According to a Russian government news service, **Mr. Putin personally thanked Mr. Clinton for speaking.**

A person with knowledge of the Clinton Foundation’s fund-raising operation, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about it, said that for many people, the hope is that money will in fact buy influence: ***“Why do you think they are doing it — because they love them?”*** But whether it actually does is another question. And in this case, there were broader geopolitical pressures that likely came into play as the United States considered whether to approve the Rosatom-Uranium One deal.

66,The Government has been keeping secrets on alien contact. This is the story of a redditor that has deleted his account.

Commenting here was a mistake and I wish I hadn’t done it. It changed everything for me, not all in bad ways but mostly in bad ways. I’m commenting again now because there are people on Reddit and probably elsewhere who are claiming to be aliens or that I am a government agent or an alien agent or something like that and they are all lying. I’m talking about the history of the earth guy and the end of an era contract guy. These are hoaxes. They don’t know anything and it looks to me like they are trying to take advantage of my story and my life to get attention. I haven’t even visited reddit for years and now I’ve seen all these posts about my comments. I wish I had never commented at all all but July is so close and I won’t be here much longer so what’s the point of not talking anyway and I think I owe it to a few people who have meant a lot to me. It makes me angry to see people try to take advantage like this when people have really suffered and really want answers. So I’m try to type it all out. Maybe I’ll run out of energy or stop caring but I’m going to try. I was wrong about a lot when I posted before and I’m sorry but I didn’t mean to mislead anyone its just that I didn’t know what I know now.

After I commented on here my relationship with Jack and Gina changed especially with Gina and it was like it opened a door up for me and I was able to ask more questions and learn from her. And I guess that’s good because I was able to learn a lot more about who they are and what they are doing. But in the whole this was a big mistake because it made my life here so much worse than it already was. I messed up big time and I’m still paying for it every day and I’m maybe going to pay big for it in a couple of days.

I’ve been up sixtenn times since I commented on here and it’s much more often now because they are almost done with me. I am going up once more this week and that’s it. I’ll stay with them in the big ship for a while and then I’ll go back with them. That’s what they’ve told me and I know that I don’t have a choice about this and I don’t care anyway. I don’t think they are going to hurt me but honestly I don’t know anymore. I’ve found out a lot about them and it’s not good mostly. They might kill me. I know that, but I also don’t think that they’ll torture me in any way or imprison me or anything like that. It doesn’t seem like them to do anything like that so even if they are lying it’s a better deal then I’ve got here.

When I answered questions on here before I was afraid of human people here on Earth, not afraid of aliens, and I think I made that pretty clear. I didn’t know at the time that they ever did anything that hurt people. I don’t think they do it a lot and I really still don’t fear that they are going to hurt me. It was because I was afraid of people that I made a throwaway account on here instead of using my real name. I didn’t want anyone to find me, obviously, and because I wanted to protect the privacy of one of my friends, who is’t my friend it turns out. I wasn’t afraid of the government at the time but I should have been. I don’t know if the government was monitoring or if that’s how they found me but I was abducted by the United States Government in broad daylight in 2015. They never identified themselves but they were pretty clearly Fbi or CIA or something like that and I was in the United States when it happened, so I know it was the U.S. government and not some other government. Whoever they are, but I think I know, they know who I am and where I am. They kept me for three days and tortured me far worse than the aliens ever have. They abducted me again in 2018 at an airport on my way back into the country and they tortured me for 7 days.

I don’t think the government found me because of my comments here. They weren’t monitoring me and probably didn’t even know I existed. Jack and Gina did know what I was doing and that’s why I had to quit answering questions last time I was here. I don’t know how they knew it was happening right when it was happening, but they knew and they told me to stop. They had to either be monitoring the whole internet or monitoring me and so I’m pretty sure it was just me. They are probably monitoring me right now, too. Also while I’m thinking about it I think I should mention that Jack and Gina tried to tell me what they call themselves. They don’t call themselves aliens obviusly. I can’t spell the word that Gina used and I can’t even remember what it sounded like exactly but they said that it meant Friends of Friends. I think that was probably a pretty rough translation

They were really, really angry with me and they took me up a couple of days after I stopped commenting here. It’s hard to explain but they didn’t exactly threaten me but they did tell me that things were going to be different after that and that I shouldn’t talk about them anymore and that things were changing. Again they didn’t hurt me but I was pretty scared of them for the first time in a long time. I was scared enough of them after that that the first chance or excuse I had I left America for a while but they found me wherever I went. They know where I am all the time I think and that makes me think that I probably have some kind of tracking device in me somewhere. I don’t know that for sure but they’ve found me and taken me up now in six different cities on two different continents so they must have some way of knowing where I am. Well, I guess technically three different continents.

After posting here I started talking with Gina though and it was different. This is so stupid to say but I think Gina felt sorry for me or maybe I don’t know maybe she or he or it actually sort of liked me. But after I got in trouble with them it was different and instead of just showing me things and asking me questions they started letting me ask questions. Gina would even say, “Do you have questions for me?” I don’t know why but I never bothered to ask Gina if she was a boy or a girl of if they had boys and girls. It didn’t seem important at the time but now it seems like it’s important because I don’t know whether to type she or her or it or what. That makes it difficult for me to type this and keep on topic so I’m just going to say “she” for Gina because that’s the name she gave me and I think of her that way. Asking questions and having conversations with them is always very difficult for me and it leaves me exhausted. They just don’t understand English well and they say stuff in weird ways very literal ways that don’t make sense. It takes a long time to understand one another.

I wouldn’t say I was friendly with Jack and Gina ever but it was definitely different. It seemed like they wanted me to ask questions and like they wanted to answer. And I really believed that Gina and I were sort of becoming friends which I know sounds very stupid. But that ended and changed in 2016 when Jack and Gina left to go back to their home and they took Diane with them. I don’t know why they went back but it wasn’t like all of the Friends of Friends went back. Jack never came back. And Gina came back in 2018 but she was so different when she came back to the point that I wondered if it was the same Gina or if this was like a different Gina and so I even think of her now as Gina 2. They all look sort of the same but with little differences that you can tell, and Gina 2 has the same scar that Gina did, although now I don’t know if that is a scar or if it’s just something about the way her skin is. Now Gina 2 is very down to business with me and she doesn’t seem like she cares at all about me and I don’t know if she ever did anyway.

They took Diane away in 2016 and I haven’t seen or heard much about her since then but Gina 2 says that I’m going back with them the same as Diane did. So I hope that I’ll see her again because I got pretty close to her family several years ago. I haven’t talked with her mom in a while now and she and her step-father had a falling out but I don’t know what that was about. I don’t have any of my own family left really and I won’t ever have my own kids and Diane means a lot to me.

I was wrong about some of the stuff I told you all when I commented last time and I think I should clear up a couple of things.

First, I’m really sorry that I said that they don’t hurt people because sometimes they do. I asked Jack and Gina about what they do to people, not just why they are studying me but what they do to other people too. Jack and Gina told me there are three kinds of human subjects that they study. The first is like me who they study over a long period of time and who they talk with and study for a long time. I don’t know how I got put in this group or why they would be interested in talking with me more than anyone else. I think it’s just luck because they don’t treat me like there’s anything special about me. I’ve asked them and they didn’t really understand the question I don’t think. Some people in this group have been taken up hundreds of times over 80 years or more but Gina told me that usually people don’t get taken up anymore after they hit their forties. At the time I thought that meant that maybe they lost interest in people when they got older but now I think that maybe it’s that most people in this group don’t live that long. Some of us in this group they take back with them to wherever it is they come from.

The second group of their little experiments are people who probably don’t even realize they are being observed at all, never abducted, but watched and studied. I don’t think I’m in this group and so I don’t know nearly as much about it. I guess maybe they are watching me, but I feel like the people in this group they probably watch like all the time and I know they don’t watch me all the time. I don’t think they do anyway.

The last group is people who they use for physical testing and that usually kills them. Gina said that they don’t hurt people just to hurt people, that they aren’t mean, but that these people can’t survive the testing. I’m not sure what it is they do to them but it kills them. I am really, really sorry that I gave the impression that they didn’t do this when they actually do. I didn’t know about it at the time and I swear that I wouldn’t have come on here and commented that they don’t hurt people at all when they do. I still don’t think people have anything to worry about because they don’t eat people, they aren’t trying to harvest our organs, they aren’t trying to steal our water or anything like that. But they do some bad things sometimes and there’s nothing I can do about it and I’m sorry that I made people think that they don’t when they do.

One other thing I was wrong about was that I think I probably said that Jack and Gina’s race that I’m just going to call Friends of Friends because that’s what they call themselves, didn’t make a lot of those movies that they showed me. The Friends of Friends have only been here for something like 3000 years. Before that it there were others here to watch us and I think something bad happened and they were completely killed off by the Friends of Friends and they got earth along with everything else that those others had. I don’t know much about those others and this is not a thing I could really ask about so I really filled in some of my understanding here. Whoever the aliens were before, they must have been doing pretty much the same thing as the Friends of Friends because they bothered to take all the videos and everything. But the way Jack and Gina talked about I got the feeling that they didn’t care for those others, like the others might have been their enemies or they might have done something bad. When they talked about it, they didn’t talk about it like it was just a shift change or something. I’m pretty sure there was a war and the Friends of Friends killed all the others. And I’m not sure about this either but I think that the big ship might actually have been built or brought here by those others and not by the Friends of Friends. I know that when Jack and Gina went back home for a while, they didn’t go in the big ship. The big ship pretty much stays put I think and I’ve still never seen it from the outside so I don’t know what it looks like. It might not even be a ship, I guess. It could be like an office building on the moon for all I know.

The other big thing that I was wrong about was that I said that they don’t have religion. They say they don’t but I don’t know about that. I know this sounds like they are stupid, and they can’t be stupid if they can travel all the way here and have these ships and all this technology, but this sounds pretty stupid to me.

Gina said that there are a lot of different beings out there. I can’t remember if she said thousands or millions, but I think she said millions. And there are millions of planets with life on it, she said, and then there are some forms of life that don’t even have planets. Some planets have just like fungus on them or some fish or plants. But there are I think she said millions of civilizations out there. Many of them are as advanced as hers she said. She said that there are only 7 planets in the whole world that are like the earth where the dominant life form has the simple problems. She called them the simple problems, not me. She didn’t tell me a list of the simple problems, but she told me some of them that were prayer and faith healing and churches and sorcery and magic and all that kind of stuff, mostly all stuff about religion. And of those 7, she said there were only 3 where people experienced deja vu, or believe in prophecies, or that worship idols. We are one of those three and that’s why the Friends of Friends are here. That’s why the others were here, too, and that’s why the next group is coming in July. Gina says that they know that the whole world isn’t really what it looks like but it’s actually the creation of a single intelligence and that we and everything exist inside that intelligence. I asked her if it was like the Matrix and then I explained to her what that was and she said it wasn’t like that at all and so then I asked her if was like when that hospital show ended and it turned out to all be a kid imagining it in a snow globe and she said it wasn’t like that either. But she said that it’s the one thing that everyone in the world agrees on, all these thousands and thousands of advanced civilizations, they apparently all have proof that the world is imaginary or a dream or a computer program or something. And they study earth and the two other planets like it because they are pretty sure that these three planets and the intelligent life on them are either mistakes, like accidents, or else one of them might be the center of the whole thing and everything else is a mistake or an accident. They want to figure out which is which so that they can better understand the intelligence that creates the world.

That sounds a lot like religion to me. I tried to finish up college a few years ago and I took a world religions course and to me this sounds like religion, but I’m not an expert so I don’t know. Also I didn’t end up finishing college. I only have like three courses left but I’m not never going to get there and that bothers me a lot because a lot of people in my family were really educated and were doctors and engineers and I’m just nothing special. That’s mostly because of this thing that I’ve had to deal with as part of my life.

When I look back on all the videos they’ve shown me and all the questions they’ve asked it’s pretty clear that this is what they are studying in me. I should have seen that even before Gina told me but it’s hard to think clearly about things like this because it’s traumatic. I’ve read some of the comments you all have made about me in the last few months and I’ve seen a few of you mention mental health stuff, like maybe I’m crazy. I’m not crazy. I’m not delusional or insane. But over the years I’ve had to deal with this shit in my life and it’s not easy and maybe that’s caused me to see things a little differently than they really are. I don’t mean like I’m imagining things but that I’m maybe justifying things or rationalizing them. You have to understand that I don’t have my own life, if you can understand that. I’m not in control of it. Someone else is. And they’ve done stuff to me, like taking me away and forcing me to watch things and interrogate me and all of it, and I don’t have a choice. I don’t have a choice in it. And I think maybe when I was commenting here before maybe I was putting kind of rose colored glasses on my experience because the reality of it is that my life doesn’t mean anything to anyone and I am powerless and it was easier for me to think of Jack and Gina as friendly and as the things they do with me as just not so bad. I don’t know what my point is here except that you shouldn’t trust most abuction stories. I wouldn’t trust most of the alien stuff that you hear, either, because people out there want attention and they are bored or they want to take advantage of you and make you do things and they make stuff up to get your attention. If you’ve been through it in reality it’s easy to spot the people making up stuff about it. I say this because I saw on one of your comments there’s a guy posting that he’s an alien named Adam and is going to show every one the true history of the planet through the internet starting this summer and he made his account right after I posted my comments and then started posting recently. At one point he even said that I was part of his scam somehow. That person is full of BS. That’s not a real thing and if you believe it then I’ve got a bridge to sell you. And I mention it also because you are probably going to hear a lot more accounts of abductions in the next few years because I’ve seen many more of us up there than I used to. Things have changed about the way they are observing us and there’s a lot more human contact and a lot of those people are bound to mention it to friends or family and then once that gets started the hoaxers and frauds are bound to start popping up. This stuff is really important though and not just for you and for earth but for the people who they are taking. We are people and this is not easy for most of us. It’s hard and it’s lonely and we don’t have anywhere we can get help.

My friend Sam that I mentioned before died in 2016 and I got a chance to meet his mother at the funeral and I think that helped her deal with the loss a little. He was a nice guy. He was the nicest guy I ever knew honestly. He was only 8 years older than me but he died of bone cancer and I wonder if it had to do with, I guess radiation or something, or just something about our experiences up there. I don’t know. Or I don’t know we are all getting older and maybe it was just his destiny to die like that, but I don’t think so and I don’t believe in destiny anyway. He was such a nice guy to me and his mother was heartbroken and there were almost no one at his funeral. And of course that’s not his real name, as I said last time I changed everyone’s name because I’m not about to out anyone on here and I happened to be thinking about that show Cheers at the time and that’s why I picked these stupid names.

I begged Coach to come with me to the funeral because it was the right thing to do and because I’d never traveled that far on my own but he wouldn’t and we haven’t spoken for years. He pretends like none of this is real and that it never happens. I know that they are still taking him up and I’ve tried to reach out to him but he stopped returning my calls. He is really famous now not just sort of famous but very very famous and I know that he’s afraid of what this could do to his career, but it’s not like I would ever name him so I don’t know why he cut me out of his life. This thing that we are all going through is different for each of us and some of us handle it differently, I guess. But to me it felt different than that when he wouldn’t go to Sam’s funeral it was like I had insulted his mother or something, like how dare I ask him to go to the funeral of some trashy nobody. When really he just had a couple of lucky breaks and that’s the only difference between him and Sam. Or even between him and I. I’m not bitter about his success but I am so furious with him about the way he changed and treated me when Sam died and didn’t even acknowledge Sam or go to his funeral. I know that he will never ever admit to any of this but I also know that Coach was in the same group as me and that eventually they were going to take him back with them. I bet he thinks he’s safe from that now because he’s so seen everywhere and they wouldn’t dare take up a celebrity because then everyone would know but they don’t care about that. So live it up now, buddy, because sooner or later you’re going to vanish and your truth will come out.

I met three other people who went up regularly over the last 8 or 10 years and made friends with them and I didn’t mention any of them last time I commented here because one I had just met and wasn’t sure if we were really going to be friends and the other two I hadn’t met yet. They are all dead now. Two of them committed suicide and the other one died in a car accident that I’m pretty sure was also a suicide.

So maybe you get it now when I say that once you’ve been through this you can tell when people are lying. They don’t set you back down here with a message of world peace or a warning to stop wars. They don’t care about us, not like that they don’t. They don’t select some old man on a hillbilly vacation to give him a message about how to save the whales or to fight satan. And the fact of it is is that it takes a hell of a lot of patience fronm me to get to the point where I could ask them questions about anything.

This thing has been a part of my terrible life since I was a kid and it’s too much to deal with to be honest. I haven’t ever been able to hold down a real job and I haven’t been able to make real friends or have relationships that meant anything except I was very close to Diane and her family but she’s gone now too. Dad died in 2010 and left me our house and a little bit of money. My mom died a long time ago but that’s a whole another story. If it weren’t for the house and the money he left me I would have ended up on the street and then you all here would never have heard of me and anyone I talked to would have thought I was a crazy homeless man. And that’s how most of us probably end up is either living in the street or else driving our cars off of cliffs and taking enough pills to not wake up. I don’t know why I’ve been able to handle it and other’s can’t. I don’t know why Coach can handle it and others cant. I don’t know what makes us any different or what makes us similar. And maybe we can’t handle it better anyway and maybe the better way is just to go out on your own terms or to lose your mind and get locked up. I don’t know really but I know that when you scroll through comments on here no one seems interested in what day to day life is like for someone like us whose lives are taken over by this.

I don’t know anything is the fact of it all at the end of the day. The only thing I know for sure is that when someone says they have answers, or that the aliens told them things, or that they are an alien, or anything for sure about aliens or conspiracies or anything like that, you can be pretty sure that that person is full of BS and is trying to pull one over on you. That’s the truth and maybe the only full truth that I know. Because if this happens to you, if this really happens to you, then you don’t get answers. You don’t get to understand. And you don’t come forward and pretend to have the answers. When this happens to you you spend all your days feeling like garbage and you try to hide.

I’ve had I don’t know how many jobs over the years all at around minimum wage, making sandwiches, delivering pizza, filling shipping boxes, janitorial work, but I can’t hold a job because of this. I couldn’t finish college because of this and I barely finished high school if you want to know that fact of it. I hardly leave my house or go out in public, not because I think people will think I’m crazy and not even because I’m afraid of people but because I’m so tired all the time. I know that I have trauma and I know that maybe the way I see these things is shaped by that and all of that. I know that but it doesn’t change the fact this is the day to day reality. I miss my dad and I miss Diane and I even miss Coach and I hardly get through a day without thinking about Sam because I just have no one else in my life. All the time I’m lonely and it hurts to be this alone.

So no I don’t know how their machines work or how they travel here or where I’ll be going with them or any of that. I don’t know any of that and that makes me feel even worse because I have no just no control and no understanding about it. And even if I asked them or if they could tell me how could I know? And how could I explain it to anyone if anyone would listen anyway? I don’t even know how cell phones work. How does an air conditioner work? How do they get air into the machine that puts air in your car tires? I don’t know any of this stuff. How long have they been here? I don’t know but I don’t even know how long we have been here. Do they have any weaknesses? I don’t know and if they did do you think they would tell me? Can they feel love? I don’t know that for sure because how could I know that. Why did they choose July 18? I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t have any answers to these things and I’m sick of having the questions. And I don’t care that I’m not coming back because I don’t have anything here. I’m so tired of the loneliness and the sadness of this place. So what. I’m not afraid of them or of the government either because there’s nothing they can do. Every moment of my life is the worst moment of my life.

I’ll tell you what is frustrating is to see so many comments on here and not just on here but everywhere about conspiracy this and conspiracy that and you can see in their faces or in their words that they want to be a part of it and they want this experience. But you DO NOT want this experience. It’s frustrating to see people who think they have figured something out because they stayed up late on a Wednesday night reading something on the web and now they think they understand or they’ve figured something out. You’re out of your mind if you think you can figure it all out. I’m not the crazy one. And you won’t get your answers from the government coverup report that’s about to come out that will say Oh sure there’s some unexplained stuff but we don’t know about any aliens.

And I hate to break it to everyone, but they already made contact. They are here and they have been here and they are now in contact with humans. I’ve seen many, many, many more of us up there on my last several trips and they weren’t like me not like Coach or Sam these aren’t abductees or whatever it is that we are. When you see an abductee up there we usually look either like they are leading us down the hallway in a dentists office or else we are throwing our arms around and screaming because we are so scared. But the people up there now are different. But now there are people up there who look like business men and military men. They are sitting up there on their own without being guarded, and they are having meetings, and they are watching something on screens and talking back like probably with people back on Earth. They are wearing like army uniforms and military jackets. I’ve heard these people up there speaking in English and in languages that I don’t understand but, I mean, I know that some of them were Chinese, and some were Japanese or Korean, and there were some that were French because I do recognize French. I’ve seen people who look Arab and African and everything you can imagine. They are in contact with us. I know that the U.S. government is in contact with them because I’ve seen American military up there and also because when the U.S. government men kidnapped me they asked me questions that they couldn’t have just made up. They had information about the ships and about what they have done to me on those ships and about me, and the only way they could have gotten all that information was if they were also talking with the friends of friends or whatever you want to call them. And that was years ago, so I know that the government at least knew about them years ago. And you wonder what you’ll learn from the report?

Whatever was planned for July is still going to happen so far as I know, but it has definitely changed. Something changed and I’m pretty sure that’s why this report is coming out, but I can’t be sure about that. I’ve heard Friends talking about a report for years and years but I didn’t know it would happen this way. I don’t know if the report that’s coming out is to prepare us or if it’s just a cover up. I don’t know what it all will be on the 18th, either, except that Gina 2 and the Friends of Friends are leaving and someone else is coming and that whatever will happen on Earth is not colonization. I’ve seen maps up there and it looks like on the 18th something will happen at least in western Africa, something in maybe China or around China, and in Wyoming or Colorado or Utah. It’s hard for me to know where stuff is just looking at maps without the state and country borders on them but none of the maps up there have any of those lines so I’m making educated guesses on those three spots.

I don’t know for sure what the government report will be but I think that the point of it is misdirection. There’s a big change in the program coming and the Friends are leaving, and that’s one of the reasons why I’m going too, I think. And something about that change I think might be really noticeable or destructive or something. There won’t be answers in any report, just misdirections, that’s my bet.

This took me a lot longer than I thought it would and it’s too late to answer questions, but I don’t know if I would want to. I can’t tell you exactly what will happen on the 18th and I don’t care anyway. Whatever it is I just don’t care even if it is destructive or even if the people coming to replace the Friends of Friends are terrible and they colonize. I don’t have the ability to care anymore because I’m just tired and I’ve had to accept my destiny. The only way I make it through my nights right now is telling myself that in a few weeks time I’ll get to see Diane and make sure that she’s ok. I’m probably being stupid because they are probably going to do something bad to me, but it really can’t be worse than this and I have no choice but to believe that this will work out for me. I can’t make it through the night without believe that. And believe me I know how pathetic it sounds when I say that all I have to look forward to is seeing a girl who is practically like a niece or a distant cousin and who might not even remember me for all I know. She’s been gone a long time and I know there are others of us that they have taken so I hope that she’s met some friends and is happy wherever she is and I guess wherever it is that I am going and maybe there will be enough of us there that I can make some friends.",conspiracy,Wyoming
67,Increased satellite traffic?,18.0,g3i6mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g3i6mm/increased_satellite_traffic/,25.0,1587187301.0,"Over the past 2 nights i have seen an insane amount of satellites in the night sky. Has anyone else noticed this? 

I didn't know where else to ask this - internet searches return nothing....

- I have spent hundreds of nights in dark skies and can recall witnessing a handful of satellites per night. I'm now seeing 50+ in the early hours of the night (9 to 11pm pacific) 

- Definitely not planes. I have confirmed with the neighbor and wife that they appear to be satellites. They are fast, unblinking, silent and dont leave contrails (as the infrequent overhead planes are currently leaving)

- I am in a semi-rural area, but by no means do we have 'dark skies' (at least not the kind I'm used to in Utah, Wyoming and eastern-Oregon). We are w/in 50mi of a major metro area in the PNW 

- they are frequently (though not entirely) observed in perfectly simillar paths at perfectly similar intervals

Some thoughts; 

- are the lock downs improving air quality/light pollution that I'm just now seeing things I haven't before? This seems unlikely given my previous  true dark sky experience...

- even the highest estimates of man-made satellites are in the neighborhood of 20,000 - given my perspective, that STILL makes the odds of me consistently observing 5 or 6 at a time, mathematically improbable.

Thoughts? Questions? Wtf?

72,"Top 13 ‘Coincidental’ Connections Between Communitarianism and COVID, racism protests, Climate Change and 2020.",14.0,irxuh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/irxuh9/top_13_coincidental_connections_between/,12.0,1600002049.0,"1. **Community policing replacing state police**

Clearly the Defund The Police aspects of the BLM narrative play directly into the currently-vague communitarian LE alternative solutions they propose.

In the UK we will soon have COVID marshalls (Marshall law?) to police COVID measures specifically:

[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/boris-johnson-covid-marshals-plan-criticised-shambolic-england](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/boris-johnson-covid-marshals-plan-criticised-shambolic-england)

2) **Precrime elements and identification of ‘problems’:**

“Every American city and town that has Community Policing follows the same principles for the new job of the police. Where it all originated is always sort of missing from the whole sales pitch presented on their websites.

""COP embraces two key policing strategies:

1. Response to Incidents (R2I) \[and\]
2. **Problem Oriented Policing (POP).**

COP balances the use of these two strategies through careful continuous analysis of activity patterns that permit differentiated police response to community needs."" New Jersey COP

**(John Deaton explains: ""#2 is Non-incidental; i.e., Problem Oriented Policing = Precrime Over (real) Problems = Pretty Obvious Profiling."" ) Problem Oriented Policing (POP) is a communitarian concept formulated in the 1980s.”**

[http://nord.twu.net/acl/ebookdownload/2020\_ebook.pdf](http://nord.twu.net/acl/ebookdownload/2020_ebook.pdf)

**3)  A database of everything:**

”**A communitarian system requires a database of everything.** It needs to have a log of every piece of land: every drop of water, every animal, every insect, every plant, the air above it, the minerals below it, and every individual living on planet Earth.”

The **Asset Based Community Development (ABCD)** was created to achieve this objective by Professors John McKnight and Jody Kretzman.

Kretzman denies being a communitarian, but his co-author and co- designer McKnight (Barack Obama's mentor and the signature on his Harvard Law School application), signed the Responsive Communitarian Platform.”

**In Mapping and Mobilizing Community Capacity, McKnight and Kretzman spell out the need for building a sustainable community based on neighborhood assets. Assets are the possessions, properties, skills and abilities of human beings.**

ABCD also screens for local training potential. Leadership is rewarded with a higher ranking volunteer position, a no-bid government contract, or a big fat grant.”

**Community Mapping, Planning and Analysis for Safety Strategies (COMPASS)** is another of the many international COPS’ data gathering software programs. (P.107)

Communitarian data is all linked into a global Geographical Information System (GIS). It can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

The GIS began primarily as a database of grid maps and satellite imagery used to map utilities, public roads and public services. GIS maps show the terrain, the streets, where the power lines and sewage pipes tie in, garbage routes, traffic lights, buildings and emergency facilities like hospitals and fire stations.

**The GIS stores essential knowledge used to run a modern city. In the right hands, GIS technology is a benign tool. Much like a handgun, it can be safely and responsibly put to good use. But the communitarians have a more sinister design for the potential layers of data stored together in one giant, global GIS**. (P.107)

In 1992, the UN suggested the GIS as a tool to implement Local Agenda 21plans. The potential for the GIS is endless.

""The Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) pilot project leverages proven technology to assist criminal investigations by implementing factual data analysis from existing data sources and integrating disparate data from many types of Web-enabled storage systems. This technology helps to identify, develop, and analyze terrorist activity and other crimes for investigative leads. Information accessible includes criminal history records, driver's license data, vehicle registration records, and incarceration/ corrections records, including digitized photographs, with significant amounts of public data records. This capability will save countless investigative hours and drastically improve the opportunity to successfully resolve investigations. The ultimate goal is to expand this capability to all states."" (U.S. Senator Michael B. Enzi from Wyoming, in a letter to Wyoming citizen James Dobson on 1/10/05. Senator Enzi, like George Soros, is a close associate of Dr. Amitai Etzioni)

**4) Emphasis on conditional human rights rather than unalienable individual rights**

The idea that common people must be governed by elites is always the same, but morphs every hundred years or so; **the latest version of elitism is called human rights. One primary difference between individual rights and human rights is that under individual rights the burden of proof always rests on the state, whereas the more moral communitarian idea of human rights puts the burden of proving innocence on the accused.“** (p.34)

&#x200B;

**5) Emphasis on responsibilities rather than rights**

“**We hold that our call for increased social responsibilities... is not a call for curbing rights. On the contrary, strong rights presume strong responsibilities**."" Amitai Etzioni, Informal Education Homepage

“This year they will gather at Rio Janeiro, Brazil for the 20th Anniversary of the Earth Summit, to celebrate 20 years of implementing United Nations Local Agenda 21 Programme for Sustainable Development around the globe. Issues that cross all borders, like global food security, climate change, degradation of the environment, economic crises and political unrest set the stage for world leaders to lay out their global management solutions. After years of careful preparations and agreements between elite powers, **it is agreed that every individual on the planet must be subordinated to the global community. The common good will forever replace the outdated and destructive notion of individual rights.”**

**6) Emphasis on the collective rather than the individual**

“As a scholar who dedicated the last 15 years to communitarian public philosophy, I have frequently argued that individual rights have been unduly expanded, often at the cost of the common good... In addition, I devoted a whole book to the limits of privacy, and I am among those who hold that Sept. 11, 2001, changed what constitutes a ""reasonable"" search.” Amitai Etzioni Communitarian Newsletter #4, received on the [COMMLAW@hermes.gwu.edu](mailto:COMMLAW@hermes.gwu.edu) elist, October 17, 2005. Also in The National Law Journal Online on September 19, 2005.

**Limits to personal freedoms under the pretext of “the common good”:**

Revised Noise Ordinances establish new limits for lively or loud behavior. Permits are required for even small gatherings. Large parties require background checks of all the hosts and hiring of licensed security guards. Airline travel is subject to monitoring. Hunting, fishing and guns laws change so fast, who knows what they are?” (P.79)

**7) Public Private Partnerships AKA corporatism AKA fascism:**

“Certain words that define communitarian programs can be found in all the new programs. Partnerships between the government and the corporate business sector (formerly known as Fascism) and coordination are key ingredients to Rebuilding Community.

""We are a unified Department with a shared focus: strengthening our Nation – through a **partnership with individual citizens, the private sector, state, local, and tribal governments, and our global partners**. We must also coordinate across Federal agencies, while shaping homeland security policy and coordinating incident management."" DHS 2008 Strategic Plan

[https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Domestic-Security/Documents/DHSStrategicPlan2008-2013.aspx](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Domestic-Security/Documents/DHSStrategicPlan2008-2013.aspx)

“The truth of their hidden agenda is now known and we know their real intentions. These people are front-men for the New World Order communitarians. **Communitarian policy has been seen as fascist corporatism with the primary difference that instead of focussing on nation states, own country and people, it propagates a supranational policy**. A secondary difference is it influences by means of informal social structures, like for example Common Purpose, instead of by institutionalised State violence - at least for the time being.” (p.278)

Private security firms, privatisation of the NHS etc are all becoming publicly accepted under the pretext of COVID. As the global economy crashes further, we will see increasing ‘assistance’ from private corporate entities.

**8) Neighbourhood snitching and informants encouraged**

The desire of local authorities to interact more with ’good citizens’ within communities to root out ‘problems’:

The Wars on Poverty, Drugs, Terror, Smoking, Obesity, and Crime follow Hegelian protocol for waging wars on people who show signs of State censored behaviors. What kinds of behaviors ""give rise to public safety issues""? **Whatever bothers the ""good"" people. Sold to us as just, friendly, ""neighbor"" cops, the new police play by international rules”.**

“We’ll all help rebuild a global-to-local communitarian community. Hidden assets are uncovered during communitarian information interviews. **During HUD-COPS’ crime prevention programs they are called Knock-and-Talks. In the 1980s, cops went door-to-door interviewing neighbors and identifying potential “problems.”**

**9) Erosion and outright demolition of private property rights.**

“Corona Power Grab: Local Govts Given Power to Demolish ‘Contaminated’ Buildings“:

[https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/06/uk-local-councils-given-power-to-destroy-contaminated-buildings/](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/06/uk-local-councils-given-power-to-destroy-contaminated-buildings/)

“Conservation easements pick away at the borders of private property along streams and new public trails. **Habitat and species restoration calls for confiscation of all private land designated as necessary to seeing the vision completed**. Building permits must be pre-approved by professional global-to- local developers to ensure they fit in with the vision.”  (p.79)

**The removal of property rights is happening in myriad ways. Using the pretext of sustainability, we have even seen tribes thrown off ancestral lands:**

[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism)

**Non-human species are given precedence under communitarian law; they are given much larger portions of space. Human activity in Wildlife corridors is regulated. Human beings have been identified as a threat to the planet and are reduced to being either a problem or an asset.**

**10) Chipping and tracking individuals:**

“Insiders know that Communitarianism is the foundation for Corporatism and Monopoly Capitalism too. **Hurricane Katrina helped push the idea for chipping Americans onto the COMPASS database**. The new chips can be uploaded and altered via satellite.

""The ultimate solution may be that provided by a service called **VeriMed**. As do the other providers, VeriMed stores your PHR online — but then also provides **a tiny chip that is Implanted, usually under the skin of your upper arm, containing a unique 16 digit number.""** “Create your own digital medical record - How to make sure your vital information isn't lost“ by Michael Rogers, Columnist, Special to MSNBC (2005)

(P.102)

11) **Volunteerism, “in it together’:**

In the UK we’ve been asked in the last six months of lockdown to volunteer for the health service, on farms etc. Nothing wrong per se, admirable in theory, but it undeniably serves as communitarian training. Some on state benefits have been compelled or persuaded to work in order to maintain their benefits. Some are additionally asked to volunteer for vaccine studies.

”Communitarians know what it means to give something back. They understand the need for re-training Americans. They value pure volunteerism. **They believe it is in the best interests of the “community at large” to be able to identify every individual in the area.** People should help. We’re all part of the new Homeland Security plan to make America safer. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security uses ABCD maps too. It’s vital to “security.”

\[ 2020: Our Common Destiny – page 99 of 326 – The Anti Communitarian Manifesto \]

**12) Transnational corporations continue unfettered and increase prosperity, while local business is closed down under the weight of regulation(s)**

A report entitled ""The Quiet Revolution,"" prepared for the Council of Environmental Quality in 1971, contains a powerful statement of problems caused by delegation of land use control to towns, villages, boroughs, cities, and townships:

""This country is in the midst of a revolution in the way we regulate the use of our land. . . . **The ancient regime being overthrown is the feudal system under which the entire pattern of land development has been controlled by thousands of individual local governments**, each seeking to maximize its tax base and minimize its social problems, and caring less what happens to all the other.""

[www.jstor.org/stable/2562684](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2562684)

Meanwhile:

“Communitarian agreements sound fair and just, but all they **accomplish is to protect global corporations from competition.** In global disputes, communitarian law will always favor corporate interests over the small-fry local property or business owners.”

**“A big problem is the fact that U.S. law was established by free men to safeguard themselves.**

**Sustainable partnerships between corporations and governments gets rid of the main barrier to the vision.** The US government was created to protect the property and rights of individuals. US law assures individuals retain self control. Citizens oversee all US government affairs. Board directors of private companies are not subservient to citizens. The US government is accountable to everybody.... that's what the law says anyway.

Global-to-Local business partners are not even accountable to their own stockholders. Private-public partnerships blur the lines so that only the “stakeholders” know what the stakes are in the real game.“

13) **Global poverty, health and education crises in the developing world, exacerbated purely by COVID measures used as a pretext for a fairer, more equitable...blah blah blah...**

UN report finds COVID-19 is reversing decades of progress on poverty, healthcare and education:

[https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/sustainable/sustainable-development-goals-report-2020.html](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/sustainable/sustainable-development-goals-report-2020.html)

**""A new world order must provide for the full and fair participation of the majority of the people of the world who live in developing countries. They must have equitable opportunities to share the benefits, just as they share the risks, of our technological civilization. And surely the highest priority should be accorded to eradication of the dire and debilitating poverty that condemns so many people, particularly in developing countries, to suffering and hunger that are an affront to the moral basis of our civilization. This is one of the primary themes of Agenda 21**."" Remarks by **Maurice F. Strong** Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ontario Hydro Chairman, The Earth Council, The European Institute, Washington, D.C., USA, November 4, 1993

Taxpayers should begin paying their debt to the global society now...

""... the United States has introduced major new initiatives: the Global Health Initiative (GHI) and Feed the Future (FTF). Through the GHI, the United States will invest $63 billion to help countries build and strengthen their health systems and achieve significant improvements in health outcomes, with a particular focus on women, newborns, and children. **Through FTF, we will invest $3.5 billion over three years to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger through agricultural development and food security.""**

I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes. The moral effect should be good and it would spread a lively terror. ~ Winston Churchill commenting on the British use of poison gas against the Iraqis after World War I


A terrorist is someone who has a bomb but can’t afford an air force. ~ William Blum


Once you have seen certain things, you can't un-see them, and seeing nothing is as political an act as seeing something. ~ Arundhati Roy


Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. ~ Nazi Hermann Göring

The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. ~ George Orwell
 
 
Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear, kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor, with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it. ~ General Douglas MacArthur


I spent thirty-three years in the marines, most of my time being a high-class muscle man for big business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism. ~ General Smedley Butler, Marine


Every war when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defense against a homicidal maniac.~ George Orwell

I'm ineffably tired of pro-war ideologues moaning about how the anti-war folk are just 'complaining' without 'offering solutions' to global dilemmas. Peace doesn't need a freekin moral, ethical, economical, or political qualification; war does. Peace doesn't ravage, plunder, rape, or kill; war does. Peace does not need justification, war does. ~ <|OnAir|>


When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, o any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi


When a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty. ~ George Bernard Shaw

Those who hate and fight must stop themselves; otherwise it is not stopped. ~ Spock, Day of the Dove


I dream that someday the United States will be on the side of the peasants in some civil war. I dream that we will be the ones who will help the poor overthrow the rich, who will talk about land reform and education and health facilities for everyone, and that when the Red Cross or Amnesty International comes to count the bodies and take the testimony of women raped, that our side won't be the heavies. ~ Richard Cohen


Over breakfast coffee we read of 40,000 American dead in Vietnam. Instead of vomiting, we reach for the toast. Our morning rush through  crowded streets is not to cry murder but to hit that trough before somebody else gobbles our share. ~ Dalton Trumbo


Vietnamese deaths during the Vietnam war were up to 4,000,000 people. The approximate population of Vietnam was 35 million in 1960. This means that the war killed 11 percent of the total population of Vietnam. The population of the United States is 308,000,000. Proportionately, 11 percent of this is 34,000,000. That would be like killing every man, woman and child in:

Iowa,
Mississippi,
Arkansas,
Kansas,
Utah,
Nevada,
New Mexico,
West Virginia,
Nebraska,
Idaho,
Maine,
New Hampshire,

Then they killed 20 per cent of the population of North Korea.


They made a wasteland and called it peace. ~ Tacitus

Everyone laughs and cries in the same language. ~ dreamslaughter


You get what anyone gets; you get a lifetime. ~ Death, Neil Gaiman Comic Sandman

Zionist Communitarian control of the anti-Agenda 21 movement

by  Niki Raapana        APRIL 17, 2013      “In 2000, we identified Communitarianism as the legal system supporting Agenda 21. We identified the ""guru"" of the [Communitarian Network](http://communitariannetwork.org/), whose own writings tell us he was a [terrorist](http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1102/etzioni.html), a [soldier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitai_Etzioni) and now a [planner](http://blog.amitaietzioni.org/2013/04/israel-65-years-ago.html) in the Zionist takeover of British Palestine.  I quickly understood why some Christians would never consider these facts, but I've been trying to understand why so many of the Americans actively opposing Agenda 21 and claiming to be on our ""side"" avoided discussing Communitarianism and its root philosophy, Zionism, for 13 years.

2020: Our Common Destiny & The Anti Communitarian Manifesto (ISBN-13: 978-0-9814519-2-3) explores the history, philosophy, and modern-day implementation of Sustainable Development, Communitarian Law, and Community Policing.

Part-autobiography, part-thesis, and part-guidebook to International Law, this 327-page book introduces Community Law with a mix of personal experiences, field research, and direct quotes from American presidents and international heads of state, domestic and foreign courts, officials, ecclesiastics, gurus, agencies, think tanks, universities and law schools, foundations, conferences, scientific reports, newspapers, and academic journals. 

The Roosevelt Neighborhood Plan (Washington) and The Anchorage 2020/Anchorage Bowl Comprehensive Plan (Alaska) are highlighted to show how Local Agenda 21 plans balance individuals, laws, and economic growth. Readers are challenged to consider some of the little-known aspects of Community Economic Development, like mapping and mobilizing human assets, data-mining, innovative militarized policing, mandates for service, global citizenship, the Hegelian Dialectic, and the ancient spiritual foundation for a worldwide, corporate, quasi-religious legal framework.

Niki Raapana and Nordica Friedrich began publishing in 2000, after they were used as uninformed Human Subjects Research in Seattle, Washington. Their original analysis of Communitarianism reaches an international audience; their work has been referenced and reproduced in books, websites, articles, curriculums and academic papers, including the National Association of Scholars Bibliography of the Communitarian Residence Life Movement.”

Top 13 ‘Coincidental’ Connections Between Communitarianism and COVID, racism protests, Climate Change and 2020.

&#x200B;

1. **Community policing replacing state police**

Clearly the Defund The Police aspects of the BLM narrative play directly into the currently-vague communitarian LE alternative solutions they propose.

In the UK we will soon have COVID marshalls (Marshall law?) to police COVID measures specifically:

[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/boris-johnson-covid-marshals-plan-criticised-shambolic-england](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/boris-johnson-covid-marshals-plan-criticised-shambolic-england)

2) **Precrime elements and identification of ‘problems’:**

“Every American city and town that has Community Policing follows the same principles for the new job of the police. Where it all originated is always sort of missing from the whole sales pitch presented on their websites.

""COP embraces two key policing strategies:

1. Response to Incidents (R2I) \[and\]
2. **Problem Oriented Policing (POP).**

COP balances the use of these two strategies through careful continuous analysis of activity patterns that permit differentiated police response to community needs."" New Jersey COP

**(John Deaton explains: ""#2 is Non-incidental; i.e., Problem Oriented Policing = Precrime Over (real) Problems = Pretty Obvious Profiling."" ) Problem Oriented Policing (POP) is a communitarian concept formulated in the 1980s.”**

[http://nord.twu.net/acl/ebookdownload/2020\_ebook.pdf](http://nord.twu.net/acl/ebookdownload/2020_ebook.pdf)

**3) A database of everything:**

”**A communitarian system requires a database of everything.** It needs to have a log of every piece of land: every drop of water, every animal, every insect, every plant, the air above it, the minerals below it, and every individual living on planet Earth.”

The **Asset Based Community Development (ABCD)** was created to achieve this objective by Professors John McKnight and Jody Kretzman.

Kretzman denies being a communitarian, but his co-author and co- designer McKnight (Barack Obama's mentor and the signature on his Harvard Law School application), signed the Responsive Communitarian Platform.”

**In Mapping and Mobilizing Community Capacity, McKnight and Kretzman spell out the need for building a sustainable community based on neighborhood assets. Assets are the possessions, properties, skills and abilities of human beings.**

ABCD also screens for local training potential. Leadership is rewarded with a higher ranking volunteer position, a no-bid government contract, or a big fat grant.”

**Community Mapping, Planning and Analysis for Safety Strategies (COMPASS)** is another of the many international COPS’ data gathering software programs. (P.107)

Communitarian data is all linked into a global Geographical Information System (GIS). It can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

The GIS began primarily as a database of grid maps and satellite imagery used to map utilities, public roads and public services. GIS maps show the terrain, the streets, where the power lines and sewage pipes tie in, garbage routes, traffic lights, buildings and emergency facilities like hospitals and fire stations.

**The GIS stores essential knowledge used to run a modern city. In the right hands, GIS technology is a benign tool. Much like a handgun, it can be safely and responsibly put to good use. But the communitarians have a more sinister design for the potential layers of data stored together in one giant, global GIS**. (P.107)

In 1992, the UN suggested the GIS as a tool to implement Local Agenda 21plans. The potential for the GIS is endless.

""The Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) pilot project leverages proven technology to assist criminal investigations by implementing factual data analysis from existing data sources and integrating disparate data from many types of Web-enabled storage systems. This technology helps to identify, develop, and analyze terrorist activity and other crimes for investigative leads. Information accessible includes criminal history records, driver's license data, vehicle registration records, and incarceration/ corrections records, including digitized photographs, with significant amounts of public data records. This capability will save countless investigative hours and drastically improve the opportunity to successfully resolve investigations. The ultimate goal is to expand this capability to all states."" (U.S. Senator Michael B. Enzi from Wyoming, in a letter to Wyoming citizen James Dobson on 1/10/05. Senator Enzi, like George Soros, is a close associate of Dr. Amitai Etzioni)

**4) Emphasis on conditional human rights rather than unalienable individual rights**

The idea that common people must be governed by elites is always the same, but morphs every hundred years or so; **the latest version of elitism is called human rights. One primary difference between individual rights and human rights is that under individual rights the burden of proof always rests on the state, whereas the more moral communitarian idea of human rights puts the burden of proving innocence on the accused.“** (p.34)

**5) Emphasis on responsibilities rather than rights**

“**We hold that our call for increased social responsibilities... is not a call for curbing rights. On the contrary, strong rights presume strong responsibilities**."" Amitai Etzioni, Informal Education Homepage

“This year they will gather at Rio Janeiro, Brazil for the 20th Anniversary of the Earth Summit, to celebrate 20 years of implementing United Nations Local Agenda 21 Programme for Sustainable Development around the globe. Issues that cross all borders, like global food security, climate change, degradation of the environment, economic crises and political unrest set the stage for world leaders to lay out their global management solutions. After years of careful preparations and agreements between elite powers, **it is agreed that every individual on the planet must be subordinated to the global community. The common good will forever replace the outdated and destructive notion of individual rights.”**

**6) Emphasis on the collective rather than the individual**

“As a scholar who dedicated the last 15 years to communitarian public philosophy, I have frequently argued that individual rights have been unduly expanded, often at the cost of the common good... In addition, I devoted a whole book to the limits of privacy, and I am among those who hold that Sept. 11, 2001, changed what constitutes a ""reasonable"" search.” Amitai Etzioni Communitarian Newsletter #4, received on the [COMMLAW@hermes.gwu.edu](mailto:COMMLAW@hermes.gwu.edu) elist, October 17, 2005. Also in The National Law Journal Online on September 19, 2005.

**Limits to personal freedoms under the pretext of “the common good”:**

Revised Noise Ordinances establish new limits for lively or loud behavior. Permits are required for even small gatherings. Large parties require background checks of all the hosts and hiring of licensed security guards. Airline travel is subject to monitoring. Hunting, fishing and guns laws change so fast, who knows what they are?” (P.79)

**7) Public Private Partnerships AKA corporatism AKA fascism:**  


Perhaps the most topical representation of the fusion of corporate interests and the State is via the pharmaceutical companies in general and the vaccines specifically. Corporatism is, after all, Mussolini’s word to describe his particular brand of fascism.

“Certain words that define communitarian programs can be found in all the new programs. Partnerships between the government and the corporate business sector (formerly known as Fascism) and coordination are key ingredients to Rebuilding Community.

""We are a unified Department with a shared focus: strengthening our Nation – through a **partnership with individual citizens, the private sector, state, local, and tribal governments, and our global partners**. We must also coordinate across Federal agencies, while shaping homeland security policy and coordinating incident management."" DHS 2008 Strategic Plan

[https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Domestic-Security/Documents/DHSStrategicPlan2008-2013.aspx](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Domestic-Security/Documents/DHSStrategicPlan2008-2013.aspx)

“The truth of their hidden agenda is now known and we know their real intentions. These people are front-men for the New World Order communitarians. **Communitarian policy has been seen as fascist corporatism with the primary difference that instead of focussing on nation states, own country and people, it propagates a supranational policy**. A secondary difference is it influences by means of informal social structures, like for example Common Purpose, instead of by institutionalised State violence - at least for the time being.” (p.278)

Private security firms, privatisation of the NHS etc are all becoming publicly accepted under the pretext of COVID. As the global economy crashes further, we will see increasing ‘assistance’ from private corporate entities.

**8) Neighbourhood snitching and informants encouraged**

The desire of local authorities to interact more with ’good citizens’ within communities to root out ‘problems’:

The Wars on Poverty, Drugs, Terror, Smoking, Obesity, and Crime follow Hegelian protocol for waging wars on people who show signs of State censored behaviors. What kinds of behaviors ""give rise to public safety issues""? **Whatever bothers the ""good"" people. Sold to us as just, friendly, ""neighbor"" cops, the new police play by international rules”.**

“We’ll all help rebuild a global-to-local communitarian community. Hidden assets are uncovered during communitarian information interviews. **During HUD-COPS’ crime prevention programs they are called Knock-and-Talks. In the 1980s, cops went door-to-door interviewing neighbors and identifying potential “problems.”**

**9) Erosion and outright demolition of private property rights.**

Achieved via global economic collapse, debt forgiveness, UBI and the concept of renting what we need. Uber and the like have quietly prepared us for this state for affairs.

“Corona Power Grab: Local Govts Given Power to Demolish ‘Contaminated’ Buildings“:

[https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/06/uk-local-councils-given-power-to-destroy-contaminated-buildings/](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/06/uk-local-councils-given-power-to-destroy-contaminated-buildings/)

“Conservation easements pick away at the borders of private property along streams and new public trails. **Habitat and species restoration calls for confiscation of all private land designated as necessary to seeing the vision completed**. Building permits must be pre-approved by professional global-to- local developers to ensure they fit in with the vision.” (p.79)

**The removal of property rights is happening in myriad ways. Using the pretext of sustainability, we have even seen tribes thrown off ancestral lands:**

[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism)

**Non-human species are given precedence under communitarian law; they are given much larger portions of space. Human activity in Wildlife corridors is regulated. Human beings have been identified as a threat to the planet and are reduced to being either a problem or an asset.**

**10) Chipping and tracking individuals:**

“Insiders know that Communitarianism is the foundation for Corporatism and Monopoly Capitalism too. **Hurricane Katrina helped push the idea for chipping Americans onto the COMPASS database**. The new chips can be uploaded and altered via satellite.

""The ultimate solution may be that provided by a service called **VeriMed**. As do the other providers, VeriMed stores your PHR online — but then also provides **a tiny chip that is Implanted, usually under the skin of your upper arm, containing a unique 16 digit number.""** “Create your own digital medical record - How to make sure your vital information isn't lost“ by Michael Rogers, Columnist, Special to MSNBC (2005)

(P.102)

11) **Volunteerism, “in it together’:**

In the UK we’ve been asked in the last six months of lockdown to volunteer for the health service, on farms etc. Nothing wrong per se, admirable in theory, but it undeniably serves as communitarian training. Some on state benefits have been compelled or persuaded to work in order to maintain their benefits. Some are additionally asked to volunteer for vaccine studies.

”Communitarians know what it means to give something back. They understand the need for re-training Americans. They value pure volunteerism. **They believe it is in the best interests of the “community at large” to be able to identify every individual in the area.** People should help. We’re all part of the new Homeland Security plan to make America safer. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security uses ABCD maps too. It’s vital to “security.”

\[ 2020: Our Common Destiny – page 99 of 326 – The Anti Communitarian Manifesto \]

**12) Transnational corporations continue unfettered and increase prosperity, while local business is closed down under the weight of regulation(s)**

A report entitled ""The Quiet Revolution,"" prepared for the Council of Environmental Quality in 1971, contains a powerful statement of problems caused by delegation of land use control to towns, villages, boroughs, cities, and townships:

""This country is in the midst of a revolution in the way we regulate the use of our land. . . . **The ancient regime being overthrown is the feudal system under which the entire pattern of land development has been controlled by thousands of individual local governments**, each seeking to maximize its tax base and minimize its social problems, and caring less what happens to all the other.""

[www.jstor.org/stable/2562684](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2562684)

Meanwhile:

“Communitarian agreements sound fair and just, but all they **accomplish is to protect global corporations from competition.** In global disputes, communitarian law will always favor corporate interests over the small-fry local property or business owners.”

**“A big problem is the fact that U.S. law was established by free men to safeguard themselves.**

**Sustainable partnerships between corporations and governments gets rid of the main barrier to the vision.** The US government was created to protect the property and rights of individuals. US law assures individuals retain self control. Citizens oversee all US government affairs. Board directors of private companies are not subservient to citizens. The US government is accountable to everybody.... that's what the law says anyway.

Global-to-Local business partners are not even accountable to their own stockholders. Private-public partnerships blur the lines so that only the “stakeholders” know what the stakes are in the real game.“

13) **Global poverty, health and education crises in the developing world, exacerbated purely by COVID measures used as a pretext for a fairer, more equitable...blah blah blah...**

UN report finds COVID-19 is reversing decades of progress on poverty, healthcare and education:

[https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/sustainable/sustainable-development-goals-report-2020.html](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/sustainable/sustainable-development-goals-report-2020.html)

**""A new world order must provide for the full and fair participation of the majority of the people of the world who live in developing countries. They must have equitable opportunities to share the benefits, just as they share the risks, of our technological civilization. And surely the highest priority should be accorded to eradication of the dire and debilitating poverty that condemns so many people, particularly in developing countries, to suffering and hunger that are an affront to the moral basis of our civilization. This is one of the primary themes of Agenda 21**."" Remarks by **Maurice F. Strong** Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ontario Hydro Chairman, The Earth Council, The European Institute, Washington, D.C., USA, November 4, 1993

Taxpayers should begin paying their debt to the global society now...

""... the United States has introduced major new initiatives: the Global Health Initiative (GHI) and Feed the Future (FTF). Through the GHI, the United States will invest $63 billion to help countries build and strengthen their health systems and achieve significant improvements in health outcomes, with a particular focus on women, newborns, and children. **Through FTF, we will invest $3.5 billion over three years to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger through agricultural development and food security.""**

>Widespread reach  
Officially,  the Stasi employed around 90,000 people. But in order to  achieve such  levels of effectiveness, the Stasi relied on mass  participation. It’s  estimated that 1 in every 6 Germans were involved  informed for the  Stasi, and every factory, office and apartment block  had at least one  person living or working there who was on the Stasi  payroll.  
After  the collapse of the DDR, the true extent of Stasi surveillance  was  revealed: they had been keeping files on 1 in 3 Germans, and had  over  500,000 unofficial informants. The materials kept on citizens were   wide-ranging: audio files, photographs, film reels and millions of paper   records. Tiny cameras, hidden in cigarette cases or bookshelves were   used to spy in peoples’ homes; letters would be steamed open and read;   conversations recorded; overnight visitors noted down.

I  have been suffering from this for over a decade and with the COVID  narrative and my refusal to keep quiet it has gotten much worse.

84,Otto Warmbier was innocent,10.0,7m1ik4,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m1ik4/otto_warmbier_was_innocent/,13.0,1514211040.0,"I know this is an old topic but I recently got into an argument about this story and felt the need to vent. Would be interested to hear other people's opinions.

It is my belief that Otto Warmbier was likely completely innocent of stealing that propaganda poster. It's an important distinction to make because I see so many people  (especially here on reddit) saying that he deserved what he got because he went to a hostile and unpredictable country and broke the law so he deserved what he got (as outrageous as being outright murdered for stealing a poster sounds).

Firstly let's see what is alleged. North Korea allege a member of the Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming promised Warmbier a used car worth $10,000 in exchange for retrieving a slogan-bearing sign from the communist state. They allege Warmbier approached the sign in the middle of the night in an attempt to take it but that it was larger than he had anticipated, and he was forced to leave it on the floor. They also allege he did this with collaboration with the CIA and the secret  ""Z society"" in order to ""harm the work ethic and motivation of the Korean people"".

Now there are so many things wrong with this. Firstly, Warmbier was JEWISH. He was not even a member of the Methodist church. He was a 21 yr old student and obviously not involved with the CIA, not to mention it makes no sense for the CIA to care about a poster and its effects on worker morale. His family were very well off and there are more reasons why this allegation is obviously false but I won't go into that because most people agree this is absolute BS but believe he probably stole the poster anyway because he was a young, arrogant American looking for a thrill.

But let's look at what he actually stole. Most people assume he stole a poster of Kim Jung Un or one of the other leaders. But what he allegedly tried to steal was this:

http://www.radiomof.mk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/znakot-oto.jpg

Now lets take a moment here.Warmbier didn't UNDERSTAND Korean. This sign could have been giving direction to the toilet for all he knew. And what would he even do with it? Hang it on his wall? No one would even know what it meant. Let alone the sign being framed and is 2-3 fucking metres long! Is he going to smuggle it out in his bag?

Now you may say but isn't there footage of this theft? So lets look at the footage:

https://youtube.com/watch?v=SzVGIAcLsf8

You will see it is conveniently extremely dark and grainy. The person behaves bizarely by taking it off the wall and then putting it straight on the floor very carefully. Almost like a respectful North Korea actor might do maybe. I have also read on another forum that apparently in North Korea as there are power shortages this floor would typically not have lights on during this time which also suggests this was staged.

And finally and most tragically Warmbier was obviously mistreated and likely tortured. He acts bizarely during his confession suggesting he was under duress. When he was sent back to USA he was brain dead. North Korea state he suffered botulism and was given a sleeping tablet and had been like that since. American doctors state this is false and the scans of his brain are more consistent with respiratory arrest causing destruction of brain tissue. He tragically died soon after arriving back in the US.

North Korea behave very similarly to old and brutal Stalinist regime. They lie. They invent accusations and force false confessions out of innocent people to further their own agenda.

So why do people continue to victim blame Warmbier? I agree he probably shouldn't have gone to North Korea in the first place but the tour group he went with guaranteed it would be safe for US citizens and actually targeted young foreigners exactly like Warmbier so if anything, he was misled. I've also know someone personally who went to North Korea, it is not as uncommon as you might think.

To sum it up, here is my theory:

Warmbier was randomly targeted by North Korea because he was from the USA and they wanted leverage on the USA. They tortured him and forced a confession. When he was sentenced to 15 yrs hard Labour maybe he snapped and became agitated. He was heavily oversedated and went into respiratory arrest. Likely he was ignored or the severity of his sedation was not noticed until it was too late and he had suffered brain damage. When it became apparent he was dying North Korea panicked and shipped him back to the USA because they didn't want him dying whilst detained by them. They lied about all of it and most people still blame Warmbier because it is easier to blame him than to believe sometimes bad things happen to people who don't deserve it.

Yet the media and Reddit is only focused on NY for the most part. If the media cared about the health and well being of America the media should be focusing on what Wyoming has done CORRECTLY. Cuomo SHOULD NOT BE THE MOST POPULAR GOVERNOR right now. 

Is it simply because Wyoming is ran by Republicans and has a Republican Governor? Is it really that simple? Just take a look at this video from Clinton News Network. The way CNN describes Cuomos press conferences in such a positive way while describing how Andrew C. is not running for President yet still trying to convince and promote his campaign.

Yet all Governors are doing the same Press Conferences right now. Yet Wyomings Governor only has 18K Views on Youtube while Cuomo has upwards of over 451K + views. The political bias is real. The Censorship is real. The media’s death cult fascination with Cuomo is real. The media doesn’t care about Americas Health. They care about their political agenda which is the Democrats agenda. If they cared about America’s health they should be promoting what Wyoming did correctly instead of what NY FAILED MISERABLY ON.",conspiracy,Wyoming

90,Hoaxed?: The Forrest Fenn Treasure,9.0,j0bx5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j0bx5d/hoaxed_the_forrest_fenn_treasure/,7.0,1601147655.0,"Ten years ago a man named Forrest Fenn made an announcement to the world that he had hidden a small chest filled with valuable treasures, the value of gold and treasure was estimsted $1M+/-, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. More specifically hidden somewhere within the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado or New Mexico.

The details of the hunt you can research yourself, which up until recently had been going on for 10 years. What I'd prefer to focus on is the larger picture on what happened as the chase abruptly closed (during this summer of 2020) when Forrest Fenn (age 90) announced that the treasure had been found by ""some guy from back east"", never actually identifying the finder.

Not only did he *not* reveal the finder's name but also ""stiffed"" the thousands of people who took part in his treasure hunt by NOT revealing any of his poem/clue explanations *nor* the location of the hiding spot! This was a spot extremely special to him even as a young man, and marketed as such. A spot in the mountains that he wanted to die in where people would find his bones. Entire books were written and sold that loosely revolved around this spot (the chase) and his life. This magical spot's location his searchers were ultimately going to be rewarded with knowing. Or so they thought.

When it was announced that the treasure was found, he claimed to his fans he had *earlier* made the assertion that he will leave it up to the finder whether or not to reveal the location if/when they find it. To 99% of the searchers this was brand new information.

There is no doubt that if people were warned 10 years ago that the possibility exists that Fenn or the finder may not actually reveal the hiding location or the clue definitions after the treasure is found there would have been close to no interest in such a treasure hunt. I mean, who would spend hours and hours researching his clues traveling to and from the Rocky Mountains, risking their lives looking for hints to the treasure, reading his life stories in multiple books, etc, etc if there was even the *remote chance* there would be *no information* regarding the hiding location or clue meanings after it's been found? Hardly anybody.

Now, if you are new to this you'll undoubtedly see comments like, ""Well no shit sherlock, why would you trust some idiot and think it's real! blah blah"".

The thing is, this is a man who was a decorated fighter pilot, knew many famous famous people and told fireside stories about his life as a young boy hanging out in Yellowstone and as a pilot and family man. He was close friends with accomplished artists/authors like Eric Sloane (who is *amazing*) and was an art dealer to the wealthy of Santa Fe and beyond. He was also an excavator of artifacts throughout the west and cast maker of original sculptures that he ultimately sold in his art store making him a millionaire. Various pieces of gold, rare coins and other valuables were put in the treasure chest along with a tiny book about his story and the location.

It didn't take long for *most* perceptive individuals to determine that this guy was indeed legit. Most rational people established that he *really did* hide a chest of treasures in the Rocky Mountain wilderness for anybody to go get if they can decipher his poem. His motivation, he just wanted people to get off the couch and explore nature. His involvement with fans of the search was on par with a grampa with all his grandkids at his feet, telling stories and enjoying the adulation and fame that came with hiding a million dollar treasure in the mountains.


People died looking for it.


Now of course the small ""catch"" with the chase, if there was one, was you could solve the clues without the books he wrote/sold, but one book specifically ""the thrill of the chase"" he claimed had hints that could help you solve his riddle if you could find them scattered throughout the book. However he maintained you didn't *really* need the book. Others maintain that it *was* critical, and the book really did give extra hints. All speculation of course.


So, on it went. CBS television interviews, book store celebrations, websites/channels related to his hunt popped up in the hundreds. It was a fairly cult-like situation but with the notion that when all this brainstorming and clue deciphering is over and the chest is located the rest of the world would finally get to see the clue explanations and Fenn's heralded location.


None of this happened.


So to recap, you had a former military man, semi-famous millionaire art dealer, artifact rustler and gold digger claim to have hidden a treasure in the mountains where books can be bought to help you find it. What followed, ten years and millions of aggregate man hours of study and analysis, millions of miles of travel and hiking (""boots on the ground"") in and around the US Rockies in the search effort, only to be let down with a cold shoulder and story about this unidentified finder ""from back east"" not wanting to share his identity nor the location nor the poem's secret meanings.


Then, Fenn **dies** just a couple months later. What an incredible series of events in such a short window of time.


Fenn was no stranger to lawsuits either, and for obvious reasons. The crazy treasure hunt itself, being in a slightly nefarious line of business ""art dealing"" - some people called it grave robbing and/or stealing from sacred native Indian locations for his gallery. Fenn's supporters will argue on his behalf that ""all the crazies out there"" were threatening him or his family and that he had every right to go radio silent after it was ""found"" by some unnamed person ""from back east"", while also shoe-horning in a made-up ""rule"" at the last minute that he never said he'd give up the solution and would leave it up to the finder, etc. Others will say don't start a huge treasure hunt with media frenzy, selling thousands of books, then.


In the end, ""it is was it is"", as they say.


So what really happened? And was there a conspiracy? Let's discuss some possibilities, ranging from more-probable to less-probable, but still possible.


**Theory 1** - The treasure was never hidden and Forrest Fenn was a malignant narcissist scam artist that enjoyed the absurd amount of attention he received from such an idea/lie. The plan all along was to trick people into buying books and leverage this fame into his golden years as a sinister form of narcissistic supply with a final fuck-off to the world he secretly loathed under his fake maverick facade.


**Theory 2** - He really did hide a treasure, but then after lawsuits and negative attention he and some followers claimed he was receiving caused him to recoil on the whole idea of the treasure hunt. He was getting old and possibly senile and just wanted it over before his imminent death, so he went and grabbed the chest and made-up the stuff about the finder, deciding he didn't really want to reveal his famed location after all. ""To all the thankless assholes out there"", or whatever his reasoning.


**Theory 3** - Forrest was on his death bed, and under pressure from his family members (estate), his family concluded that the estate deserves the treasure, and why should they allow strangers to find what's ultimately theirs. So they coerced Forrest to reveal the location under pressure of real or made-up forces that are threatening the estate after his death and in a weak moment Fenn reveals the location to his family members (or one of them), they go get it and stage pictures with Fenn and the dirty ""found"" chest as verification, etc.


**Theory 4** - Fenn was military and some sources (military accounts) will cite Fenn as a ""member of intelligence"" in their story telling. Whatever that means exactly we don't know. It could mean something simple like he was local enemy intelligence or it could mean he was *literally* military intelligence. I always thought that with Fenn's rich lifestyle and checkered past, along with being military it was *possible* that he was actually CIA. And, this whole thing from day one was a weird military/psy-op of SOME degree. It could range from a simple domestic demoralization campaign during a larger scale, well planned-out military operation to an isolated test on an unsuspecting population of citizens involving AI and intelligence gathering well outside what we would even understand.


**Theory 5** - Some person from back east really did find the treasure and threatened Fenn with hardcore legal action if he or anybody else revealed his identity. And ultimately Fenn was forced to make up everything about allowing the finder to keep the details silent after the treasure was found as conditions of a given law suit, and Fenn was ultimately rooked.


**Theory 6** - They are ALL in on the scam, family and Forrest himself. Forrest is still alive, the death was faked to avert certain legal situations and they float off down the Firehole river into the sunset, laughin'.


.. or some combination of it all..


There are plenty of other theories I'm sure, and I would like to hear what others think. Cheers!",conspiracy,Wyoming

>I guess the person behind Saeki Co., Ltd. should feel appreciative he actually was graced with charges, rather than just had his purchased vehicles seized and spirited away with a mumbled explanation and some dodgy paperwork.

>Saeki Co. bought several luxury vehicles from a place called Texas Motors (which, oddly enough, is located in Florida) with the intent to sell them for a significant markup to wealthy Japanese citizens. This is possibly illegal, but not because of any explicit export ban. The only reason it verges on illegal is because resellers like Saeki ever-so-lightly tread on the toes of major manufacturers and their authorized dealers who do the same thing.

>The true legality of the situation is undetermined. The feds behind the first seizures of soon-to-be-exported vehicles didn't seem to have a firm grasp on the matter. They certainly *felt* it was illegal, and this feeling resulted in plenty of seizures, but [these agencies didn't have any crystal-clear guidance on the matter.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/business/dealbook/prosecutors-ease-crackdown-onbuyers-of-china-bound-luxury-cars.html?_r=0)

""The crackdown was driven largely by agents with the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security, who questioned whether these small export companies were violating federal law by using straw buyers — people paid small sums to buy cars — to conceal that the vehicles were being bought by people who had no intention of keeping them and were using cash from other people to make the acquisitions. 

""Federal authorities have argued that using straw buyers is a deceptive practice that potentially deprives American consumers of a chance to buy the luxury cars and limits the ability of automakers to keep tight control over sales to domestic dealers and to foreign countries.""

>It's not so much the American public losing a few opportunities to buy a luxury vehicle as it is the other thing: tight control of sales. The American public can't get many laws written in its favor, but large industries certainly can. 

>This initial thrust led to lots and lots of partnerships with local law enforcement agencies conveniently located near shipping docks. And this led to lots and lots of luxury vehicles ending up in the hands of law enforcement.

>Then, the government stopped the crackdown. It claimed to be making an effort to more tightly focus its forfeiture efforts as a result of Eric Holder's [reform initiative](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150116/13544229723/eric-holder-cuts-off-police-asset-seizure-shopping-sprees.shtml). 

>The appearance of being an errand boy for corporate interests certainly didn't help. Cases were dropped and charges dismissed. But the vehicles remained in the government's hands.

>One person in Saeki Co.'s position spent [two years fighting for the return of a seized vehicle and $125,000 in cash](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/u-s-ordered-to-return-assets-seized-in-crackdown-on-exported-cars/?_r=0). This followed about a dozen similar settlements, most occuring after a legal battle with the agency(ies) holding the vehicles. 

>In other cases, the prevailing parties still have yet to be fully recompensed. And others are still being prosecuted for violating a law the federal government isn't entirely clear on and has lost an interest in enforcing.

>[Saeki Co.'s story](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2190162/car-asset-forfeiture.pdf) is the worst of the potential situations. It had eight vehicles worth nearly $900,000 seized at the Long Beach Seaport by customs agents. This happened January 3, 2013. Two months later, customs agents seized another of its vehicles (worth over $100,000) in Seattle. 

>Two-and-a-half years later, the feds have abandoned everything about the case but Saeki's vehicles. And it simply doesn't want to talk about the seized property.

""Despite the Government’s change in policy, Plaintiff has not received administrative relief from CBP nor any communication from the Government justifying its seizure of Plaintiff’s vehicles."" 

>Other than the fact that it won't be bringing criminal charges.

""In or about early 2014, Assistant United States Attorney David Lazarus advised Plaintiff’s counsel that the federal grand jury investigation undertaken in the Middle District of Florida had concluded without any criminal charge lodged against Plaintiff or any of its agents.""

>So, no criminal activity but the government still wants to keep the cars -- which were seized under a vague ""felony interference of a business model"" law.

""Plaintiff’s vehicles were seized by CBP not because of any wrongdoing by Plaintiff, but because of an ill-conceived program by the Government to support a vehicle export monopoly at the expense of the Constitutional rights of Plaintiff and other vehicle exporters. ""

>As the complaint points out, the government's unwillingness to respond to the plaintiff is swiftly rendering the vehicles worthless. 

>Overseas purchasers willing to pay above US domestic retail for luxury vehicles are most likely going to want this year's model, not something that's been sitting around a government warehouse for almost three years. (And that's not taking into consideration the possibility the vehicles may have racked up miles as government agents' ""work vehicles"" or the occasional ""drive it like you seized it"" joyride.)

>Then there's the simple fact that a newly-purchased vehicle starts leaking resale value the instant a purchaser drives it off the lot.

""Using the generally accepted average vehicle depreciation rate of 20% in the first model year and 15% in subsequent years, the value of Plaintiff’s property has decreased in value by approximately $375,891.00 since their seizure. This measure increases every day that the Government fails to return the seized vehicles to Plaintiff."" 

>Much of the filing details ""conversations"" with the government about the return of the vehicles, most of which went something like this.

SAEKI CO.: So, there's no criminal charges? This means we can have our cars back, right?

GOV'T:

>The lawsuit repeatedly makes claims about Saeki Co. being deprived of due process. Which it has been. But civil asset forfeiture [isn't about due process](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150220/11454530092/wyoming-governor-vetoes-asset-forfeiture-bill-cites-questionable-seizures-support-his-decision.shtml). 

>These statutes provide -- from the very start -- a way for the government to bypass the protections due process affords to citizens. The cases themselves indicate that clearly. 

>It's not the government versus any named individual or company. It's the government against the seized property itself, which cannot advocate in its own defense and can only be spoken for if the government grants the request.

>So, while the company is absolutely right about being deprived of this right, in terms of asset forfeiture, this right simply [does not exist](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150620/20213931403/nail-salon-owner-sues-return-life-savings-seized-dea-agents-airport.shtml). 

>This lawsuit may force a response from the government, but it's a step it doesn't consider to be ""appropriate"" in terms of disputing seizures.

>What Saeki does have going for it is the government's ambivalence towards the ""law"" it claimed Saeki broke. If nothing else, a judge will be asking the government a few tough questions about how its ongoing non-prosecution has managed to tie up not-guilty vehicles for the better part of three years. 

>Given the racket that asset forfeiture is, that's about the best that can be hoped for.

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 180:""With the increasing size and importance of his oil holdings in Mexico and the United States, Doheny found his political influence growing in proportion to his economic power. Although he did not emerge as a figure of national importance until 1920, he had been a prominent Democrat on the West Coast since the late 1890s. From the beginning, Doheny's devotion to the party was rooted in his Irish-American heritage, faith in the Catholic church, and his long years on the Western frontier, which had made him a sympathetic follower of William Jennings Bryan.(Bryan was a member of the Sigma Pi literary society. He studied law at Union Law College in Chicago, He practiced law in Jacksonville from 1883 to 1887, then moved to the boom city of Lincoln, Nebraska. In Lincoln, he was raised a Master Mason in Lincoln Lodge 19, A.F. & A.M.[8], A $4,000 scholarship for Creighton University(Jesuit) students participating in Speech and Debate at the university is named after William Jennings Bryan.) Over time, however, his financial success eroded the logic, if not the sentiment, behind those positions, and, by the early 1920s, he found himself at a political crossroads. Had his ideas been totally mercenary, Doheny would probably have given up on the Democrats in 1916, when Republican presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes emphasized the Mexican crisis as a major campaign issue in opposition to Woodrow Wilson. Instead, Doheny's significant financial support in California helped Wilson achieve an improbable victory in his bid for reelection. ""

The Jesuits were very infiltrated into the United States Government at this time in history.

A good example of this is George Bruce Cortelyou, (July 26, 1862 – October 23, 1940) who was an American Cabinet secretary of the early twentieth century. He held various positions in the presidential administrations of Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.

Born in New York City, Cortelyou worked for the United States Postal Service, earning the attention of Postmaster General Wilson S. Bissell. On Bissell's recommendation, President Cleveland hired Cortelyou as his chief clerk. On Cleveland's recommendation, McKinley hired Cortelyou as his personal secretary. After McKinley's assassination, Roosevelt asked Cortelyou to lead an effort to reorganize the White House.At 20, Cortelyou received a BA degree from Westfield Normal School,He graduated from the law schools of George Washington University and Georgetown University(Jesuit). He was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at George Washington University.[1]

Impressed by Cortelyou's performance, Roosevelt appointed Cortelyou to the position of United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor in 1903. He left that position in 1904 to become the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and starting in 1905 he also served as the Postmaster General. He left both of those positions to become the United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1907. In that position, he worked to keep the economy stable during the Panic of 1907. After Roosevelt left office in 1909, Cortelyou became president of the Consolidated Gas Company.

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 126: ""Doheny's new 6,000-barrel-a-day refinery specialized in Mexpet (also a brand name for Mexican Petroleum's products) road oil and asphalt, which were marketed from a southern sales office in New Orleans(There just happens to be a Jesuit University in New Orleans!). Mexpet road oil was sold primarily to cities and railway companies that used it to control the dust along their lines. The asphalt needed no introduction, since it had been used for years on the East Coast with excellent results. Within a short time, the company was making deliveries as far north as Milwaukee, and in 1915, it added another station at Tampa, Florida, which included facilities for bunkering large ships and served as a distribution center for rail deliveries from Destrehan.48 To promote its operations along the eastern seaboard, Mexican Petroleum set up a main sales office in New York City and smaller outposts in Boston, Portland, Maine, and Providence, Rhode Island. Since oil was cheaper and cleaner to use than coal, this area became a prime location for securing industrial customers. In Portland, the largest purchaser was the International Paper Company. In Providence, the Jenckes Spinning Company kept Mexpet's three delivery trucks busy throughout the day. Mexpet also had smaller contracts with the American Woolen Company, the Manville woolen mills, D. Goff & Sons textile mill, and the Loutitt Home Hand Laundry Company. Apart from economy, the conversion from coal to oil provided unique benefits to each of these customers. Goff & Sons, for example, ran their boilers at full capacity only for half of the day but needed a minimum level of steam around the clock. Previously, the coal fires had to be banked at night, which consumed fuel during non-production hours. Converting to oil allowed the company to shut the burners off completely, except for one fifteen-minute interval, and still maintain the required amount of steam without any waste of fuel. Abandoning the use of coal at the laundry achieved a minor revolution by setting loose for other tasks a large group of workers who had been needed to pick the soot off the collars and clothes handled at the plant. To control these northeastern marketing and distribution centers, Doheny organized another subsidiary in 1915, the Mexican Petroleum Corporation of Maine. That company took over the existing outlets and added one more—at Carteret, New Jersey, located along the west side of Staten Island Sound. There, they constructed an oil storage depot and a large deep-water wharf capable of handling ships of any size. In addition, they employed a fleet of tugs and barges to supply Mexpet fuel oil to ocean liners at their respective piers anywhere in New York Harbor. By the end of the year, Doheny had fuel oil contracts with the International Mercantile Marine for its ships going from New York to California via the Panama Canal and with the Eastern Steamship Company for several of its lines, as well as a large contract to deliver crude oil to the Atlantic Refining Company in Philadelphia.49 Negotiations for transatlantic business began in the spring of 1914, when Doheny met with Lord Pirrie, Chairman of the Board of Harland & Wolff, one of Britain's largest shipbuilding and engineering firms. Pirrie headed an investment syndicate representing almost all of the major companies: Cunard, White Star, American, Red Star, Atlantic Transport, Dominion, National, and Leyland. And these organizations represented dozens of smaller steamship lines around the world. In April 1915, Doheny and Pirrie agreed to form the British-Mexican Petroleum Company to handle fuel oil sales in western Europe. This was an incredible opportunity, since the British investors involved were linked to a variety of manufacturing and railway enterprises in addition to their shipping interests. Although the first draft of the incorporation papers was ready by the summer of 1915, the agreement had to be put on hold when World War I diverted everyone's attention, and the company did not begin operations until 1919.50""

Notice how Ed Doheny met with Lord Pirrie, and they agreed to form the British-Mexican Petroleum Company to handle fuel oil sales in western Europe. This furthered the Vatican's monopolized control of the oil industry.

From Wikipedia we read ""The following year he(Lord Pirre) was appointed Controller of the Household to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in 1908 he was appointed Knight of St Patrick (KP).""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Patrick

further down we read ""Lord Pirrie was jeered in the streets after chairing a famous meeting of the Ulster Liberal Association addressed by Winston Churchill. That same year he was to travel aboard the Titanic, but illness prevented him from joining the ill-fated passage."" Hmmm maybe Lord Pirrie had prior knowledge that the Jesuits intended on sinking the titanic!

From Bill Hughes the Secret Terrorists chapter 5 we read : ""All the wealthy and powerful men the Jesuits wanted to get rid of were invited to take the cruise. Three of the richest and most important of these were Benjamin Guggenheim, Isador Strauss, the head of Macy’s Department Stores, and John Jacob Astor, probably the wealthiest man in the world. Their total wealth, at that time, using dollar values of their day was more than 500 million dollars. Today that amount of money would be worth nearly eleven billion dollars. These three men were coaxed and encouraged to board the floating palace. They had to be destroyed because the Jesuits knew they would use their wealth and influence to oppose a Federal Reserve Bank as well as the various wars that were being planned.

Edward Smith was the captain of the Titanic. He had been traveling the North Atlantic waters for twenty-six years and was the world’s most experienced master of the North Atlantic routs. He had worked for Jesuit, J.P. Morgan, for many years.

Edward Smith was a ‘Jesuit tempore co-adjator.’ This means that he was not a priest, but he was a Jesuit of the short robe. Jesuits are not necessarily priests. Those who are not priests serve the order through their profession. Anyone could be a Jesuit, and their identity would not be known. Edward Smith served the Jesuit Order in his profession as a sea captain.

Many interesting points about the Titanic are discussed in a videotape made by National Geographic in 1986. The videotape is entitled The Secrets of the Titanic. When the Titanic departed from Southern England on April 10, 1912, Francis Browne, the Jesuit master of Edward Smith, boarded the Titanic. This man was the most powerful Jesuit in all of Ireland and answered directly to the general of the Jesuit Order in Rome. The videotape declares:

A vacationing priest, Father Francis Browne, caught these poignant snapshots of his fellow passengers, most of them on a voyage to eternity. The next day Titanic made her last stop off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland. Here tenders brought out the last passengers; mostly Irish immigrants headed for new homes in America. And here, the lucky Father Browne disembarked.... Father Browne caught Captain Smith peering down from Titanic’s bridge, poised on the brink of destiny. — The Secrets of the Titanic, National Geographic, video tape, 1986.

Here is Jesuit treachery at its finest. The Provincial [Father Francis Browne] boards Titanic, photographs the victims, most assuredly briefs the Captain concerning his oath as a Jesuit, and the following morning bids him farewell. — Eric J. Phelps, Vatican Assassins, Halycon Unified Services, p. 427.

Browne went over with Edward Smith one last time exactly what he was supposed to do in the North Atlantic waters. The Jesuit General told Francis Browne what was to happen; Browne then tells Smith and the rest is history. Edward Smith believed that the Jesuit General

. . . is the god of the [Jesuit] society, and nothing but his electric touch can galvanize their dead corpses into life and action. Until he speaks, they are like serpents coiled up in their wintry graves, lifeless and inactive; but the moment he gives the word of command, each member springs instantaneously to his feet, leaving unfinished whatsoever may have engaged him, ready to assail whomsoever he may require to be assailed, and to strike wheresoever he shall direct a blow to be stricken. — R.W. Thompson, The Footprints of the Jesuits, Hunt and Eaton, pp. 72, 73.

Edward Smith was given an order to sink the Titanic and that is exactly what he did.

By the command of God, [the Jesuit General] it is lawful to murder the innocent, to rob, to commit all lewdness, because he [the Pope] is Lord of life, and death, and of all things; and thus to fulfill his mandate is our duty. — W. C. Brownlee, Secret Instructions of the Jesuits, American and Foreign Christian Union, p. 143.""

Surely Lord Pirrie knew the Jesuits intened to sink the titanic to get rid off Benjamin Guggenheim, Isador Strauss,Department Stores, and John Jacob Astor... these 3 men opposed the incoming federal reserve act that was passed in 1913.

Pirrie built the Temple of the Four Winds near the Devil's Punchbowl, Hindhead. The octagonal plinth still remains.[8]

From Wikipedia we read ""In the months leading up to the 1912 Titanic disaster, Lord Pirrie was questioned about the number of life boats aboard the ship. He responded that the great ship was unsinkable and the rafts were to save others. This move would haunt him forever.""

Ed Doheny was also very affiliated with the Catholic church, and was raised and kept his Irish Catholic faith his whole life.

This is shown in the book Material Dreams: Southern California Through the 1920s, By Kevin Starr page 127/128 : ""The Arch Bishop allowed the Doheny's the privilege of a private chapel in their various homes, with permission to have mass said there and consecrated Eucharist reserved on the alter for veneration. They became Knight and Lady of the Equestrian Order of the holy Sepulcher in 1925, and in 1939 his holiness Pope Pius XII raised Estelle Doheny, onetime telephone operator to the rank of papal countess. Through its legacy of European culture, its titles and tutelage the Roman Catholic Church, in this instance the Archdiocese of Los Angeles the most reverend John J Cantwell Archbishop, helped the ever genious Doheny's in the vital matter of taste and social self confidence. A psychological reserve of self esteem became very much necessary for both Doheny's in August 1924 when E.L Doheny was charged in the Federal District court of Los Angeles with bribing secretary of the interior Albert B Fall in November 1921(a loan of $100,000 in cash, carried to fall in a satchel by Edward Doheny) so as to obtain favorable leases on naval oil reserves at Elk Hills in Kern County. President Harding had previously transferred the administration of the two reserves at Elk Hills and Teapot Dome in Wyoming in May 1921, itself a dubious action. Fall in turn, had signed favorable leases with Doheny and oilman Harry F Sinclair. The teapot dome scandal dragged on for six long years of investigation and trail. In 1927, the government canceled the leases and in 1929 Fall was convicted of taking a bribe from Doheny, and went to jail. Doheny however got off on technicalities after two trials, thanks to Frank J Hogan of Washington DC, who once observed that the ideal client was a rich man who was scared""

The couple were married in 1904. Mr. Sinclair died Nov. 10, 1956.

The Jesuits bailed Dohney out from going to jail for bribing Albert Fall 100,000$, how is it possible that Fall was convicted of taking the bribe but, Doheny got off scotch free?.... Answer= The Jesuits!!

Frank J. Hogan (1877-1944) was a lawyer who co-founded the firm of Hogan & Hartson in 1904 and served as president of American Bar Association (ABA) from 1938 to 1939. He represented several high-profile clients, including former president Warren G. Harding, oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny, and banker Andrew Mellon. As ABA president he created the association's Committee on the Bill of Rights and supported the controversial Walter-Logan bill.

In 1938, Hogan denounced racial and religious intolerance in a half-hour speech aimed at fellow Catholics; the speech was aired on the same 34 radio stations used by the notoriously antisemitic priest, Charles Coughlin, immediately following Coughlin's regular broadcast.In 1898 Hogan joined the U.S. Army and put his clerical and railway experience to work in logistics, serving as secretary to the Chief Quartermaster of the Army, secretary to the Quartermaster General in Washington, and Secretary to the Chief of Staff of the Army. After work he spent his evenings studying law at Georgetown University(Jesuit). He completed the three-year program in two years, graduating at the head of his class in 1902.[1]fter graduation, Hogan went into private practice. At first he practiced law part-time in the evenings while working for the War Department during the day. He co-founded a Washington law firm, Hogan & Hartson, in 1904. From 1912 to 1919, he lectured at Georgetown University on the law of wills, evidence, and partnership.[1]

Hogan rose to national fame working on several high-profile cases in the 1920s and 30s. His most notable case was his defense of oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company in a series of trials from 1924 to 1930. In what came to be known as the Teapot Dome scandal, Doheny was accused of bribing Interior Secretary Albert Fall to lease the oil production rights at Elk Hills Oil Field. The company was forced to cancel its lease, but Hogan succeeded in clearing Doheny on charges of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the government. And just like Ed Doheny Frank Hogan received an award of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.[1]

It is proven here that Jesuit educated lawyer Frank Hogan bailed Doheny out on going to jail for corruption!

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 85 : ""In looking back over the period from 1900 to 1910, which formed the introductory phase of the Mexican petroleum industry, it is clear that Doheny was primarily responsible for the direction the industry would take. As a result of his past experience in California and his financial backing, Doheny succeeded where others feared to try. In reviewing his work with Canfield, Doheny noted that: ""Our lifetime spent at prospecting and our experience in developing oil in the vicinity of the exudes in California, constituted in us the proper frame of mind to fully appreciate the evidences of petroleum which existed in Mexico, and which undoubtedly had been seen by thousands of natives and perhaps a great many intelligent Mexicans and foreigners, who, however, by reason of not having had the proper experience which we had, were not sufficiently impressed to undertake the task of developing oil there, which task did not prove light, even though we went into it with health, strength, enthusiasm, and practically unlimited cash resources(The Catholic church....), and a great belief in our own judgment and good fortune.86 """"

Here is another excerpt that shows Doheny's ties with the economic goals of the Catholic Church. Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 127: ""As early as 1904, the United States Navy had released a report based on its own extensive experiments which detailed the superior results of fuel oil versus coal. But due to the unreliability of the supply, the navy had been unwilling to use oil except for ""special purposes and in particular localities."" At the time, the navy concluded that the commercial demand for petroleum products was so large that only about 3 percent of the world's requirements for marine (merchant and military) fuel could be offset by using oil. By the early 1910s, however, almost all of the military ships under construction had oil burners.55 The British Navy had been following the same path, and Weetman Pearson—now Lord Cowdray—made an aggressive bid to tie up his excess production from Mexico with the British Admiralty. Like Doheny, Cowdray hoped that his newly founded Eagle Transport Company would capture a major share of the oil-bunkering business that was just beginning to refashion the maritime fuel industry. The sixty oil tankers under construction in Britain during the summer of 1912 provided evidence of this transformation.56 Naturally, both Doheny and Cowdray wanted to promote this situation with their respective governments. In December 1913, Cowdray even tried to get the Royal Navy to invest in the Mexican Eagle Oil Company. But British officials had no interest in propping up Cowdray's enterprise at a time when Mexico was in turmoil. Furthermore, the Wilson Administration was hypersensitive about British relations with the Huerta regime and looked upon the British government as a pawn of Lord Cowdray. Then, when the British acquiesced to American control in Mexico in November 1913, they had no desire to prove Wilson right by signing an agreement with the Mexican Eagle. Given these constraints, the British Admiralty turned to the newly formed Anglo-Persian Oil Company and signed a long-term contract for naval fuel in May 1914. In the meantime, the British purchased fuel oil from the United States, and especially from Texas distributors, to meet their current demand. While heavy Mexican crude offset these shipments, it did not meet British fuel oil standards on its own.57""

I have already shown above that Ed Doheny was a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the holy Sepulcher .

Weetman Dickinson Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, GCVO, PC (15 July 1856 – 1 May 1927), known as Sir Weetman Pearson, Bt, between 1894 and 1910 and as The Baron Cowdray between 1910 and 1917, was a British engineer, oil industrialist, benefactor and Liberal politician. He was the owner of the Pearson conglomerate. Cowdray was in the Royal Victorian Order!(Vatican knighthood)In 1900 his company took over the construction of the Great Northern and City Railway in London and after completion in 1904 ran it for four years.[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 132: ""Doheny's choice of an Irish shamrock for the Mexpet logo suggested that he, too, had come to believe in his own good fortune. But such confidence(The Jesuit order backing youre company would make any CEO Confident....) seemed misplaced in the case of the California Petroleum Corporation, which came together just as the oil market hit another downturn. Although it was never in financial difficulty, the company failed to meet the high expectations of its investors. A snapshot of the industry in July 1913 showed that Calpet's producing subsidiaries, American Oilfields and American Petroleum, were among the strongest independents in the state. At that time, American Oilfields, which operated in the Midway oil district, was the largest and most important member of the Independent Oil Producers Agency. Of the 129 companies belonging to the Agency, American Oilfields alone produced 264,906 barrels of oil that month, or roughly 27 percent of the Agency's total production. In comparison, the next largest company was Nevada Petroleum, at 75,000 barrels a month, while the remaining companies averaged about 5,000 barrels apiece. The situation in Coalinga, where American Petroleum produced 186,317 barrels on contract with the Associated Oil Company, was not quite as strong. Still, American Petroleum accounted for 12 percent of the Associated's business. Overall, for the month under review, the combined production of the two companies made California Petroleum—at 451,223 barrels—fifth among the seven largest producers on the West Coast, after Union Oil at 843,871 barrels, Standard Oil at 751,906, Kern Trading and Oil Company (Southern Pacific) at 678,302, and Associated Oil Company at 564,840. Santa Fe (formerly a combination of Chanslor & Canfield Midway Oil and Petroleum Development) and General Petroleum Company were right behind, with 397,143 and 362,559 barrels, respectively.8 Facing another oil glut, however, Doheny used the cash received from floating Calpet to build an extensive storage network and cut back production to just meet his contract obligations. Planning for the future, though, he continued to buy up prospective oil land outside of the San Joaquin Valley. In doing so, Doheny was able to open and close various fields according to the market and, thus, gain control of a strategic combination of proven, but undeveloped, properties. This left him free to rely on his long-term contracts to the Independent Oil Producers Agency and Associated Oil during the bad times, and to open up new ""freelance"" properties, outside the control of either marketing organization, when prices went back up.9""

Doheny contributed money to foundations. He helped fund the construction of St. Vincent de Paul Church(Catholic). After the shooting death of his son, Edward Jr., he donated $1.1 million in 1932 to University of Southern California (USC) to build the Edward L. Doheny, Jr. Memorial Library.[40] His second wife, Carrie Estelle Doheny, donated her rare book collection to St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, California.

The Doheny Mansion, three miles south-west of Downtown Los Angeles, is the centrepiece of the Mount St. Mary's College Doheny Campus. Doheny, Sr., meanwhile, lived in his own mansion, which he had purchased in 1901.[41] It was part of Chester Place, a gated community of Victorian mansions, and by his death in 1935, Doheny ended up owning most of the houses, as well as the street.[31] Built in 1899 in the French Gothic architectural style, this three-story, twenty-two-room residence was damaged in the 1933 earthquake but was repaired. It is within Mount Saint Mary's University's Doheny campus, where it houses college departments, runs docent tours, and hosts chamber music concerts by The Da Camera Society. After he began basing his Mexican oil operations near Tampico, Tamaulipas in 1902, Doheny donated much money toward the construction and maintenance of the Cathedral of Tampico there. Also known as The Temple of the Immaculate Conception, it is located in Plaza de Armas in the city. The Doheny Estate has donated money to Loyola Marymount University(Jesuit) for the construction of buildings and residence halls, and the land for one of the campuses of Mount St. Mary's College south of downtown Los Angeles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Doheny#Philanthropy

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 148:""At the time America entered the war in the spring of 1917, business and industrial leaders of all types were becoming vital participants in the effort to bring the nation up to full strength. The demands of the war also made the security of the Mexican oil industry a primary concern for national defense and reinforced the strategic value of the California oil fields for the future. According to a recent study of the international oil industry during this period, there ""is no time when business competition is so heavily politicized as in war, which for business means a covert struggle for advantage under a publicly emphasized desire to serve the national interest."" Without question, Doheny took advantage of America's role in the war to propel himself and his company into national prominence. And as the next two chapters will show, it was almost impossible for him to draw a clear line between duty and opportunity during a national emergency.3 From the very beginning of the European conflict, there was every indication that oil would play a prominent role. In the fall of 1914, for example, an article entitled ""Gasoline and the War"" noted that oil had already become more important than food or ammunition. ""It has been an axiom of war since wars began,"" the author wrote, ""that an army travels on its belly .. . As it is now, an army travels on its gasoline."" The possession of oil, therefore, was essential to the prosecution of modern warfare. And right from the start, the United States served as the principal source of petroleum products to the Allied forces, especially for the fuel oil demands of the British Admiralty. American refineries along the Gulf Coast were particularly important in this trade, and heavy Mexican crude was used to replace the lighter products needed for the European theater. Mexican oil played an even larger role as an industrial fuel for American factories in the Northeast, where Doheny's companies dominated the business.4 ""

Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 126 :""The ability of the war to alter present circumstances was particularly evident when Doheny, Herbert Wylie, and George Henry returned from England on the final voyage of the Cunard liner Lusitania, before it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915. During the trip, Doheny was still conducting business as he and Wylie inspected the Lusitania's engines and boiler rooms in preparation for turning it into one of the first commercial vessels to burn oil. Doheny then outlined his plans for the British-Mexican company to Leonard Fanning, a well-known journalist for the oil press, as the Lusitania steamed into New York Harbor for the last time. Fanning wrote that two English companies would be formed: one to build tank stations and refineries throughout Europe and another to handle oil deliveries from Tampico. The Mexican Petroleum Company had a half-interest in the latter and a one-third share of the refining and sales operation. Mexican Petroleum would also receive a twenty-five-year contract for crude oil as soon as the parties signed the agreement.51 Doheny explained these arrangements to his stockholders a few months later and gave some specific reasons for taking the company's business so far afield. First of all, Doheny believed that they now owned ""the greatest of all oil properties"" in the world, which had already produced 50 million barrels of oil from a handful of wells. And since so many other wells were either closed in or seriously cut back, production could be increased fivefold at a moment's notice. This excess capacity demanded an extraordinary effort to find outlets for the oil.""

Wow right before the Jesuits used the sinking of the Lusitania as propaganda to drive the American public's support for entering World War 1, you have Papal Knight Edward Doheny making business negotiations on the Lusitania... and Doheny as quoted above in the source was on the last cruise of the Lusitana before It was used as a propaganda tool, just like how the Jesuits used Weapons of mass destruction to scare people after there artificially contrived 9/11, that had Jesuit Georgetown University professor Viet Dinh draft the Patriot Act as a response the staged attack...

Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 241 : ""Doheny emerged as a national leader of the oil industry in the late 1910s.

In 2021 Texas Republican Rep. Kyle Biedermann filed a bill calling for state-level secession from the US as “the federal government is out of control and does not represent the values of Texans.”

As Texas Republicans ended a three-day convention in Houston on June 18th, they revived the call for a referendum on whether the state should secede from the US, according to the Texas Tribune.

This was one of a plethora of measures called for in the Texas GOP's new party platform, which states under a section titled ""State Sovereignty"":

""Pursuant to Article 1, Section 1, of the Texas Constitution, the federal government has impaired our right of local self-government. Therefore, federally mandated legislation that infringes upon the 10th Amendment rights of Texas should be ignored, opposed, refused, and nullified.”

The document continues:

""Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto.""

The platform also reflected the Texas GOP’s demand that state Legislature pass a bill at its next session ""requiring a referendum in the 2023 general election for the people of Texas to determine whether or not the State of Texas should reassert its status as an independent nation.""

Republican discourse on secession is not new, with the idea floated by GOP officials from Wyoming, Florida, and Mississippi, among others. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry discussed secession at an April 2009 rally after Barack Obama claimed the presidency. Back in 2020, Texas Republican state Rep. Kyle Biedermann announced that he would introduce legislation to allow Texas to secede from the nation, saying that the “federal government is out of control and does not represent the values of Texans.”

I grew up in a very rural, Wyoming town with a population of around 400 people. Essentially, it is a cult. 400 people in the town, and yet five churches within city limits. There is a catholic church, there is a lutheran church, a baptist church, the assembly of God, and another non-denominational church that is less-frequented. Of course, then, the churches had their social cliques amongst the town. There are indeed crossovers, meaning a baptist and a catholic could be friends. However, if you did not go to a church on Sunday, you were outcast. 
While seemingly diverse, they all ""teach"" very similar things. I have attended all but the Lutheran church. They talk about Genesis: The Beginning, David and Goliath, Noah and the Whale, Jesus Christ, communion, and the *gasp* antichrist. 

Who is the antichrist? Or what is the antichrist spirit? I see so many sermons attempting to answer those questions. Countless preachers point the finger at Obama, Trump, or Biden. Well, here's the truth:

The antichrist are the very people claiming to worship Christ. The church is the antichrist. One of the things that most greatly divides us as a species is religion itself. Lives are lost for it; battles fought.

Why the separation between church and state?

The news about finding all these unmarked graves in Canada leads me to believe we are in unprecedented times. The Apocalypse, perhaps. This has been the greatest deception of mankind that I could ever fathom. I cannot bare the thought of the number of children murdered at the hands of the catholic church.

Last year, a lot of ink and bytes were spewed about county sheriffs who were going to ""block enforcement of unconstitutional 
laws"" or ""throw out federal personnel"". This was usually associated with gun-law, land-use or state-vs-federal authority issues.

As a contrarian kind of person, I set out to see if these personalities were really consistent about not wanting and/or not needing federal 'interference'.

I googled up some representative ""constitutional Sheriffs"" from [here](http://cspoa.org/), and the DoD's ""1033"" program list of ""MilToys"" given to law enforcement. Each constitutional sheriff is listed with his county's haul from the DoD, whether they're wired into a ""fusion center"", and whether they've been trained by The-most-moral-army-in-the-world[tm]:

----

Sheriff David Clarke, Milwaukee County, WI

Milwaukee County (WI):

68 Assault Rifles 5.56 and 7.62 MM ; Federal MilToys, check.

Southeastern Wisconsin Threat Analysis Center; Milwaukee, WI ; Fusion Center, check.

> In April 2011, Sheriff Clarke, along with a dozen American police chiefs and sheriffs, **traveled to Israel on a weeklong law enforcement executive training mission** sponsored by the American Israel Education Foundation. 

*What did your IDF trainers have to say about armed citizens, Sheriff?* ; Israeli Training, check.

----

Sheriff Nick Finch, Liberty County, FL

> On October 31, 2013, Sheriff Nick Finch won his case at trial in Liberty County, Florida. The charges were complete nonsense to begin with, and the laughter in the courtroom was difficult to suppress as the prosecution presented its flimsy, farcical case.

> [Arrest report here, from 2013](http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Liberty-County-Sheriffs-Office--210152161.html).

> [Not-Guilty verdict here](http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Court-Hearing-For-Former-Liberty-County-Sheriff-Nick-Finch-225879731.html).

Appears as though Mr. Finch walked his talk and made it stick. Good Cop, Free Donut!

Can't find evidence of them having sent LEOs to Israel for ""anti-terror training"".

SUMMARY: No one seems to be immune to the lure of ""free Federal MilToys"", not even the most anti-FedGov LEO offices. The 'fusion center' participation is also almost universal. Only one Sheriff actually owned up to attending [""crimaterror""](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/12/1044508/-Are-U-S-Police-training-with-the-Israeli-Military) training.

The data from various counties' websites is very uneven, and conventional journalistic / academic research methods will probably be necessary to draw a valid conclusion. Nevertheless, my short tour through this issue is enough to confirm my feeling that *to count on anyone in the ""Law-Man"" community to rise up and fight totalitarian FEMA-camp / Gun-confiscation / Mass-Land-Grab / Martial-Law scenarios* is futile.

I leave you with two (to me, anyway) depressing thoughts:

First, a pic I first saw on /r/historyporn - [The aftermath of the 1932 ""Bonus March""](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/hec/36900/36936v.jpg). At the time, this got me Googling around for a 'before', and [here it is](http://www.radiodiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/Bonus-Army_001_L.jpg). Look at all the flags, just like the Bundy Bunch was waving in the faces of the BLM's mercenaries. Fat lot of good it did them, huh? That camp wasn't flattened by some 1930s Marion Berry, either; but by [Douglas MacArthur](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/peopleevents/pandeAMEX89.html) and [George Patton](http://www.americaslibrary.gov/aa/patton/aa_patton_bonus_1.html) on orders of Secretary of War. Support the Troops, Hooah!

So much for ""Herp derp; the troops won't put up with Government abusing the people!""

Second, remember that ""faith in the local guys"" stuff I had at the top of this thing? Sorry, Mr. Faithful Patriot, you're *not going to be dealing with your local buddies* when it hits the fan. Example: Do you know who disarmed the high-and-dry, law-abiding citizens in New Orleans? The [Oklahoma National Guard](http://reason.com/archives/2005/09/10/defenseless-on-the-bayou) and the [California Highway Patrol](http://www.examiner.com/article/five-years-later-no-accountability-for-post-katrina-gun-grab). This wasn't some accident, either, it's *policy*, to 'encourage even-handed treatment' and preclude hesitation in following orders.

Happy Monday, y'all.

Pg. 33 “North America” 

     In North America the principal ecological- network driver is the Wildlands Project. Launched in 1991, the initiative aims to protect and restore the natural heritage of North America through the establishment of a connected system of “wildlands”, that is “reserve networks” compris- ing core areas, corridors and buffer zones (Noss, 1992). This is to be achieved through:

     • conserving a representative system of native ecosystems;
     • maintaining viable populations of all native species in their natural habitats;
     • maintaining ecological and evolution- ary processes;
     • ensuring adequate resilience of ecosys- tems and species.

     The Wildlands Project operates by promoting the ecological-network concept, advancing method- ologies and providing support to regional and local initiatives. This support comprises scientific research, conservation-planning methodologies and promoting partnerships with grassroots and national conservation organizations, government agencies, indigenous peoples, private landowners, naturalists, scientists and conservationists (see, for example, Soulé and Terborough, 1999). The following Wildlands projects have progressed to the preparation of a complete plan:

     • Heart of the West Wildlands Network Design, located in the Rocky Mountains and developed in collaboration with several other NGOs, including the Wild Utah Project and the Biodiversity Conservation Alliance;
     • Southern Rockies Wildlands Network Design, developed in cooperation with theSouthernRockiesEcosystemProject and the Denver Zoo (see box);
     • New Mexico Highlands Wildlands Network Design, located at the juncture of the Rocky Mountains, the Great
Plains, the Chihuahuan Desert and the
Great Basin;
     • Sky Islands Wildlands Network Design,
covering parts of Arizona and New Mexico (in collaboration with Naturalia, a Mexican NGO, work is underway to extend the network into Sonora and Chihuahua as the Northern Sierra Madre Wildlands Network Design — see below);
     • Southern Appalachian Conservation Plan;
     • Oregon Coast Range Conservation Plan, completed in the early 1990s and covering a relatively small area.

Several more Wildlands initiatives are working to prepare a plan:

     • Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y), extending along 3,200 kilometres of the northern Rocky Mountains from Wyoming to the Arctic Circle and initiated in collaboration with the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (although the project has since become an independent entity) — see also Tabor and Locke (2004)
     • Northern Sierra Madre Wildlands Network Design, a project launched in collaboration with the Mexican NGO Naturalia
     • Grand Canyon, an initiative still in an early phase
     • Colorado Plateau, again an initiative that is in an early phase
     • Northern Appalachians Wildlands Network Design, an initiative launched by a coalition of US and Canadian part- ners covering the New England states, theAdirondackMountainsofNewYork, Nova Scotia, parts of Newfoundland, Ontario and Quebec.
     • Oceans of Grass Wildlands Network,
focusing on the plains of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Wyoming and
North and South Dakota 
     • Florida Conservation 2000, an initative • that has been taken over and revised by
the Florida Nature Conservancy and
the state of Florida. 

     The work of the Wildlands Project focuses primarily on North America’s “megalinkages”, the continental-scale linkages that run north- south and east-west. Within each megalink- age, initiatives are taken to develop a cluster of ecological networks. For example, in the Spine of the Continent megalinkage running north to south from Alaska through the Rocky Mountains to Central America, six contiguous networks are under development: Yellowstone to Yukon, Heart of the West, the Southern Rockies, the New Mexico Highlands, the Sky Islands and the Northern Sierra Madre.
In addition to the work by the Wildlands Project, several other regional ecological-net- work initiatives are underway in North America. These include the following:

     • Conception Coast Project (California): the initiative covers a relatively small region and is still in an early phase.
     • Southern California Coastal Sage Scrub Natural Community Conservation Plan (California): the initiative again covers a relatively small region with an emphasis on strengthening connectivity.
     • Klamath-Siskiyou Bioregional Con- servation Plan (California and Oregon): the proposal covers a relatively small re- gion and the descriptive phase has been completed.
     • Ecosystem Recovery Project (Minnesota): this initiative is still in an early phase.
     • Corridors of Life (Montana): carried out by the NGO American Wildlands, the initiative is primarily focusing on connectivity planning and implemen- tation and is located within the Y2Y region.

     Southeastern Wildlands Project (Florida). Bioreserve Network (Southern Appal- achians): a plan has been prepared (which is also the South Appalachian Biosphere Reserve, SAMAB). 

    • Regional Reserve Network (British Columbia): plans have been prepared by the NGO Round River Conservation Studies for the Great Bear Rainforest and the coastal forest and mountains (in collaboration with the Transboundary Watershed Alliance, the Nature Conservancy of Alaska and the Nature Conservancy of Canada).

With regard to WWF initiatives, the following terrestrial ecoregion projects are being carried out in North America:

     • the Northern High Plains
     • the South Florida ecosystem
     • the Klamath-Siskiyou coniferous forests
     • southeastern rivers and streams

A further 10 to 15 NGO ecological-network initiatives in the US have failed to progress be- yond the original proposal for lack of funding, a problem that has become exacerbated for many US NGOs in recent years.

It's not just for tracking it's used as a torture device. ""No Touch Torture"".

""A notion that individuals must give informed consent in the United States is folly due to legal waivers used for research. For example, see Penn State’s documentation about this IRB (institutional review board) exception to the rule on its website: www.research.psu.edu/orp/humans/faqs/informed-consent

 A Wyoming Institute of Technology (WIT) 2014 publication “Analysis of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Chip Prevalence in 3 Discrete United States Populations“ reported that doctors tested 2955 Americans from different geographic locations and walks of life. The test subjects were stripped and scanned to determine if RFID chips could be detected. According to the research report abstract by John T. Brugle, Ph.D and Mary Franz, Ph.D, M.P.H.:

“This study analyzed the prevalence of RFID Chips in 3 geographically discrete populations and found that, on average, 1 in 3 individuals carried an RFID Chip. Interestingly, there was a strong correlation with RFID Chip presence and previous dental work.”

(This WIT report was later covered up as ""satire"" and the actual report cannot be accessed.)

The researchers’ findings concurred with those by former SS and FBI contractor, private investigator William Taylor when interviewed by Deborah Dupré in 2011 for her 4-Part Series, Secertly Forced Brain Implants. Dentists are implanting both adults and children, Taylor had said. In the 2014 research report, the authors sated that most chips they detected in individuals in their study had been forcibly inserted by dentists during dental work, such as fillings, bridges, crowns, etc. 

The dentists never inform patients before the device is placed in their body, they never get the patient’s informed consent, and the patient is usually unaware of the existence of the chip(s) – for the time being, unless they are targeted for persecution, further experimentation and/or no-touch torture.

A report in The Open Dentistry Journal explains:

A general dentist without any special training or assistance from a laboratory technician can easily perform the incorporation of a microchip transponder in a denture and the procedure is extremely economical. Its inclusion offers many benefits in dental prosthetic labeling; allowing not only the storage of patient’s medical records on a searchable database, but also information on the materials used and so providing traceability. Ultimately the chip could play an invaluable forensic role in assisting with human identification.""

The rest of the states remain the same from 2016, and Biden in theory wins the election 270-268. However, a faithless elector either abstains from voting for Biden or throws his vote away on a third party candidate, causing the electoral total to be 269-268, meaning neither candidate has a majority and the election goes to the House of Representatives. As it stands, each state delegation gets one vote regardless of the number of representatives it has. Therefore states like Wyoming and Montana, who have 1 representative, have the same number of votes as California, which has 53 representatives. A majority of 26 states is needed to select a president. Currently, Republicans have the majority of representatives in 26 states, which is the minimum needed to select the president. So Trump would essentially win again by piggybacking off of those low population Midwest states who (in this system) have the same voting power as states like California and New York. Seeing how upset Democrats were with the electoral college in 2016, I can't imagine they would take this lightly. There would be riots across the country yet again.

Now just imagine in the week after the election another black man is killed by the police in the same style as George Floyd and the story makes national headlines. Additionally, a 'right-wing terrorist' commits a deadly mass-shooting targeting minorities. Despite the unrest and severe racial tensions, Trump goes on Twitter and condemns BLM. At that point, given the state of our country, a civil war almost seems inevitable. That's the most likely scenario I can see that would almost guarantee war.",conspiracy,Wyoming

*Are you certain that you’ll reap what you’ve sown?*

For the moment, I seek to address those in the southwestern portion of the United States of America & ask those reading from elsewhere to keep an open mind & an open eye. We’re just about halfway into our summer season but we’re nowhere near close to beginning the actual battles that’ll come in respect to water rights & land rights for those in the southwest & eventually the entire nation.

As most are aware, more than a few bodies of water & rivers they connect to are depleting at exigent rates like Lake Powell, Lake Mead & the Colorado River Basin. To note, the “U.S. Bureau of Reclamation officials gave all seven states until August 15 to create a plan to save between 2 million and 4 million acre-feet of water. If they fail, the federal government will take control and impose its own cuts as water use exceeds supply and an ongoing megadrought continues to sap water from the Colorado River.” To clarify, the seven states in question are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah & Wyoming – by August 15th, nearly 40 million people will be subject to regulations & contractual agreements they’ll probably be hearing about for the first time.

Though one could dive deeper into the legal acumen involving water use, I will not be doing that here. I am admittedly more concerned with the present nature of genetic ownership in regards to gardening & farming – I find the issue to be a bit more murky than Leak Mead is at the moment & I believe predetermined agreements between corporations & legislative bodies will exacerbate any water issue regardless of civilian conservation efforts going forward.",conspiracy,Wyoming

Philip Giraldi UNZ",0.0,63jk9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63jk9a/if_the_kremlin_did_it_then_the_dnc_and_clinton/,1.0,1491368644.0,"The latest Democratic Party shill to demonize Russia is, I am ashamed to say, my state of Virginia’s Senator Mark Warner, who, on Thursday said “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a deliberate campaign carefully constructed to undermine our election.” Last Thursday, Warner was the top Democrat on a Senate Intelligence Committee panel investigating Moscow’s alleged interference in last year’s presidential election. The panel inevitably included carefully selected expert witnesses who would agree with the proposition that Russia is and was guilty as charged. There was no one who provided an alternative view even though a little Googling would have surfaced some genuine experts who dispute the prevailing narrative.

Warner joined many of his esteemed colleagues in Congress who have completely accepted the allegations that Russia meddled in the election in spite of the failure of the Obama Administration to provide any indisputable evidence to that effect. Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland has called Moscow’s claimed interference an “attack” and labeled it a “political Pearl Harbor.” A number of other congressmen, to include Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey and Eric Swalwell of California have called it an act of war. And then there are echo chambers Senators John McCain and Mark Rubio on the Republican side of the aisle while former Vice President Dick Cheney was speaking at a business conference in New Delhi saying the same thing. Yes, that Dick Cheney. Why anyone in India would pay to hear him speak on any subject escapes me.

Democrat Adam Schiff of California is leading the charge for his party as he is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. He outlined his case against Russia two weeks ago, providing a heap of minimally factual “information”, relying heavily instead on supposition and featuring mostly innuendo. And again, it was largely evidence-free. One assertion is almost comical: “In July 2016, Carter Page, one of Trump’s former national security advisers, traveled to Moscow after being approved to do so by the Trump campaign. While there, Page gave a speech in which he was critical of the U.S. and its efforts to fight corruption and promote democracy.”

Almost everyone I know who follows such matters is also critical of U.S. (hypocritical) efforts to promote democracy, a formulation wildly popular among Hillary Clinton style Democrats to enable attacking Muslim countries that have somehow offended either Israel or the Washington Establishment. But what is particularly disturbing about the constant denigration of Russia and Vladimir Putin in the media and among the political class is the regular invocation of war doctrine, that hacking a server by a foreign power, if it took place, is in the same category as the attack on Pearl Harbor. That World War 3 would be a nuclear holocaust does not seem to have occurred to politicians seeking a punchy line so they can get cited in The Washington Post. It leads one to the inevitable conclusion that war is far too serious a business to be left to politicians.

But what particularly offends me personally about those eager to go toe to toe with the Russians is their complete venality and fundamental cowardice. As a Vietnam era vet, I understand full well how it feels to have your life disrupted to go off and possibly die to fight a war that was totally meaningless. Our crowd of politicians is fond of talking about war as if it were some kind of diversion being featured on a monopoly board and that is precisely because they have no skin in the game. They somehow fancy that a shooting war will somehow not happen, that Russia will back down in a confrontation with force majeur, and they deep down feel completely immune to the consequences that might result from their ill-advised actions. And they are unfortunately in large part correct to feel so, as no one was ever held accountable for Iraq. Consequences that apply to the “little people” in the U.S. do not apply to them.

Under the rule of our bipartisan war-loving elites the United States has evolved from a bumbling giant into something far more threatening. The completely useless wars since 9/11 have killed nearly 10,000 American soldiers and contractors as well as hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the inhabitants of the countries that we have attacked. I would hold Congress, the White House and the mainstream media as directly responsible for those deaths. As former Ambassador Chas Freeman puts it, “America has now chosen publicly to redefine itself internationally as the foreign relations equivalent of a sociopath – a country indifferent to the rules, the consequences for others of its ignoring them, and the reliability of its word. No nation can now comfortably entrust its prosperity or security to Washington, no matter how militarily powerful it perceives America to be.”

Which inevitably leads to the subject of Dick Cheney. When it comes to hypocrisy over war as a constant state for the American Republic with absolutely no consequences for those who lead, no one takes a back seat to good old Dick. Dick had five deferments during Vietnam and he has explained that he had had “other priorities.” He and his consigliere Scooter Libby, together with Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon, might have had more to do with America’s march to war in Iraq than any other individuals in the Bush Administration. And none of them paid any price except Libby who was convicted of having committed perjury connected to his apparent outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame as revenge for her husband’s refutation of claims about Iraq buying uranium from Niger. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison but had his jail time commuted by President George W. Bush.

One might even suggest that the architects of devastating policies were actually rewarded, most particularly Wolfowitz, who was named president of the World Bank before having to resign over a sex scandal that he initiated. Today Wolfowitz is a Visiting Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and Libby is a Senior Vice President at the neocon Hudson Institute. Cheney is retired comfortably on the somewhere between $19 and $86 million he made, mostly while working for five years at defense contractor Halliburton. His truly frightening daughter Liz is in congress representing Wyoming, continuing the family legacy of bone headed knee jerk reactionaryism combined with egregious self-aggrandizement that Dick is best known for.

Note that neither Cheney, nor Wolfowitz nor Libby ever served in the U.S. military, exhibiting thereby their willingness to let other American die for the dreadful policies that they initiated. That pattern also holds true for the Democrats who seem to have found Russia as a useful scapegoat for their failure to elect Hillary Clinton president. If the Kremlin did it then the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign are off the hook, aren’t they? And even better if one can simultaneously discredit Donald Trump by implying that he or his associates might be subjected to blackmail by Moscow, making them little more than agents of Vladimir Putin and therefore traitors to the United States.

Senator Mark Warner, a lawyer by training, founded a venture capital firm called Columbia Capital before being elected Governor of Virginia and then Senator in 2008. He is reported to be the wealthiest U.S. Senator, worth $200 million. He has a 15 acre farm in Rappahannock County Virginia where he produces wine as a hobby.

Warner has three daughters who will never serve in the U.S. military, which is precisely the problem. The more our “ruling class” in Washington has little or nothing to do with the average American or, to be more precise, the class of Americans called upon to fight and die in the wars that are constantly being promoted, the more we will engage in senseless wars and sabre rattling. As Warner appears willing to use the threat of war to pillory Trump, he perhaps should step back, take a deep breath, and try to think of the consequences of the politically loaded claims that he is promoting.

Ben Cardin and Adam Schiff are a lot like Warner in that they are reliable partisan Democrats who are seeking to milk as much benefit out of beating on Russia as they can. Both are unimpeachable liberals who wrap their arguments in the good old American flag by claiming that Moscow is seeking to threaten our democracy while completely ignoring the fact that the U.S. intelligence agencies have been regularly overthrowing governments and corrupting elections since the Second World War. They both have children who will never serve in uniform or see the inside of a barracks. War for them is an abstraction which serves as a useful tool, in this case, for bringing down Donald Trump. And they are bringing down with Trump any hope of rapprochement with Russia, a readjustment in policy that is desperately needed.

I am reminded frequently of the ancient Greek way of war. Armor was expensive and only the wealthy and powerful could afford it. And those with the armor stood in the front line as they were most able to engage in the cutting and thrusting and still survive. Armor was also heavy and they could not run away, so wars were only fought when vital interests were at stake and they were fought to the death for most of those on the battlefield. I fancy a phalanx of hoplites with Warner, Cardin, Schiff, Wolfowitz, Cheney and Libby arrayed on the front line in their fine armor manufactured by Halliburton. That way they could have all the war they want and experience it first-hand. I doubt they would last very long as they are both moral and physical cowards, but given that reality, they just might think a bit harder about promoting the type of fearmongering that will only end by sending the children of other Americans off to war.

I lived at 43 Broadway in Brooklyn.  From my fire escape, I could see the Twin Towers.  During my nap I had a dream of a small white buffalo doing battle against a large brown buffalo.  I will detail the dream, but first I'd like to say that I am only offering this material for speculative consumption.  I have many other verifiable, tangible connections to the Twin Towers and the events of 9/11 which are detailed in my documentary, ""The Tower Age"".  But I limited the scope of that piece so that it only includes items for which I have documentary proof.  Obviously I cannot prove that I dreamt a white buffalo on 9/9 so I did not include that fact.  But I have often wondered what the white buffalo might mean, if anything.  Does this dream contain any clues that might help the quest for the truth of 9/11?  If you are open to this kind of thought experiment, read on.  Perhaps it could trigger a connection which you yourself had not yet made.  So, to the dream:

There was a small white buffalo standing on a hill, in profile, its horns pointing to the right.  On the right was a very large brown buffalo—much larger than the white buffalo.  Its considerably larger horns were pointing to the left, though its head was lowered.  It was as if they were about to do battle, but the odds were clearly in favour of the towering brown buffalo.  But suddenly, without warning, the white buffalo charged at the brown buffalo, goring its horns into the eye sockets of the brown buffalo.  As the white buffalo dislodged it horns, it was clear that the brown buffalo had been blinded: blood was dripping from the empty eye sockets.  And the beast was in excruciating pain.  I remember thinking within the dream that the brown buffalo was now very dangerous because it was wounded—as wild animals often are when they have been bloodied.  

In the next instant, without warning, the white buffalo charged again, this time driving its right horn into the left cheek of the brown buffalo.  As the brown buffalo was being gored, it let out a howl of tortured pain.  And it was at that moment that I jolted awake.  As I came to my senses, I realised that the sound from within my dream—the agonising howl that had awoken me—was actually an NYC bus at the bus stop across the street from my apartment.  Evidently, the bus had just fired up its hydraulic system as it prepared to depart.

I used to think that the white buffalo represented something good and divine.  But after 14 years, I have come to believe that the white buffalo might actually represent dark forces.  A white buffalo was [born in Wyoming in 1997](http://www.marythunder.com/Animals/Buffaloes/SacredWhiteBuffaloes/MiracleMoonWhiteBuffalo.htm).

150,Jack the Dripper,0.0,7alpob,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7alpob/jack_the_dripper/,4.0,1509737217.0,"Horoscope for Jackson Pollock; Born January 28, 1912 in Cody, Wyoming:

Born under the sun Sign of Aquarius, Pollock is unquestionably a major league player in the Age of Aquarius. The best-loved Sign of the Zodiac, it is significant that Aquarius follows Capricorn in the order of the Zodiac. As Capricorn rules politics, so Aquarius rules parties, that is, followers. Think of Pollock as a card-carrying party member of the Abstract Expressionist movement. ""Action Painting,"" as it was popularly known, was America's first major contribution to the history of art. It is said to be quintessentially American.

Moon is in Taurus. Moon is said by astrologers to be exalted in Taurus. By that they mean the subject of such an aspect will experience conspicuous honor in life. Indeed, like a hero carried upon the shoulders of his adoring supporters, Pollock became a *cause célèbre.* Moon moves the tides, makes waves. Of the abstract painter Pollock it may be said of him without exaggerating that he made a splash. Taurus is an Earth Sign, grounded, like a lightning rod. Perhaps like a bolt of lightning would be a better simile? 

Mercury in Capricorn leads to the notion of thinking politically. Recall the archival photo images of Pollock in his studio; in many he is in motion, but in others, Pollock pauses, reflects. These photos remind me of a general plotting his campaign in a war room, as he leans over a map table, plotting. No subordinates are to be seen these photos. It’s Pollock’s war.

Sagittarius is said to be the sigh of ""living large,"" and Pollock's natal Venus shows what he really loved. Has anyone never experienced the wall-size scale of his most important paintings? New York City large, that is. Venus is the lesser good fortune planet. Behavior that would have put a mere mortal at risk didn't catch up to him until the end. 

Mars in Taurus, again the military tilt, like the pagan god of war in his culture bunker. As a matter of fact, Pollock's natal Mars is in the 29th-and-final Degree of the Sign; ""on the cusp,"" as we astrologers say.

Jupiter, the major good fortune planet, is in Sagittarius. Jupiter rules in Sagittarius, sits upon the throne there, so to speak. If Venus is a man's get-out-of-jail-for-free card, Jupiter means winnings, and considering the price of a significant Pollock, worth a king's ransom. 

With Saturn in Taurus that makes three planets in the same Sign -and the burden of fate. Saturn is the planet of major misfortune. Look at what it affects in the native's life -and his death. In the same sign as Pollock's exalted moon, Saturn afflicts that very exaltation. A slow, heavy planet, Saturn is dignified in its Sign of rulership, but in the powerful motion Sign of Taurus, it is the proverbial train wreck. It was in a car crash Pollock died. He was driving too fast for conditions and under the influence. Some say suicide. I think he was distracted by two women passengers. ",conspiracy,Wyoming

Vermont? Deleware?

No. There are simply not as many states as the US claims to have. Now, why would they lie about this? To seem stronger and bigger than they are, even to the people who live here. It is to create a false sense of power, drive patriotism with the size of the country, make us look like we have a bigger population than we do. There is no way that all 50 states can be real and be as big as they are claimed to be. Some states like Nevada do have popular places 'in the state' like Los vegas, I am not saying Los vegas isn't real, it is, but it isn't in Nevada, they want us to think it is so when someone realizes Nevada isn't real, people can say they have been there because they were in Los vegas. Some, like Vermont and Deleware, are not real but have been written into the history of the country in order to raise youth not to question the validity of that state.

Alabama? I can't be sure, we may have Alabama jokes to make us think it is a real place.

Alaska? This I believe is real, though I do not believe it is as big as we are made to believe.

Arizona? Real, though because of the desert, not much is inhabitable, so it is smaller than we are told because they don't expect people to explore every bit of desert.

Arkansas? Again, with this one, I am not sure, though I am leaning towards real, the only thing throwing me off is the name, so close to Kansas? Perhaps they just couldn't think of a name, perhaps they were lazy.

California? Real, but again it is smaller than we are told.

Colorado? Real.

Connecticut? Not real, we are raised to believe it is but it is not.

Deleware. Not real.

Florida? Real, though possibly not as big as we are told.

Georgia? Real, again, not as big as we are told.

Hawaii? Real.

Idaho? It is real, but they claim there is more farmland than there is.

Illinois? Not real.

Indiana? real.

Iowa? Real, but again with more farmland claimed than there really is.

Kansas? Real.

Kentucky? Not real, we are told fried chicken is from there so we believe it is a real place.

Louisiana? Not real, there are casinos 'there' but they are really in bordering states and we are told they are in Louisiana so we think it's real.

Maine? Real.

Maryland? Not real. We hear about Baltimore so we think it's real, but it's not.

Massachusetts? Not real, the same thing as Baltimore, we only hear about Boston so we think it's real.

Michigan? Not real, same thing, we hear about Detriot, but it's not real.

Minnesota? Real.

Missisippi? Not real, there are jokes about it being hard to spell so we think it's real, but it's not.

Montana? Real.

Nebraska? Real, but smaller than we are told.

Nevada? Not real, Los vegas is in a neighboring state and claimed to be in Nevada.

New Hampshire? Not real, no states with ''new'' are real except york.

New jersey? Not real.

New Mexico? Not real, they do have Roswell, which I have been to, but Roswell is not in New Mexico.

New York? Real.

North Carolina? Real, but smaller than claimed.

North Dakota? Not real.

Ohio? Real, but smaller.

Oklahoma? Real, but smaller.

Oregan? Not real, we only hear about Portland to make us think it's real.

Pennsylvania? Not real, the 'ia' it ends in seems Slavic in origin and I do not believe the US would really have a state that seems Slavic.

Rhode Island? Real, but smaller.

South Carolina? Real, but smaller.

South Dakota? Not real.

Tennesee? Real, but smaller than claimed.

Texas? Real, but much smaller than we are led to believe.

Utah? Not real, we think Mormons come from there so we think it's real.

Similar proposals for an amendment to the constitution were put forward before, but, as you might guess, they did not bear fruit - both Democrats and Republicans from small states were always opposed.

&#x200B;

I became interested in the weight of votes of voters from different districts in the elections. Due to the fact that the election system is not direct, but through the Electoral College, there is an interesting bias in the vote, which sometimes (only four times in history: 1876, 1888, 2000, 2016) results in the candidate for whom the majority of voters do not win the election, since the majority of electors did not vote for him. A simple ratio of the number of voters to one electoral unit in the state can be seen on the KDPV. But this ratio simply divides all residents in the state by the number of electors (usually their number is equal to the number of senators, plus representatives from the state). If we take into account the unequal distribution of citizens among the constituencies themselves, the spread will turn out even more interesting.

&#x200B;

Squeeze four districts out of 435, per elector:

\- Wyoming Congressional District (at Large) - 184,781

\- Congressional District 1 Rhode Island - 251,273

\- Congressional District 7 Texas - 687,212

\- Congressional District 30 California - 691.188

&#x200B;

Total, the voice of a resident of Wyoming is 3.7 times more powerful than the voice of a resident of the 30th district of California. In the Wyoming example, this is due to the modest number of residents, they have only one representative. But even in comparison with Rhode Island, where there are two representatives, the difference in the weight of votes is also significant. If anyone is interested in the results for their districts, I can post a full list.

&#x200B;

It becomes clear why the congressmen of small states oppose the introduction of direct voting - it balances the votes of citizens, well, what a decent Wyoming person would agree to.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, such an electoral system at one time became a compromise between those who wanted completely direct presidential elections and those who wanted congressmen to elect the president.

&#x200B;

Of the arguments back in 1787 were:

\- the election process was not well organized, there was space for serious manipulations (there was less manipulation);

\- people in the country do not have enough information about all candidates, sometimes people vote for the dead (which is happening now - the dead even win the election);

\- slaves in the south did not have the right to vote, but were considered by the population (the same story with illegal immigrants in the south - they are counted in the census, but do not have the right to vote);

\- the interests of small states are not taken into account (check);

\- The founding fathers did not trust the direct choice because of the manipulability of the population, see Notes of the Federalist, A. Hamilton, N68 (sapienti sat).

&#x200B;

What do dear readers think about direct elections? Is it time to enter, or does the laying of the electors still protect against the listed disadvantages? What to do with unequal weights of voices, is there a sense and opportunity to somehow balance them in another way?

Say we cut emissions 10% would that lead to a .5 degree reduction? No one can say. So we're just going to rush into full on structural changes driven by emotion, without knowing what the benefit will be? We cant even say there would be a benefit.
There is an enormous economic risk, especially if you look at the proposals of this completely insane green new deal. No air travel? Complete refabrication of every tall building in the country? Who are you going to trust to save the planet for us. The government? They get involved and it just sets up a scenario of carbon tax, and huge companies then purchase carbon offsets by paying for a tree planting somewhere. So you polluted this much carbon, but you planted this many trees so it offsets. Thats how this works in practice.

I think part of the disconnect is how people view the government. Government ruins. Government is not our friend. We dont want them to control our healthcare and we dont want them to save the planet for us. That gives them way too much power to abuse and ruin things like they do in nearly every situation. It creates serious unforeseen conflicts of interest. Just look at whats happening in LA. They have a homelessness comittee that has spent over 1 billion tax dollars building low cost or rent free apartments for the homeless. They started this 3 years ago, they were supposed to finish 3 buildings 2 years ago, and over a billion dollars later, there isnt a single home available. The 3rd committee head just resigned and they are right back where they started. They make problems worse when we ask for their help. And when people in the government start promoting extreme apocalyptic fear and sky is falling doomsday scenarios, you should ALWAYS take that with a grain of salt. Why are they promoting fear? What are they trying to induce you to do or think? They ultimately want a blank check and for us to say ""we're scared, save our planet for us. Whatever it takes"" Yes sir right away. You asked for it.

When you dont know the whole picture, you tend to take actions that end up making things worse. In 2009 obama made the incadescent lightbulb illegal to produce or sell in the US. All lightbulbs sold from then on would be flourescents. We were told how much carbon this would save, and how great it would be for our environment. Then they began doing environmental impact studies and they found the environmental and health damage being done by the mercury in these bulbs far outweighed any benefit from slightly reduced emissions. So a year later he scrapped the law, and now you can go to home depot and buy incandescent bulbs. But in the meantime some companies lost a lot of money. Other companies MADE a lot of money by becomming the exclusive flourescent provider to the military and the gov't. Thats the type of racketeering potential and conflicts of interest things like this create in practice. Thats the only real world purpose they will serve.

And theres not even a clear objective here, so it just remains open ended constantly changing and ripe for abuse inefficiency and corruption. And we're rushing into it based on emotion and angry little girls saying ""how dare you"" These climate change predictions are a lot like false preachers who predict the end of the world over and over again. Its like Y2k. First it was acid rain in the 70's, then it was a hole in the ozone layer in the 90's, then it was global warming, and now they want to call it climate change. But these prophecies never come true so they just move the goalposts and change the wording. Of course the climate is changing. The very definition of the word climate means that its a constantly changing phenomenon. I dont know if you saw Al gores movie in '05. He showed climate model projections that showed miami beach completely under water by 2020. Al Gore owns a multimillion dollar mansion on miami beach and has for 10 years. You think he would invest millions in a house that should be under water? Even they know its BS. This is just the latest wave of the same old disproven prophecies

Also we cant just look at the world and say man it would be nice if we didnt clear so many rainforests for cattle. Or if we had renewable energy. But that fails to consider he functional reality of the world. We collectively agreed that fossil fuels were the best energy source that suits most peoples purposes in the world. We had to develop that conclusion over 200 years. No one just woke up and said today im going to make gas and oil the worlds primary energy sources. Societies had to adapt to that and develop it over many years and it had to be compatible with billions of peoples use and ways of life. We cant waive a magic wand and change that. Its a functional reality that developed over a long time with a lot of moving parts and interdependencies. You cant look at it in a vacuum. It didnt show up overnight, and you cant get rid of it overnight especially for some unquantifiable unproveable hope that it reduces temperature somehow.
Its funny to me how these climate change concepts line up so conveniently with our judeo-christian mindsets of atonement and repentance. It even goes back to our pagan roots. We have this inborn concept that we have to sacrifice something to show gratitude to the earth mother. We have to ask forgiveness and repent for our sinful climate damaging ways. Its a fairytale. its a social construct that very conveniently aligns with our guilty religious and evolutionary natures, peddled largely by people who consider themselves scientific athiests ,weirdly enough.
The media wants you to feel like youre the problem. That you need to peddle to work and recycle because your life is so comfortable and you need to ""do your part"" This is ridiculous. 80% of the carbon emission in this country are from 10 corporations industrial plants. If every single person in this country trashed their car and biked to work it would reduce carbon emission in the US by only 15 percent at best.

And looking from a global level its even less. China and India alone are responsible for nearly 60% of all global carbon emissions. the US is responsible for less than 14% of all global carbon emissions. So even if we shut down our country today, that would be a drop in the bucket, and we'd all still be doomed according to climate change activists.

So its open ended,undefined, uncertain, extremely high potential for corruption and abuse, and its all being driven by fear peddling, disproven doomsday prohecies that have come and passed, childish emotions, and speculation. We know these things for sure. What we dont know is how much reduced pollution equals how much saving of the planet.

And one more thing to add. I think most of the people saying we have the ability to ""kill the planet"" havent seen very much of it. Just get out and look for yourself. Got up to the redwoods and yellowstone and the grand canyon and look around. Go to montana and the vast open planes of kansas and wyoming. Go to the rocky mountains. Now tell me that any human or humans could murder the grand canyon or the rocky mountains. Its impossible. The sun came up today like it did this same time 100,000 years ago. Streams flowed and carved out the vast grand canyon hundreds of thousands of years ago. You think we can destroy that with a little carbon emissons? come on. Stop being controlled by fear and guilt and comic book type doomsday scenarios from someones fiction filled imagination.

0,Should the U.S. Senate be abolished?,686.0,me0oav,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/me0oav/should_the_us_senate_be_abolished/,1099.0,1616799329.0,"Before the Seventeenth Amendment to the US Constitution was passed in 1913, the senators of each state were elected by the state legislatures rather than through direct election by popular vote. This original setup was not surprising considering the fact that the Founding Fathers intended the Senate as the upper house to consist of ""better"" men who are wealthier and wiser and act as a stabilising force that counters the popularly elected House of Representatives.

However, this was not the only intended purpose of the Senate. The other is to represent distinct constituencies from the House of Representatives, the individual states themselves rather than the voters. In fact, it was included in the Constitutional Convention as part of the [Connecticut Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise) between the large states and small states to require that the upper house be weighed equally among the states with each having two representatives. With this, the states would have equal representation in one of two houses of the legislature regardless of their population sizes.

However, critics have described the fact that representation in the Senate is not proportional to the population as ""anti-democratic"" and ""minority rule"". [Moreover, because small states are disproportionately non-Hispanic European American, African Americans have 75% of their proportionate voting power in the Senate, and Hispanic Americans have just 55%.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/opinion/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate.html)

For the most extreme example, California has almost 40 million people while Wyoming has only just over 0.5 million people. They both get two Senators.

Aside from his character flaws, do they oppose him because he is too conservative and thus turns off moderates or is not conservative enough and thus turns off constitutionalists?

For an example of the former is his stance on immigration and being an America Firster where he is labeled a hardline immigration restrictionist and an anti-globalist in the mold of Pat Buchanan. For an example of the latter is his stance on debt and deficits and government action where Trump doesn't care about the size of government and is willing to use government force against his political opponents, real or imagined.

Alternatively, some Never Trumpers argue that Trump is a menace regardless of his policy positions and should not hold office 
 or deserves political influence because of that. Meaning, that even if he flipped and returned to being a Democrat it wouldn't change their view of him.

*One poll from August 2015, definitely not reliable.

I am not going to make this a conversation about whether or not the polls are accurate/reliable after the Michigan polling debacle because we really don't have a conclusively way of knowing. However I do find it unlikely that Michigan will repeat itself considering it was an unprecedented and historic polling error.

I have heard from many supporters of Sanders that after March 15th states start to look favorable to Bernie since the south is over. So to see how important March 15th is, we need to look ahead on the calendar: 



Date | State | Delegates | Type | Current Polls

 | Idaho | 23 | Open Caucus | [Sanders +2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/id/idaho_democratic_presidential_caucus-5801.html)

 | **Total** | **620** |  | 

Please note that polling for these states is pretty weak considering some of the polls are old and only a few have been done.

So now if you compare the two tables you will see that March 15th has more delegates at stake than the following 9 states combined. I know the polling is weak but I am not seeing where the Bernie friendly states are coming from based on the polls coming out of New York and Arizona. 

Let's do a little more math now. From a Sanders perspective, I am going to be optimistic in this scenario:

* Bernie over-performs March 15th and manages to walk away with 45% of the delegates
* Over the course of the next month Bernie gains momentum and is able to make up for all of the delegates Hillary gained on March 15th. In the 14 states listed above Clinton takes 655 delegates, Sanders 656
* Going into April 26 the delegate totals stand at Clinton: 1,427; Sanders: 1,205 (the same spread as of now not counting Super Delegates)
* The target delegate amount to secure nomination is 2,026. Clinton would need 599 delegates to secure the nomination and Sanders would need 821 out of 1,413 total remaining delegates.
* This would mean that Sanders would need 58% of all of the available delegates post April 19th.

**Conclusion:** In this super friendly scenario to Sanders, he still loses the nomination pretty easily unless he can swing massive (20+ point) wins in California, NJ, and basically every state post April 19th. 

To even have a chance at the nomination, it looks like Sanders can't just over-perform on March 15th. He needs to win about 381 of the 691 delegates or 55%. If that happens then I will be a believer in his chances to win.

**I'm hoping this doesn't come off as an anti-Sanders, pro-Hillary shitpost. I just wanted to look at the numbers as objectively as I could and do a bit of low level analysis. Also if any of my math or delegate totals are wrong please let me know!*

Questions/Points of Discussion:

* What result will Bernie need to achieve on Tuesday for your opinion to swing in his favor (in terms of being the favorite)?
* Do you think NY and California being so late in the nomination calendar have helped or hurt Bernie?
* What current pro-Hillary states are most likely to swing to Bernie's favor?

* Michigan

After a closer-than-expected loss in his 2018 Senate run, Republican John James became a hot commodity for the GOP. [Both House and Senate leadership wanted to recruit him](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/michigans-john-james-2020-1421844), with him opting for the latter, [running against Democratic incumbent Sen. Gary Peters](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/john-james-senate-michigan-1511229). In addition to losing a star recruit for a swing district, GOP House leadership is reportedly worried that James might give Peters a run for his money in what's a traditionally blue state and force Democrats to invest more money there, thus [jeopardizing Trump's chances](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/22/trump-campaign-michigan-reelection-1507282). In 2016, the President won Michigan by about 10000 votes, so there's not a lot of room for error.


 * Wyoming

Four-term Republican incumbent [Sen. Mike Enzi announced his retirement](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/04/wyoming-sen-mike-enzi-will-not-run-for-reelection-next-year-1301637) earlier this year, and the GOP has been abuzz about Rep. Liz Cheney ever since. Cheney currently serves as Chair of the Republican House Conference, but Republican Senators and aides believe she's very likely to jump ship and run for the Senate seat. There's already one high-profile candidate in that race, however: Former Rep. [Cynthia Lummis](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/20/cynthia-lummis-senate-wyoming-1374053), Cheney's predecessor. Lummis most notably has the backing of Sen. Rand Paul and likeminded dovish conservatives, while the more hawkish wing of the party - Sens. Lindsay Graham, Joni Ernst, and even Mitch McConnell - are eager to see Cheney join their ranks in the Senate. With Wyoming being ruby red, the general election isn't going to matter a whole lot, but people on both sides of the [Lummis/Cheney](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/22/rand-paul-liz-cheney-senate-wyoming-1506603) divide say this is the race that is most likely to impact the post-Trump Republican Party. The primary is on August 18th.


* Massachusetts

[Rep. Joe Kennedy III recently announced a primary challenge](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/21/ed-markey-joe-kennedy-senate-seat-clash-1507045) to incumbent Sen. Ed Markey. Like in Wyoming, the general election in Massachusetts is a foregone conclusion, but Democrats are worried that a potentially divisive primary might be nationalized due to the Kennedy name and the generational change narrative that's been in the news lately. Kennedy is already leading in the polls and has the backing of quite a few labor unions, as well as Sen. Kyrsten Synema. [Markey, on the other hand, has the backing of many Senate colleagues](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/10/ed-markey-senate-democrats-1487971), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which might lessen the whole generational change story. The primary is on September 15th.

What do you think about the attention these races have been getting so early in the election cycle? Are any of these concerns warranted? Do you see any of them impacting or distracting from the general election? I know there's still about a year to go until the primaries and the general, but how do you think these three races will pan out?

What if electoral votes were distributed exactly proportionally with the popular vote on a state by state basis?

You've got fractional votes, sure, but you still give the smaller states their disproportionate weight while still making every vote count. You could still have something similar to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact where the states grant their votes to whoever wins that system (I guess you'd have to go with who had the most votes and not who had 270 due to 3rd parties getting votes). 

Does this work to bridge the divide between the pro Popular Vote and pro Electoral College crowds? Would this stand a better chance of being passed than other proposed reforms? Is there anything inherently idiotic about it?

EDIT: Reiterating for clarity, I believe you'd have to do away with requiring 270 votes from this method.  The Revised Compact would be to throw all of the votes to whoever had the most proportional votes with this method. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

Back in 1929, the population of America was approximately 121 million, and so each House member represented about 278,000 constituents. But with rapid population growth, in 2020 the population of the USA is about 328 million; and now House members represent a much larger 754,000. 


Proponents for increasing the size of the House of Representatives will commonly suggest the ""[Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule)"" or the ""[Cube Root Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root_rule)"" as a method to determine the size of the chamber. Taking into consideration the assumption that the Reapportionment Act of 1929 would be adjusted or repealed, either of these rules would adjust the House to the levels seen in the information below (as of the 2010 census). 


Wyoming Rule - 547 Members - Approx. 600,000 Constituents per Member


Cube Root Rule - 676 Members - Approx. 485,000 Constituents per Member


But many believe the House is good as-is. Claiming that a higher amount of Representatives would become unwieldy and encumbering. That the high levels of bureaucracy would only increase with more members.

15,"Bernie Sanders, the Wyoming Caucus, his potential 8th win out of 9 contests since March 15 and the effects this will or won't have going forward to New York, Pennsylvania and beyond.",56.0,4e2f7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4e2f7t/bernie_sanders_the_wyoming_caucus_his_potential/,110.0,1460226953.0,"Wyoming has their [Democratic caucus](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-get-bernie-sanders-988-more-delegates/) today at 11am Mountain time (10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern), and while there been absolutely no polling, the outcome is in little doubt: Bernie Sanders is about to get his 8th win out of the 9 contests between Hillary Clinton's dominant March 15 performance and the New York primary on April 19.

Wyoming, being the least populous state and with minimal Democratic presence has a mere 14 pledged delegates up for grabs in total and only 8 of those delegates will be delegated today, with the remaining 6 apportioned at the end of May in Wyoming's Democratic state convention. So today is decidedly low stakes with the outcome in Wyoming doing little to move the needle in the ~215 pledged delegate gulf between the candidates.

As far as the outcome is concerned, Bernie Sanders should be expected to win the state with a strong double digit lead similar to his wins in nearly every other surrounding state (Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska). The big difference is that unlike Idaho(78/21) or Utah(77/20), which were open caucuses, Wyoming is a closed caucus similar to Nebraska(57/43) and Colorado(59/40) (and nearby Kansas(68/32)), meaning that only Democrats who registered by March 25 may vote, which strongly reduces the participation rate of independent and last minute voters.
 
So while it would be farfetched to say that Wyoming favors Clinton, it is perhaps _slightly_ more favorable than Idaho or Utah and is probably  somewhere between Kansas and Nebraska, and that's important for the delegate count (such as it is) because Sanders' ([revised and updated](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-get-bernie-sanders-988-more-delegates/)) delegate goal should be to get at least 6 of today's 8 delegates (11/14 delegates), and in order to do so he has to get roughly 68-69% of today's vote. So Clinton's goal is to keep Sanders at or below 67% to keep the delegates to a 5/3 split. (However, IF Hillary Clinton can muster a 1% better outcome than her finish in Nebraska and get a 56/44 loss, Wyoming's 8 delegates will split evenly 4/4, effectively eliminating Sander's chance to even slightly erode her delegate lead going into the next 2-1/2 weeks of Eastern seaboard closed primaries.)

So presuming Sanders fares about as well as expected today, has the last 3-1/2 weeks of Sanders wins done effectively nothing to move the contest in any appreciable way, or has Sanders, as some of his supporters seem to believe, showed significant ""momentum"" in this recent series of largely liberal and/or largely white primarily open caucus states that can translate into a strong close in the closed primaries of the much more diverse states of New York, Pennsylvania and, eventually, California that can net him, if not a pledged delegate lead, than a significant lead in raw vote total?

* Utah
* Mississippi
* Nevada

Besides Nevada, which went for President Obama twice, all of these states have been solidly red. The Democrats have 25 seats up for election and at least 4 of those are in serious danger of being won by Republican challengers - West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Missouri, which all voted Republican the last two Presidential elections. If the Democrats aren't able to pick up seats this election cycle, they'll need to flip 3 or 4 of these solidly red states in 2018 while maintaining all 25 of their own in order to get to a 51 vote majority. Reaching a filibuster-proof super-majority would be literally impossible. 


This just does not look like the kind of electoral environment in which a political revolution can take place. Sanders would be trying to pass programs like single payer and free college education with even fewer Congressional democrats to work with than Obama had, who was barely able to get Obamacare through by the skin of it's teeth. How is this going to be possible? What does Sanders do if he just plain doesn't have the votes for these things? ",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming
17,Does Gary Trauner (D) have a ghost of a chance in the Wyoming senate election?,49.0,9gyeou,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/9gyeou/does_gary_trauner_d_have_a_ghost_of_a_chance_in/,87.0,1537302156.0,"Gary Trauner is a democrat running for the United States Senate against incumbent John Barrasso in ruby red Wyoming. This is probably the least talked about senate election this cycle, which is understandable; Wyoming is a tiny state with uncontroversial politicians that is typically too partisan to be worth discussion. It doesn't draw the interest of larger, more heavily contested races like Texas and Florida. Also, it will never be a tipping point seat as if democrats take this seat it's very likely they won control of the senate hours before. However, in the senate spirit of all states having equal legislative power, I think it's only right to give even the most seemingly unexciting races their day in court.

Trauner is running on a mantra of ""Washington sucks because of corruption, extreme partisanship and money in politics, and I can help change this"" similarly to Joe Manchin of WV, the only state redder than WY at the moment. In a humorous youtube ad over folksy strumming hat gained a relative traction, [he highlights these points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7kg0jv4TxA) 

Can his persona and hammering down on relatively bipartisan populist issues that are popular with both sides potentially win over some moderate republicans?

Despite never having won a statewide election, Trauner came very close in a race for the House of Representatives seat for Wyoming at large in 2006. [losing in a plurality by getting .5% fewer votes, or roughly 1000 votes, less than his opponent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Wyoming,_2006) He ran again in 2008, losing by a more convincing 10%, but a lot of that could have to do with Obama's unpopularity in the state boosting republican turnout.

2018 is shaping up to be a similar political landscape to 2006 with an unpopular incumbent president and an even more motivated left wing. With no unpopular nationwide candidate to tie Trauner to, we may see a tighter race. Also, Trauner is well funded by both local and out of state donations. In a tiny state like Wyoming, this matters heavily.

Obviously, Trauner is a very much an underdog. John Barrasso is a very popular incumbent, at 61% approval rating from [an admittedly older poll taken in 2017,](https://morningconsult.com/2018/01/23/senator-rankings-jan-2018) and no significant poll or analysts has this race under anything but a safe republican seat. History shows this senate seat consistently performing at roughly 70

Even then, does Trauner have a realistic path to victory?  Can any democrat ever or should democrats consider Wyoming a lost cause? Even if it is, what are the chances of his candidacy potentially helping smaller democratic candidates win state senate seats or take away republican resources from more important races races?",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

As part of it, the narrator mentioned that votes in different states count more or less toward the presidential election because of the disparity between the number of people in a state and the number of Electoral College representatives (electors) they have. 

This got me thinking... how many Massachusetts votes is a Rhode Island vote worth? What about Vermont vs. Wyoming? So I did some Excel work and built a quick spreadsheet. It was mainly an exercise for myself, but I figured some of you might like it.

I've included a link to [my spreadsheet here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqX-rp0QKdfBdFJkWU41SlVvdFlLQUthUUpicnlIaXc) It seems pretty self explanatory to me, but if you need help reading it, let me know.

If anyone wants me to read how I did it, you can check out below.

I took the population of each state (from the 2010 census) and divided it by the number of electors they have. Once I had that, I found the average number of residents/elector (total US population/total electors). I took average/actual. Then I divided that number for each state in a row by each state in columns.

The first is to run a Never Trumper in the GOP primary like Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney or Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who while they would presumably fail to get the nomination would sufficiently tar Trump so that he'd lose the general election to Biden or someone other Democrat. This strategy is one anti-Trump folks like the Lincoln Project would favor.

An alternative choice would be to back a governor Ron DeSantis or maybe a Glenn Youngkin-type candidate who could defeat Trump in the primary itself and then go on to win the general election. The primary focus of the campaign would be a generational change message a la Bill Clinton in 1992 against president GHW Bush rather than a denounce Trump at every turn message of the Never Trump candidate.

Of course this is going to vary across the country (We're all going to get the same answer for Wyoming) but here are some factors/methods to think about.

* Should there be a blind algorithm that just looks at population densities/centers and divides that way

* How important are majority-minority districts?  If a minority makes up 15% of the US population, should it make up 15% of the house as well? 

* Socio-economic status?

31,What do you believe is the most likely outcome of a 2020 US Electoral College Tie?,22.0,eea7bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/eea7bi/what_do_you_believe_is_the_most_likely_outcome_of/,42.0,1577048257.0,"The US electoral college requires 270 votes to win.

As you likely know, it *is* possible that, even in a two-candidate race, neither candidate achieves that. 

You could argue that based on forecasts, it is actually more likely this year than in previous years (though still overall unlikely to happen). For example, if you take the 2016 Presidential map but switch democratic party to win PA and NE-2 or ME-2...Both parties would end up with 269 electoral votes (assuming no faithless electors).

In the case of an electoral college tie, the house of representatives votes to elect the president, choosing between the *three* candidates (likely really only two) who received the most electoral college votes. BUT it is not an individual vote, by congressperson. The votes are tallied by state - Each state gets ONE Vote. So even though California has 55 representatives in the house, their state counts as 1 vote, same as Wyoming or any other state. 

Thus, in the case of a tie, what it will really come down to will be how each state votes. Assuming votes are along party-lines, there are 19 ""Dem States"", 4 ""Lean Dem States"", 2 ""Lean GOP States"", 24 ""GOP States"", and 1 ""Tie State"". See my comment below for a list of each state and definition of those terms.

Assuming there are no further changes to the House of Representatives until the 2020 election, Democratics would have to somehow win the ""tie"" state (Pennsylvania, which has 10 Republican and 10 Democrat representatives), and also sway at-least one congressperson from one of the 2 lean GOP States (Florida and Wisconsin). In that case, they'd have a tie...

In the case that the house of representatives is unable to decide, the Vice-President Elect assumes the presidency in interim. In the case of an electoral college tie, the vice president would be determined by a popular vote in the senate, and thus is almost guaranteed to be Mike Pence. 

**If there were to be an electoral college tie, how do you think it would play out? Would the Democratic party be able to sway a US House congressperson from WI, PA, and/or FL to abstain voting for Donald Trump? Which congressperson do you think might be most susceptible to that?**",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

Here's how to fix it.

Option 1: Increase the number of Representatives—which has been [unchanged since 1913](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment#Reapportionment). You're welcome to go this route, but good luck. This would require federal action—and possibly even a Constitutional amendment if you want a long-term solution—so I wouldn't count on it happening anytime soon.

Option 2a: Petition your state to redraw the geographical district boundaries using a third-party, non-partisan group. Enlist your friends, family, and everyone you know to send your local representatives (from your State Legislature) a letter, phone call, and/or e-mail each week until the issue is resolved. Each and every week. Watch *The Shawshank Redemption* for inspiration. It's not going to happen overnight, but you've got two years before the mid-term elections in 2014. Start now. And if not by then, you'll have two more years before the next election.

Option 2b: Petition your state to redraw the district boundaries using something other than geography. Start a dialogue about alternatives. Maybe have your representation based on party, so if some third party can garner enough votes even they get someone in congress. Maybe do it by last name to provide a more random sampling of the state. Or district by age or income or education level or something else. A letter, phone call, and/or e-mail to your local State representatives each week.

Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Delaware are off the hook since they only have one Representative. But the rest of us need to get to work doing something about it.

Massachusetts - Trump will win

Minnesota - Poll from last month had Rubio ahead

Oklahoma - What polls there are show this could be close

Texas - People will mostly be looking at how Cruz does here. If he can't win his home state, his campaign is over (or should be)

Vermont - Trump will win

Virginia - Rubio could win, and IMO needs to

Wyoming - No polls


It seems to be Rubio needs a win in Virginia and one other state at bare minimum, and probably Georgia and a 4th state as well. Given there's only 6 states that have any evidence of being winnable, that's a pretty slim margin. What do you think he needs? 

Also, does he want Ted Cruz doing badly in Texas, or well? It's hard for me to see Ted Cruz giving up early, so even with a loss in Texas he's still siphoning votes away from Rubio, but if he does well, he can help to keep Trump from getting delegates.",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

* Electoral College also makes a vote in Wyoming worth about four times more than a vote from California.

38,"A Legitimate Republican House Majority -
Not gerrymandering, it’s the federal system",13.0,181hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/181hoh/a_legitimate_republican_house_majority_not/,64.0,1360205450.0,"Republicans have recently been accused of gerrymandering because they obtained control of the House of Representatives although Democrats received more votes.  Republicans’ 58.2 million votes were fewer than the 59.6 million casted for Democratic representatives*.  But a comprehensive analysis of the votes in all states shows that Republicans would still have the House majority in a neutral districting system, that is, a system without gerrymandering.  However, the difference in seats between the parties would be much smaller, 219-216 instead of 234-201.

Gerrymandering is widespread, and both parties do it, although Republicans do it better.  If seats were assigned using proportional allocation, the results would be different in 34 states.  Gerrymandering won 38 seats for Republicans in 21 states and 23 for Democrats in 13 states.

But the real gerrymandering talent of Republicans is their ability to “gerrymander” seats in states where they did not receive a vote majority: North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New Jersey.  Democrats were able to did this only in Arizona to “steal” a single seat.  Using a sports metaphor, if we call the party with the most votes in a state the home team, Republicans are a better road team than Democrats.

The good news for our system of representation is that the House has a legitimate majority because the US is a federation of states.  Although Democrats received more overall votes, when seats are calculated with a neutral metric state by state, Republicans get the 219-216 majority.  This apparent contradiction can be explained due to at least two factors: Republicans had less “wasted” votes, and Democrats had a higher vote-cost per seat (more details below).

Gerrymandering must be addressed to avoid future unjust seat allocations, but Republicans in this administration can leave accusations of gerrymandering behind and focus on passing the laws that this country needs.  They represent the will of the people in the several states and their mission to improve this country is paramount.   
 
Now, the details about the gerrymandering analysis.  To understand the effects of gerrymandering an analysis of the nation as a whole must be done.  An objective reasonable metric for measuring gerrymandering is needed, but this has proven difficult to accomplish.  Mathematical models have been developed to measure the compactness, or some other geometric characteristic, of district maps, based on the principle that districts represent a group of people in the same area.  Thus, by having representatives from all areas, we have a representative government for the whole nation.

However, geographic models tend to be complex and may require subjective interpretation.  I believe that a proportional model can be used to obtain a rough metric of gerrymandering in the different states.  I am not claiming that proportional apportionment is better or worse than districting, only that it provides a baseline for measuring gerrymandering.  After all, proportional voting is in the DNA of this country.  In 1787, when the Framers met in Philadelphia to write the Constitution, the most debated issue was proportional voting versus equal suffrage in Congress, an issue that almost caused the convention to fail.  The final outcome was a compromise between the big states and the small states resulting in proportional voting in The House and equal representation in the Senate.

For the purpose of analyzing gerrymandering using a proportional model, the seats assigned to each party in a state are based on all  the votes received in the state.  Thus, if a state has 10 Congressional seats, Party A receives 60% of the votes, and Party B receives 40% of the votes, then Party A is assigned 6 seats and Party B is assigned 4 seats under the proportional model. This linear allocation of seats provides a reference number that can be compared to the actual number obtained by each party under the current districting scheme.  More details about the calculations are provided at the bottom for those interested in the math involved.

The benefit of the simplistic proportional model is that it ignores geometry, is color blind, and is reasonably fair because more seats are assigned to the party that receives more votes. If the proportional model were applied to the nation as a whole, the 58.2 and 59.6 million votes obtained by the Republican and Democratic parties would translate into 215 and 220 seats respectively, which would give a House majority to the Democrats.  But the US is a Federation of States and an analysis is needed state by state, not for the conglomerate of national votes.

After calculating the proportional seats for each state, a comparison is made to the actual number of seats obtained by each party, and the comparison is used to obtain a first categorization for the states: neutral states where the proportional and actual seats are the same, Republican-gain states where Republicans received more actual seats than proportional seats, and Democrat-gain states.  

For the states with seat gains, a second categorization is made based on whether the party that gained seats was the party that obtained the most votes in the state. Going back to the sports metaphor, when the “home” party gained votes then the party used its home-court advantage, or in other words, the party swept home some seats, which are referred to as “home seats.” On the other hand, when the “visitor” party gained seats then the party stole the home court advantage, or the party stole some of those home seats, which are called “visitor seats.”   

It is noted that when a party gains one seat, it is implicit that the other party losses one, and the effect on the difference of seats in the House is two.  Further, a seat-gain percentage is also calculated as the “stealing” of one seat in a state with a few number of Representatives (e.g., Idaho) would be statistically more telling than in a state with a large number of Representatives (e.g., California).

Below are the results by category, sorted by seat-gain percentage.  For each state, two parameters are provided in parenthesis: the seats gained when comparing actual to proportional seats (if any), and the seat-gain percentage (if any).

NEUTRAL STATES: Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 

GOP SWEEPING HOME SEATS: Idaho (1 gained seat, 50% seat-gain percentage), Oklahoma (2, 40), Nebraska (1, 33), Alabama (2, 29), South Carolina (2, 29), Ohio (4, 25), Arkansas (1, 25), Kansas (1, 25), Indiana (2, 22), Virginia (2, 18), Kentucky (1, 17), Missouri (1, 13), Florida (3, 11), Tennessee (1, 11), Georgia (1, 7), and Texas (2, 6).

DEMOCRATS SWEEPING HOME SEATS: Hawaii (1, 50), Maine (1, 50), Rhode Island (1, 50), New Hampshire (1, 50), Connecticut (2, 40), Marilyn (2, 25), Massachusetts (2, 22), Oregon (1, 20), New York (3, 11), Illinois (2, 11), Washington (1, 10), and California (5, 9).

GOP STEALING VISITOR SEATS: North Carolina (3, 23), Pennsylvania (4, 22), Michigan (2, 14), Wisconsin (1, 13), and New Jersey (1, 8).

DEMOCRATS STEALING VISITOR SEATS: Arizona (1, 11).

Republicans swept 27 home seats while Democrats swept 22 home seats, a difference of 5 in favor of Republicans in the home court.  Republicans stole 11 visitor seats while Democrats stole just 1 visitor seat, a difference of 10 in favor of Republicans.  The conclusion is that both parties can be blamed for some gerrymandering, although Republicans are better at it, mainly because Republicans play much better on the road, 11 stolen visitor seats vs. the 1 stolen visitor seat by Democrats.

Another interesting statistic is the total number of proportional seats by party. Adding all the state proportional seats results in 219 proportional Republican seats and 216 proportional Democratic seats, a Republican majority, which was unexpected because Democrats obtained more votes overall.  One explanation for this unexpected result is that Democrats had more “wasted” votes than Republicans, a “wasted” vote being a vote that didn’t contribute to obtain a seat.  Another factor explaining the unexpected result is that Republicans needed about 5,700 votes less for each proportional seat than Democrats, which means that districts with more voters (people that actually voted, not that were eligible to vote) were more likely to go to Democrats.

The conclusion is that Republicans would still have the House majority in a system without gerrymandering, although the gap with Democrats would be much smaller.  Republicans have a House majority because the US is a Federation of States.

Regarding which is the state that “gerrymandered” the most, I believe that the winner is the state that stole the biggest percentage of visitor seats.  Sweeping home seats is somewhat more understandable in a Democratic system, as each state may want to bring to the Federal Government the influence from the majority of voters in the state.  After all, the election of President follows the principle of winner takes all, which is just an extreme case of the sweeping home principle.  By the way, if we apply the winner-takes-all approach to the House of Representatives, Democrats would get a House majority with 225 seats vs. 210 for Republicans, which makes sense since Obama was elected President under the winner-takes-all system and most people vote within party for President and Representative.

Looking at the visitor seats stolen, two states are declared winners for gerrymandering, as the difference between them is statistically insignificant to break the tie.  The winners are Pennsylvania (4 stolen visitor seats) and North Carolina (3), each having a visitor seat-gain percentage of about 23%.

METHODOLOGY FOR GERRYMANDERING CALCULATION
A spreadsheet with the calculations is available from
https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=1f3b347f538f686c&page=view&resid=1F3B347F538F686C!588&parid=1F3B347F538F686C!105&authkey=!An2JbVLobIIm8i0&Bpub=SDX.SkyDrive&Bsrc=Share 

* I started with a spreadsheet with the results from election night. Thanks to The Guardian for making the spreadsheet available for download as it saved me data-entry time.  The numbers were updated in January with certified results from the Secretary of State or the Election Commission of the respective states. Votes for other parties where discarded for this analysis.  Note that in Louisiana some districts have multiple Republican candidates and all their votes were counted for the analysis. 

A pivot table was created to summarize the results by state.  Next, the total number of votes in each state was calculated for the Republican and Democratic parties (again, ignoring other parties).  The votes per seat was calculated as the total number of votes divided by the number of seats for each state. An initial allocation of seats was given to each party next, by calculating how many seats a party could “buy,” that is, how many times the votes for a party included the votes per seat number.  After using the votes to buy into the initial allocation of seats, a remainder was calculated on how many votes were left for each party.  The party with the biggest remainder was assigned the final seat for each state, and the other party added the remainder to the “waste” votes column.  The result was the tally of proportional votes for both parties in all states.

The vote “gain” by each party was then calculated as the difference between actual seats obtained and the proportional seats. Finally, the gain was assigned as “home” or “visitor” gain depending on which party received the most votes in the state.  The seat-gain percentage was calculated as the gain over the number of seats for the state.

The argument is that ""someone in Wyoming has more power in the Senate than someone in California"" but making that argument completely ignores the role of the Senate.

If I remember correctly, when drafting the constitution, there was a fear of states with large populations overpowering states with small populations. In order to counter this, the Senate was created. In this congressional body every single state would 2 Senators, no matter how many people lived in the state.

The fear was was then that small states could bully big states, or have ""too much of a say"" so to speak (why does a state of 10 people get to tell me what to do? 1,000 people live in my state). In order to counter this, the House of Representatives was created. In this congressional body, states would be assigned representatives based on their population.

The Senate and House would have to come together in order to create and pass laws. This way, everybody gets an equal say, rather than states overpowering one another due to population.

If we changed apportionment in the senate (which is the argument I see) then it completely negates the original role and purpose of the Senate congressional body, and just turns the senate into a second House of Representatives.

&#x200B;

I do believe that House seats need to be redrawn. If anything, maybe set the Senate up with an odd number of delegates per state, but remain a fixed number. As well as make the Senate a popular vote, if it isn't already. If the Senate is done by districts, then have one district per delegate, where each district is based solely on population, and drawn randomly, with a goal to separate the districts so that each district has equal population and geographic area (not sure how well this would work out).

40,"People who support stricter gun control laws, how do you combat people who cite states with the toughest laws having the worst violence?",12.0,3ilwj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ilwj3/people_who_support_stricter_gun_control_laws_how/,251.0,1440689063.0,"If you do a quick google search of ""[states with most gun related deaths](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/death-by-gun-top-20-states-with-highest-rates/)"" you bring up article after article pinpointing places like Alaska, Wyoming, Arkansas as being the places with the highest totals. Comparing this data with a search for [""states with toughest gun control laws""](http://www.deseretnews.com/top/1428/0/10-states-with-the-strictest-gun-laws.html) and you are led to believe that the places with stricter gun laws are safer.

If one were to just base their consensus on guns off of that data, they would be led to believe that having stricter gun control laws makes a state safer. This narrative might sound plausible by the statistics presented thus far, but something happens when you look up [""most violent cities'](http://kdvr.com/2015/05/08/by-the-numbers-here-are-the-most-dangerous-cities-in-america/). 

Amazingly enough the places with the stricter gun control laws are littered on the list of most violent cities. From California to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Mary Land etc. Interestingly enough the cities from the stricter gun control states are not on that list.

So what conclusion can we really make when the data seems to be contradictory? 

Are states with tougher gun control laws safer or are they more violent?

The answer is in the numbers. Densely populated places like NYC and Los Angeles are going to report gun deaths that are less because large swaths of those populations are not involved in gun related incidents. If say 10 people were using guns in those places and the place has 1000 residents then you are only going to have a 1% gun related death rate and would appear to be safe. However if you had only 5 people using guns in a place with 100 people your 5% gun rate is going to come off as being less safe.

Can you see how these numbers skew the actual results? 

Furthermore when you look at gun related deaths understand that those numbers incorporate suicide which do not have any adverse affect on the safety of a place. When looking at suicide by [gun statistics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/spr08gunprevalence/) ""The nine states that rank lowest in terms of gun prevalence are the very same nine that rank lowest for suicide rates. Similarly, the three states top-ranked for gun prevalence can be found among the four states ranking highest for suicide rates."" Hmm, isn't it interesting that the suicide data matches to the gun related data but is inversely correlated to the safety data?

I think it's easy to conclude that the gun statistics being presented as being worse in places where the gun laws are lax, are simply not true. At least when it is compared to violence. Which is really what the gun debate is all about.

If we truly wanted to get an answer to the question ""How do gun control laws affect the safety of states?"" we would have to remove the suicide statistics from the equation and look [murder rates](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/12/highest-murder-rate-us-cities-2013_n_6145404.html). 

Ironically the data there suggests that gun laws have no effect. Cities from the toughest gun control states are on the list alongside cities from states with lax gun control laws.

What all of this really means is that guns don't cause violence, people do. That gun laws don't stop violent crimes. One might conclude that eliminating guns might stop suicide at the hands of guns.. and that would probably be quite true. But then people will find more horrific ways of killing themselves (like what happens in countries like England) it won't stop suicide.

So the question really needs to be how do we stop violence from existing? We see that eliminating guns doesn't do this. What does?

That's 21 states away, with two already out the way. Most of the Southern states aren't favourable to him, but given his showing in New Hampshire, he should have a good shot at the other New England states before Michigan - Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine

At that point, if he hasn't won any states, he should probably pack it in (unless the field is still split up to Michigan). Maybe he's trying to raise funds there (he's out of cash), but it still seems like an odd choice.

Even back in 1787, the large states thought that this was bullshit. But it was a compromise and it passed. 

Since then, the political history of the US can be told as the story of gradually decreasing importance of states and state sovereignty, and gradually increasing federalism. The world in general has gotten much smaller in regards to our transportation, communication, media, and business. As society and technology have advanced, larger and more consolidated states make more sense than ever.

Yet, we still have the US Senate, where states with only one congressman have the same ability to block legislation as states with more than 100 times their population. It is by definition undemocratic, and recent events in politics have proven to me that the Senate is destroying our country. Its not just the filibuster. We could get rid of the filibuster completely and you might still need 60% or more of the US population to support legislation in order to get it passed because so many of the least populous states are affiliated with one political party.

We should get rid of the Senate, and our new unicameral legislature should optimally be elected with Proportional Representation. At the very least, each state's congressional delegation should be elected by PR within the state.

What is the real-world argument for preserving the Senate? I'm not talking about any arguments for tradition, and I'm not talking about any arguments that 'the small states would never go for it'. I'm talking about objective arguments about maximizing utility with respect to the nation as a whole. I don't care how much Wyoming would whine, I care that Wyoming would probably end up receiving much less in federal spending per capita, but that states like New York and California would likely have great increases in federal spending per capita.

As far as maximizing the social net benefit, this can only be a good thing because there are so few people in Wyoming and other small states that they spend it on bridges to nowhere and brand new airports to serve 1,000 person communities. Meanwhile, states where people actually live currently receive much lower federal spending per capita, and if that were to change those states could be spending that money on schools, hospitals, and infrastructure to serve actual people in actual places where people are trying to live.",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Marketplace Fairness Act (S. 336). I appreciate knowing your views on this issue.
 
On February 14, 2013, Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming introduced the Marketplace Fairness Act. This bill is designed to allow local Main Street retailers to compete more effectively against out-of-state merchants who sell over the internet.
 
Currently, retailers are only required to collect sales tax in states where they also have brick-and-mortar stores. The burden falls to consumers, who are required to report to state tax departments any sales taxes they owe for online purchases. As a result, local retailers are at a competitive disadvantage because they must collect sales taxes while out-of-state retailers, including many large online and catalog retailers, collect no state or local sales taxes. Consumers are left with the responsibility of reporting the sales taxes owed on online purchases on their tax returns. .
 
S. 336 would give states the option to collect sales tax already owed under current law from out-of-state businesses, rather than rely on consumers to report those taxes on their tax returns. The bill would not impose any new tax; rather, it would allow states to enforce the collection of sales tax already owed.
 
In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that out-of-state vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which the vendors do not have a typical brick and mortar presence. In an effort to stem the loss of tax revenue caused by internet sales, several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes. This effort is called the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA). S. 336 provides states the ability to enforce their existing laws upon becoming a member of the SSUTA or by adopting alternative minimum simplification requirements. States would have the clear authority to require all retailers to collect sales taxes and release consumers from tax remittance obligations. Contrary to some statements regarding the legislation, it will not increase the reporting burden on small businesses. Further, it would protect many truly small businesses from collection requirements by exempting those with annual gross remote sales under $1 million.
 
States, including Illinois, are grappling with a reduced tax base and growing needs as our nation recovers from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Our local businesses are struggling to complete against their remote counterparts. This bill provides states with much-needed revenue to keep providing essential services, as well as levels the playing field for businesses so they can all have a fair shot to succeed, create and retain jobs, and continue to contribute to local economies.
 
Thank you again for contacting me. I will keep your concerns about this bill in mind as this issue is discussed in the Senate. Please feel free to keep in touch.
 
Sincerely,

Would a national proportional vote instead for the senate do much better? You would vote for a party rather than a person and then based off of that, seats are doled out based on percentage of vote. This would solve a few problems:  

* Make the Senate a more democratic representation of the United States
* Introduce third parties and reduce spoiler votes and strategic voting
* Equalize the population disparity

Dear Mr. --------,
 
Thanks for your email expressing your support for Agreement among the States to Elect the President by National Popular Vote adoption.  I appreciate hearing from constituents on the important issues facing Minnesota.
 
I don't support the National Popular Vote movement for several reasons.
 
The founders of our country believed through a system of checks and balances that there should be a buffer between the people and the presidency. The Electoral College provides this buffer.  It allows small states to have some influence and not have the interests of large states outweigh them.  Presidents represent all the states and should care about the concerns of each one.  
 
Under a national popular vote, candidates would then only campaign in densely populated areas like New York City and Houston, TX and ignore places like Minnesota, Iowa and Wyoming just to name a few.  I know that many people were upset that Al Gore had 500,000 more votes than George W. Bush and still lost; however, to accept the popular vote concept, one has to support the notion of American citizens being allowed to elect their president directly, rather than it being the privilege of the states as the founders intended.  I prefer the current system.
 
You can be assured that this will be an ongoing discussion for years to come. 
 
Warmest regards,


Mike Jungbauer

63,Should America adopt to law to stop freeloading red states from sucking on the government's teat?,0.0,1j8slq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1j8slq/should_america_adopt_to_law_to_stop_freeloading/,3.0,1375056279.0,"Lately there has been in uptick in news coverage about the dire finances of cities like Oakland and Chicago, and states like California, Illinois and New Jersey, and the standard ignorant narrative goes something like, ""see what happens when democrats are in charge. This is the product of their tax and spend policies"".

It infuriates me because **it is so goddamn inaccurate**. California, Illinois, and New Jersey are all amongst the most economically and culturally thriving regions in america. They have tons of jobs and are home to many of the world's largest corporations, they are centers of transportation, commerce, culture, civil society, and more. And their finances would all be fine, or way more than fine, if they weren't subsidizing inbred moocher red states.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state

As you can see if you sort that list by net federal contribution per capita, blue states take the top 6 spots for sending more money into the federal government than they receive, and in general blue states dominate the more economically successful top half of the list while red states dominate to useless bloodsucker bottom half.

To take Illinois as an example, every year the federal government collects well over $100B in federal revenues from within Illinois, and every year Illinois only receives about 60% of that back in federal spending within the state. They suck $50B out of our economy **every year** and sprinkle it over trailer parks and meth labs in the red states, and then when Chicago is left starved of revenues, republicans have the nerve to go on Fox News and say, ""well what did you expect, thats Chicago Politics for you"".

Compare that to Mississipi where for every $1 of federal revenue collected, the federal government spends over $2.80 in the state. How about South Carolina, republican talking heads are always talking about how smart the pro-business anti-union policies of South Carolina are, how 'its not wonder manufacturing jobs are moving from the industrial midwest when their policies are so anti-business'. For every $1 in federal revenue collected in South Caroline, $1.80 is spent in the state. Yeah, I guess its easy to undercut the industrial midwest states when they're all net contributors to the federal budget and you're a worthless deadbeat sucking it dry. How about Wyoming, home of the Cheney's? People are always talking about how well managed that state is, how prosperous it is since the natural gas mining boom, how they are going to eliminate state taxes permanently by creating an endowment from mining tax revenues? I guess its easy to lower taxes and win the race to the bottom against more progressive states when you're getting $1.13 back from the federal government for every $1 you send.

Do you think that we need to end this unfairness through a new law, mandating that spending in the states must be approximately apportioned to their contributions to the federal government? 

A lot of red states would be left with crippling budget situations, but they're rugged individualists so I'm sure they'll be fine.

In the blue states, with all the revenue being generated by cities retained within their states, there would be a urban boom in America unlike we've seen since the 1920s. All the infrastructure improvements and city enhancements that places like NYC, Los Angeles, and Chicago have been dying for would instantly become possible. We could invest billions schools, public transport, and industrial infrastructure to attract more jobs. City finances would no longer be perpetually strained, they would suddenly be open to tons of new possibilities. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming

Example of how to read this table: The row labeled ""Minnesota"" is looking at all states as or less populous than Minnesota. So, 76,301,920 people live in one of the states in or above that row. This constitutes 24.13% of the U.S. population. Summing 50% plus 1 of each of the state populations in each state as or less populous than Minnesota means that 12.06% of the U.S. population would have needed to vote for whatever candidate won the senate elections in all of those states. In other words, this is the minimum proportion of the U.S. population that must have voted for the 60 senators representing those 30 states.

Just in case anybody still thought the U.S. was a democracy.

Edit: I made a [graph](https://imgur.com/1nFJF8U)

Edit2: I am aware that this is by design. That doesn't make it any more democratic. [Even the Supreme Court agrees](https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/372/372.US.368.112.html) that the electoral college is a historically specific compromise that is at odds with the principles of representative government (in a decision striking down a similar system Georgia was using for districting):

>We think the analogies to the electoral college, to districting and redistricting, and to other phases of the problems of representation in state or federal legislatures or conventions10 are inapposite. The inclusion of the electoral college in the Constitution, as the result of specific historical concerns,11 validated the collegiate principle despite its inherent numerical inequality, but implied nothing about the use of an analogous system by a State in a statewide election. No such specific accommodation of the latter was ever undertaken, and therefore no validation of its numerical inequality ensued. [citations omitted] Georgia gives every qualified voter one vote in a statewide election; but in counting those votes she employs the county unit system which in end result weights the rural vote more heavily than the urban vote and weights some small rural counties heavier than other larger rural counties. [...] **The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing—one person, one vote**

Edit3: Yes, I'm aware the point of the Senate is supposed to be to check against a tyranny of the majority. The problem is (1) It's possible to go too far in the other direction, and (2) there are a lot of tyrannies of the majority in Congress that at completely unchecked (ethnic majority, religious majority, two party majority, upper half of incomes majority...). If we're going to give a huge amount of disproportionate representation to a group that would be disenfranchised in purely majoritarian politics, why only focus on geography and not on any other factor? I'm not sure what the best alternative system would look like, but I am claiming the current system is bad enough that we should be talking about alternatives.",politics,Wyoming

2017 brought a number of elections, both regularly scheduled and special, but as we start off 2018, the midterm elections in President Trump's first term are likely to bring even more electoral news. While the election won't be until November 6th, the major parties will both hold nominating contests for various elected positions both federal and state throughout the year. Below, we've compiled a table of when those primary elections will be held, as well as voter registration deadlines. If there's anything inaccurate or omitted, please feel free to contact us to update. We will try to incorporate these deadlines in some of our regularly scheduled discussion threads throughout this year as an additional reminder to users.

Hopefully registering to vote if you haven't done so was on your list of New Years' resolutions!

We’re less than a month away from the official beginning of the 2020 Primaries and Caucuses! 50 states, 5 territories, the District of Colombia, and voters living abroad will be participating in caucuses and elections between early February and early June as part of the lead up to November in order to determine which candidate will represent the Republican and Democratic parties.


Democratic contests will be held in all 56 locations (as well as abroad), but Republican contests have been cancelled in  Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, Nevada, South Carolina, and Virginia.

Registration deadlines, voting/caucus procedures and dates vary from place to place, so we have put together this table to help you find out more information about how, where, and when you can participate. Follow the links for location-specific details and note the information regarding party-switching deadlines and caucus types at the bottom of the table.

On January 6th of this year, the United States Capitol Building was overrun by a mob of supporters of then-President Trump seeking to interfere with Congress’ certification of President Biden’s win in the 2020 election.

In response to this, and with an eye on preventing a recurrence, the House of Representatives has formed a bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the events of January 6th. 

This panel was designed by House Democratic leadership after the Senate Republicans defeated a bill to form a ‘9/11-stye’ bipartisan commission with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. 

The negotiations between the House Democratic majority and the Republican minority to form today’s alternative committee were contentious.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of five nominations from GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  After McCarthy responded by withdrawing all of his nominations, Pelosi invited GOP Representatives Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming to sit on the panel.  They were the only two Republicans to vote with the Democrats in favor of the creation of the Select Committee.  In total, 222 Representatives voted in favor and 190 against.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time with opening statements from Representative Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY).  Today the committee will also hear testimony from four of the Capitol police officers who were on-duty during the attack.  Shortly before the hearing, Minority Leader McCarthy will hold a brief presser.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all evening) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

Polls will open on the East Coast as early as 6am EST and the final polls will close in Alaska at 9pm AKST (1am EST). Depending on how close certain elections are, this could make for a very late evening. Note: This is specifically for state polls. US territories have different poll times.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all day) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

Fred Keller (R) are running in a special election to fill the vacant seat representing Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House. The election will be held May 21, 2019.

The vacancy occurred following the resignation of former Rep. Tom Marino (R) on January 23, 2019. He beat Friedenberg by 32 points in November 2018. Donald Trump (R) won the district by 36 points in the 2016 presidential election.

This district is expected to be held by republicans. G. Terry Madonna, a pollster in Pennsylvania, said that ""barring something that emerges to damage the Republican candidate, a Republican victory is virtually assured.""

Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District is located in central and northern Pennsylvania and includes portions of Bradford, Centre, Clinton, Juniata, Lycoming, Mifflin, Northumberland, Perry, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, Union, and Wyoming counties.

Rather than hold a primary, party committees nominated their candidates for the race. Keller was selected at his party's convention from a field of 14 candidates, receiving the nomination after four rounds of voting. Friedenberg was the only Democratic candidate to declare his candidacy, and he received his party's nomination by default.

Wyoming's primary election concludes Aug. 21 as voters decide who will advance to the November general election.

The highest-profile contest is the governor's race, where six Republican candidates are seeking the nomination.

Only one, Wyoming Treasurer Mark Gordon, is a currently in public office. The race also features three businessmen, Foster Friess, Sam Galeotos and Bill Dahlin, and attorney, Harriet Hageman, and a physician, Taylor Haynes. 

Two Democrats, Kenneth R. Casner and Mary A. Throne, are vying for their party's nomination for governor.

Incumbent Gov.Matt Mead, a Republican, has served two terms and is term-limited.

Of the past 10 governors in Wyoming, five have been Democrats, and five have been Republicans.

At the federal level, Congresswoman Liz Cheney is facing challenges from two other Republicans, Blake E. Stanley and Rod Miller. Two Democrats, Greg Hunter and Travis Helm, are seeking their party's nod.

U.S. Sen. John Barrasso is favored against five challengers in his bid for re-election. The victor advances to face Democrat Gary Trauner in the fall.

*Polling places in Wyoming are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Election Day. Absentee ballots must be received by the county clerk no later than 7 p.m. on Election Day, delivered either by mail or in person.

##**Alaska**

Alaska is headed toward an unusually competitive primary in just over three weeks. And that competition is mostly within the Republican Party.

The 2018 Alaska gubernatorial election will take place on November 6, 2018, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. Incumbent Governor Bill Walker is running for re-election to a second term again as an Independent candidate. 

At the top of the ticket, both of the competitive primaries for governor and lieutenant governor are in the Republican Party. There are seven Republican candidates to be governor and six from the party running to be lieutenant governor.

Most of the attention right now is focused on the leading candidates for governor: former Wasilla Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell of Anchorage. Dunleavy has built up a lead, according to polls. Treadwell is trying to make up ground, arguing that he’s better qualified.

Candidates from the Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska Libertarian Party and Alaskan Independence Party appear on the same ballot, with the highest-placed candidate from each party receiving that party's nomination. In the primaries for recognized political parties, candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor run separately. 

The winners of each respective primary for Governor and Lieutenant Governor then become a joint ticket in the general election for their political party. In October 2017 the AKDP sued for the right to allow non-Democrats to compete for and win the Democratic nomination, which was ultimately decided in their favor in April 2018. This move was widely thought to benefit incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, to foreclose the possibility of a Democratic nominee splitting the vote with Walker against a Republican nominee. However with the entry of former Senator Mark Begich into the race, Walker withdrew from the Democratic primary and forged ahead with a fully independent bid for reelection.

In the House, there are 109 primary candidates running, the most since 1996. Twenty-four of the 29 competitive primaries in the Senate and the House are on the Republican side.

This election is for all Alaskans who are registered to vote to decide which candidates will be on the ballot in November’s general election for the offices of U.S. Representative, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, State Senate and State House.

*This election is in person at your local polling place, even for Anchorage residents. (Go to https://myvoterinformation.alaska.gov/ to look up your polling place). Polling places are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. You can also vote early or absentee.*

*The deadline to update your voter registration for the Primary election is July 22.*

*There are two ballot selections (you may only vote one):
Democratic, Libertarian, Alaska Independence party candidates will be on one ballot that any registered voter can vote, regardless of registered party. Republican party candidates will be on a ballot that Republican, Undeclared and Nonpartisan registered voters can select.*

It is time to get registered and make sure that your voice is heard this November. 

There isn't much time left to register, so no excuses, get it done today. **Mid-October** is the end of the voter registration period in most states. 

&nbsp;

Feeling a bit unsure about what to do? Well you are in luck, we have a nifty little ""How To"" below or you can skip all that and just go to:

&nbsp;

**[NationalVoterRegistrationDay.org](http://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/register-to-vote/?source=reddit)**

or


**[RockTheVote.org](http://www.rockthevote.org/)**

or 

**[Vote Plz](https://www.voteplz.org/)**

 to quickly register online.

&nbsp;

##Have Questions?

We're here to help.  We will be here throughout the day today to help you find answers about registration and voting, and we are joined by /u/VoterRegistrationDay!

____

&nbsp;

##Step by Step:

&nbsp;

**STEP 1: Check to see if you're eligible to vote**

From Register to Vote, via. USA.gov:

""To be eligible to vote, you must be a U.S. citizen. In most states, you must be 18 years old to vote, but some states do allow 17 year olds to vote. States also have their own residency requirements to vote. For additional information about state-specific requirements and voter eligibility, [contact your state election office](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/contact_your_state.aspx).""

&nbsp;

**STEP 2: Check your current registration status**

[Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/) will link you to your state's specific registration information, including for most states an online database to check if you are currently registered at your present address.

&nbsp; 


**STEP 3: Register to vote**

 * [Register to Vote | USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml)  Official US Government portal for voter registration.
 * [Mail-in voter registration forms](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx)  Citizens of North Dakota, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, New Hampshire and the U.S. Virgin Islands are ineligible for mail-in registration and will will have to hit up their [state election office](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/contact_your_state.aspx) for more information

&nbsp;

**STEP 4: Check if you need additional ID to vote**

*Please check this information carefully as your state's requirements may have changed since the last time you voted.*

Your vote may be relegated to the rank of a provisional ballot if you don't have the required photo ID for your state, you may not be allowed to vote at all.  

 * [National conference of state Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#State_Reqs) list of state by state voter ID requirements.
 * [Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/) Check the ""Know what ID to bring"" section and type in your zip code.
 * Do a Google search for ""Voter Identification [state]"" in which [state] is your state or territory.

How and where to acquire a valid ID to vote: 
 
 * [DMV Identification Card](http://www.dmv.org/id-cards.php) By far the easiest way to get a valid photo ID is going to be to go to your local DMV and purchase one.  (If you haven't gone before you should know that the horror stories aren't true, the DMV is just boring.)
 * Other acceptable forms of ID vary WILDLY by state.  Refer back to the [NCSL List](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) for more information.

&nbsp;

**STEP 5: Find your polling place**

 * Easiest method: Check your voter ID card.  Usually it will be printed clearly on the card.
 * Second easiest method: Google search ""Polling place [zip code]"" in which [zip code] is your zip code.
 * [Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/#) Expand ""Find your polling place,"" select your state and follow through on your state's website.
 * [Rock the Vote - Election Center](http://www.rockthevote.com/election-center/) Again, select your state and find the nearest polling place.


**Voting from your couch**

 * [Absentee and Early voting via. The National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx) If you cannot get to a polling place for whatever reason you still have options!  Many states have mail in ballots for early or absentee voting.  Hit up the link for a comprehensive list.


**Additional advice**

 * Ask for the day off from work.  For whatever reason Election Day is *not* a national holiday, you need to plan in advance!
 * Spread the word around.  Many people are completely oblivious to electoral cycles, you can and should inform them.
 * Voting is fast, easy and reasonable fun.  You have no excuse not to vote. 

&nbsp;

##Schedule

Polls opened today on the East Coast as early as 6am EST and the final polls will close in Alaska at 9pm AKST (1am EST). Depending on how close certain elections are, this could make for a very late evening. Note: This is specifically for state polls. US territories have different poll times.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all day) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

81,Discussion Thread: The 2022 midterm elections are almost upon us. Be sure you're registered to vote and consider becoming a poll worker. Resources in post.,753.0,xz280n,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/xz280n/discussion_thread_the_2022_midterm_elections_are/,79.0,1665259583.0,"Voting is an indispensible part of any functioning democracy.  We won't sell you too hard on the importance of voting, if you're in r/politics you probably don't need to hear much about that.  You might consider taking the additional step of becoming a poll worker.

Poll workers go by different names in different localities.  Regardless of whether their responsibilities are carried out by ""election officers"", ""election judges"", or, as in Vermont, ""Justices of the Peace"", they serve a vital role in the conduction of free and fair elections in the United States.  If you are not otherwise busy on Election Day this November 8th, we highly encourage you to consider applying to be a poll worker.

Below you can find each US state, territory, or district's voter registration pages and, if available, a page to sign up to be a poll worker.

##Schedule

Polls opened today on the East Coast as early as 6am EST and the final polls will close in Alaska at 9pm AKST (1am EST). Depending on how close certain elections are, this could make for a very late evening. Note: This is specifically for state polls. US territories have different poll times.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all day) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

Now They're Being Sued For It. - A controversial Wyoming law is under legal fire after a broad coalition of environmental, justice, and animal rights groups filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday.",706.0,3n5u8q,http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/10/01/3707798/wyoming-data-trespass-lawsuit/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds,21.0,1443740327.0,,politics,Wyoming
86,Rhode Island Primary Election,709.0,9f8qe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9f8qe0/rhode_island_primary_election/,186.0,1536765996.0,"Elections are fast approaching as Rhode Island will hold its state primary elections today. A lot of attention is going to be focused on the governor's race as Democratic incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo, whose approval ratings as of July 2018 sit at 44 percent, faces a challenge from the left before competing against the GOP in the general election.

For the primary, Raimondo is up against former Rhode Island Secretary of State Matt Brown, who is running a progressive challenge. Meanwhile, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, former State Sen. Giovanni Feroce and State Representative Patricia Morgan will face off on the Republican side.

Senate District 30 bears watching as the state's Democratic Party endorsed Mark McKenney over incumbent State Sen. Jeanine Calkin. The winner will run unopposed in the general election as no Republican candidate qualified for the ballot.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse won his 2012 re-election bid with a 30-point margin after running unopposed in the Democratic primary. This year, Whitehouse faces Hopkinton native Patricia Fontes.

On the Republican side two candidates are on the ballot, Roque De La Fuente and Robert Flanders Jr., who previously served as an associate justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

This isn't De La Fuente's first time running for U.S. Senate. He has run in California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming, and is running in six states this election cycle. De La Fuente's eligibility was put into question because he's a California resident, but the Rhode Island Board of Elections said he may run.

The First Congressional District sees incumbent four-term U.S. Rep. David Cicilline squaring off against Christopher Young. Young had previously run for U.S. Senate, Congress and mayor of Providence. On the Republican side, Patrick Donovan faces Frederick Wysocki.

Additionally, there are three questions on the ballot this year, all of which ask if voters will approve additional state spending. Those will not be voted on until November.

A bond issue allowing additional spending for school buildings is Question 1 for Rhode Island voters. The request is for $250 million in funds over five years with the caveat that no more than $100 million may be issued in a year. If approved, the authorized funds would go towards school housing aid and the School Building Authority Capital Fund.

Question 2, the Rhode Island Higher Education Facilities Bond Measure, asks voters to approve $70 million in additional spending for new facilities at two Rhode Island colleges. The bond would be divided as follows:

 * $45 million to the University of Rhode Island Narragansett Bay Campus

 * $25 million to the Rhode Island College School of Education and Human Development

Question 3, the Rhode Island Environment, Recreation, and Water Infrastructure Bond Measure asks voters to approve $47.3 million of funding for various environmental, water and recreational projects.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all evening) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

I am the nominee for three socialist parties: I will be on the ballot in California for the Peace and Freedom Party, in Vermont for the Liberty Union Party, and on the ballot in Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Washington state for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

UPDATE: Hey everyone, I have to sign off now. Unlike the millionaire and billionaire candidates, I'm a worker and have to go to my job now. I'll try to sign back on later to answer some more questions. Thanks!

Update #2: Hi friends, I am at work and on very brief break but I wanted to add this.
There are many issues we have not talked about today, no questions for example, about the great resistance struggle at Standing Rock, which I consider to be of critical importance for all people to support. They are standing strong for Native sovereignty, against the extraction industry, against environmental destruction and for the planet and humanity. Or the crisis of police brutality and murders, of mass incarceration and unjust imprisonment. I call for immediate freedom as well for Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Mutulu Shakur, Chelsea Manning, Russell Maroon Shoatz, Oscar López Rivera, Ana Belén Montes, and many other political prisoners, for the right of all prisoners to have real, full healthcare, like the treatment for Hepatitis C that is denied to inmates. I call for the immediate shut-down of Guantánamo, the release of those inmates so cruelly tortured for years, and returning the territory back to Cuba, for the end of the US blockade of Cuba, the end of the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, the end of all sanctions against other countries, the ending of all aid to Israel, and self-determination for the Palestinian people, including the right of return. So much to talk about and fight for. Thanks!",politics,Wyoming

98,Discussion Thread: 2022 Wyoming and Alaska Midterms Primaries,583.0,wpzy79,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wpzy79/discussion_thread_2022_wyoming_and_alaska/,1525.0,1660670250.0,"Two leading Republican critics of Trump face serious primary challenges today as voters head to the polls for state wide nominating contests in Wyoming and Alaska. Polls are open from 7am to 7pm local time in Wyoming, and 7am to 8pm in Alaska.

**Notable Races:**

 * All eyes today are on the GOP primary for Wyoming's at-large district, where incumbent Rep. Liz Cheney is fighting a primary challenge from Trump endorsed state legislator Harriet Hageman. Cheney became persona non grata from Trump world after forcefully condemning the Jan 6 insurrection, voting to impeach the former president, and taking a leading role against Trump's Big Lie as vice chair of the House Jan 6 Committee. Nonetheless, despite calls for Wyoming Democrats to switch registrations and support Cheney, polls suggest Hageman is running well ahead of the one-time third ranking House Republican.
 * The other pro-election Republican, Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski, faces a slate of as many as 18 primary opponents, lead by Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka. Fortunately for Murkowski, this year Alaska switched to a jungle primary system where the top four candidates, regardless of party affiliation, will advance. Murkowski is expected to make the cut.
 * Meanwhile, also in Alaska, former Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin is attempting to stage a political comeback, by running in the special election to fill the state's at large House seat. This position was vacated by Rep. Don Young's death earlier in March. She is competing against former state house rep. Democrat Mary Sattler Peltola, and fellow Republican Nick Begich III, a scion of an Alaskan political dynasty. Independent Al Gross, who also advanced from the primary, withdrew and endorsed Peltola.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all evening) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all evening) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

##Schedule

Polls will open on the East Coast as early as 6am EST and the final polls will close in Alaska at 9pm AKST (1am EST). Depending on how close certain elections are, this could make for a very late evening. Note: This is specifically for state polls. US territories have different poll times.

#Megathread Topic

The point of this megathread (that will be stickied all day) is to serve as the hub for both general Election Day and US Presidential discussion. More targeted discussion will occur in each state’s associated thread. These threads will serve for discussion of all local and state specific elections. This will ideally help make the discussion much more accessible for all those interested in these races.

148,"If you haven't seen the movie ""Gasland"" - here are the facts the gas companies don't want you to be terrified by.",276.0,fo82m,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fo82m/if_you_havent_seen_the_movie_gasland_here_are_the/,206.0,1298074125.0,"If you haven't seen Gasland - here are the facts the gas companies don't want you to be terrified by.

In 2004 Cheney and Bush  exempted all the ""Gas Fracturing"" extraction companies from the clean water act and the superfund cleanup act and simultaneously leased them a huge percentage of all the BLM Public land in the country.

Now they have built thousands of fracture wells injecting extremely harmful cancer causing chemicals into the ground and ground water  in all those public lands to break up the earth so the natural gas would be able to flow back to the well head and be extracted.

The effect has been -unsurprisingly- huge seepages of all those injected chemicals - which by the way NEVER will break down - all the way back up into ground water, wells and even surface streams where literally you see film of many many people lighting their faucet water on fire and streams bubbling up with the gases that also can be lit on fire. (the effect in the movie is hard to exaggerate - literally people's faucet water exploding in their sinks on camera in multiple states.

These are also causing pollution fog clouds in these otherwise nearly pristine areas so the air quality in some of this public land is now worse than in Los Angeles.

Some of the people who have breathed those ground hugging clouds are in the hospital and suffered permanent whole body systemic breakdowns.

There have been animal kills as well.

This is across multiple states in the southwest and Wyoming - huge areas of land. HUGE.

Some homeowners in these states have been supplied with reverse osmosis water filters for the wells which the underground injected chemicals simply eat through the membranes of. Others have had water trucked in.

The area of pristine land from northern Pennsylvania and further that supplies all the fresh water to New York city and Philadelphia has also been leased to these same people but as of now they have not built any fracture wells ... yet (as of the movie filming in 2010 - they are probably RACING to do it now so If I lived in NYC I 'd be screaming for an injunction and stop fast).

You can't possibly truck in enough water to replace that water supply to New York city and Philadelphia. There isn't enough fresh water anywhere to do it.

There is no known way to get those chemicals that have been injected into the ground in all those states back out of the ground or stop them from moving around under ground since they have fractured all the barrier rocks layers underground to get to the natural gas.

The areas of poisoned land just since 2004 is so immense it is staggering and because most of it was BLM land given by Bush it used to all be the cleanest area in the country and is now the most polluted and poisonous. 

THAT is why the gas companies are so desperate for you not to see this movie.

The damage is so immense and the damaging intent and fore knowledge of the damage it was going to cause was so clear (that's why they were exempted from the clean water act and the superfund act) that is defies belief that Cheney and Bush and corporate leaders shouldn't be brought up on charges of intentional terrorism and poisoning of essential national water supplies. Honestly if a person had poisoned one one hundredth of the water supply Cheney and Bush intentionally and with fore knowledge PERMANENTLY poisoned that person would be tried and put to death as a terrorist like in Oklahoma City or Guantanemo.

It staggers belief and the damage and scale is even worse than the gulf Oil spill which is hard to imagine.

And that is why they don't want you to see that film GasLand.

Edit: a fellow redditor provided me this link to watch the movie online

There isn't much time left to register, so no excuses, get it done today. **OCTOBER 1, 2014** is the last day to register in many states. 

&nbsp;

Feeling a bit unsure about what to do? Well you are in luck, we have a nifty little ""How To"" below or you can skip all that and just go to:

&nbsp;

**[Rockthevote.org](http://www.rockthevote.org/)** to quickly register online.

&nbsp;

____
____

&nbsp;

###Step by Step:

&nbsp;

**STEP 1: Check to see if you're eligible to vote**

From Register to Vote, via. USA.gov:

""To be eligible to vote, you must be a U.S. citizen. In most states, you must be 18 years old to vote, but some states do allow 17 year olds to vote. States also have their own residency requirements to vote. For additional information about state-specific requirements and voter eligibility, [contact your state election office](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/contact_your_state.aspx).""

&nbsp;

**STEP 2: Check your current registration status**

[Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/) will link you to your state's specific registration information, including for most states an online database to check if you are currently registered at your present address.

&nbsp; 


**STEP 3: Register to vote**

 * [Register to Vote | USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml)  Official US Government portal for voter registration.
 * [Mail-in voter registration forms](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx)  Citizens of North Dakota, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, New Hampshire and the U.S. Virgin Islands are ineligible for mail-in registration and will will have to hit up their [state election office](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/contact_your_state.aspx) for more information

&nbsp;

**STEP 4: Check if you need additional ID to vote**

*Please check this information carefully as your state's requirements may have changed since the last time you voted.*

Your vote may be relegated to the rank of a provisional ballot if you don't have the required photo ID for your state, you may not be allowed to vote at all.  

 * [National conference of state Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#State_Reqs) list of state by state voter ID requirements.
 * [Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/) Check the ""Know what ID to bring"" section and type in your zip code.
 * Do a Google search for ""Voter Identification [state]"" in which [state] is your state or territory.

How and where to acquire a valid ID to vote: 
 
 * [DMV Identification Card](http://www.dmv.org/id-cards.php) By far the easiest way to get a valid photo ID is going to be to go to your local DMV and purchase one.  (If you haven't gone before you should know that the horror stories aren't true, the DMV is just boring.)
 * Other acceptable forms of ID vary WILDLY by state.  Refer back to the [NCSL List](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) for more information.

&nbsp;

**STEP 5: Find your polling place**

 * Easiest method: Check your voter ID card.  Usually it will be printed clearly on the card.
 * Second easiest method: Google search ""Polling place [zip code]"" in which [zip code] is your zip code.
 * [Can I Vote?](http://www.canivote.org/#) Expand ""Find your polling place,"" select your state and follow through on your state's website.
 * [Rock the Vote - Election Center](http://www.rockthevote.com/election-center/) Again, select your state and find the nearest polling place.


**Voting from your couch**

 * [Absentee and Early voting via. The National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx) If you cannot get to a polling place for whatever reason you still have options!  Many states have mail in ballots for early or absentee voting.  Hit up the link for a comprehensive list.


**Additional advice**

 * Ask for the day off from work.  For whatever reason Election Day is *not* a national holiday, you need to plan in advance!
 * Spread the word around.  Many people are completely oblivious to electoral cycles, you can and should inform them.
 * Voting is fast, easy and reasonable fun.  You have no excuse not to vote.
