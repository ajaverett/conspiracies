1,I've researched the afterlife for nearly 10 years. I am convinced that Reptilian beings are REAL and that the tunnel of light that people see when they die is a trap.,5970.0,pyizkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pyizkn/ive_researched_the_afterlife_for_nearly_10_years/,1985.0,1633005788.0,"**Introduction**

For the last 10 years, I have been researching the nature of our reality, who or what controls our society from the shadows, and more importantly what actually happens when the physical body dies and the soul leaves the body. Do we go to heaven? Do we go to hell? Do we just cease to exist? Is there a God that takes care of us? Once you begin to realize what's actually going on and how deep the rabbit hole really goes, you will never see the world in the same way so buckle up and get ready, this is not going to be easy to swallow for most people. The whole point of this post is not to frighten you, but to present you the conclusions that I've come to in regards to what actually happens when our physical bodies die after having done what feels like endless research from every angle possible.

I have thoroughly investigated near death experiences, out-of-body experiences, astral projection experiences, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data, gnosticism, ancient texts and more. I cannot say I know with absolute certainty what happens when we die, but what I do know is that all these different ways/methodologies of researching lead to the same conclusions and because of that, I believe that Earth is a prison planet and a massive farm used by various parasitic entities who are using us and have been using us as energetic food for what appears to be a very long time. I will share plenty of evidence from different sources and perspectives to make you understand how I connected all these dots and why I came to these conclusions. I promise you that the deeper you research this stuff the more you will begin to realize that this is extremely real, important, and it's possibly affecting every single one of us. All I'm asking you is to keep an open mind and to analyze the evidence yourself. 

Different sources that have nothing to do with each other indicate the same scenario, so what I'm about to explain below is the conclusion of all these sources. I listed all the sources at the end of the post. This post isn't necessarily about what one person is saying, it's about what the evidence is showing.

**Reincarnation and the white tunnel of light**

You know how anyone who's had a near death experience talks about having seen a tunnel of light appear in front of them? Or having met members of their family who had passed away? In some rare cases, even having met and spoken to who they thought was God? My research suggests that the tunnel of light which appears when we die is a trap designed to wipe the whole memory of our last incarnation and to recycle our souls into another body thus keeping us in an infinite loop here on Earth. Because of this, the overwhelming majority of people walking the Earth have total amnesia and don't remember anything about their past existences nor anything from the periods in-between their lives. If you do some research though, you will notice that there is however a small number of people world-wide who are able to recall very specific details regarding who they were, what they did for a living, where they lived in a past life, etc([evidence 1](https://youtu.be/9w2MCpzE8u0?t=60),[evidence 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcsqOBUdK28),[evidence 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is),[evidence 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ty-TdWKM0)). 

How do we know these people aren't making up their stories? There's lots of people out there who have been able to bring very solid pieces of evidence to sustain their claims and those claims can be verified([verified evidence 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnXxC-nVsJY&t=8s),[verified evidence 2](https://yogaesoteric.net/en/definite-evidence-and-maybe-even-proof-of-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 3](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140521/lifestyle-offbeat/article/3-yr-old-recalls-past-life-murder-identifies-killer-and-locates-his/),[verified evidence 4](https://newspunch.com/scientific-breakthrough-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 5](https://infinityexplorers.com/the-reincarnation-of-shanti-devi-the-girl-who-identified-her-previous-life-family),[verified evidence 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is&ab_channel=ThingsAreChangingProductions)) which shows that reincarnation is a very real phenomenon,  despite what some of the world's religions claim to happen to the soul when a person dies. The reason these people's memories have only been partially erased and not fully erased remains unknown for now.

The reason people that went through NDE's didn't come back with their memories wiped is because unlike people who have died, they didn't end up going all the way through the tunnel of light to reach it's destination, many NDE'rs didn't enter the tunnel at all, while some have partially experienced it. All of them managed to return to their bodies and lived to tell what they experienced on the other side, hence the term 'near death experience'.

**The astral(spirit) realm, the reptilians and their agenda**

The Reptilians are found in the literature of multiple ancient cultures across the globe. Jainism and Hindu talk about the 'NAGA' whom they describe as 'half-human half-serpent deities'. The aztecs used to worship the 'Quetzalcoatl' whom they described as the ""serpent-like God"". The Hopi Indians in North America referred to a race of reptoids called the 'Sheti', translated ""Snake-Brothers"". In Africa, shamans claim to bear extensive esoteric knowledge of a race of reptilian beings called the Chitauri, whom they say control the Earth. Chinese, Korean and Japanese legends talk about a race of reptilian beings called the ""Kappa"". The Gnostics talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use humans as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies.

[The Reptilians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEMXvjv0M2E&ab_channel=TheInternationale) are both physical and astral beings. They've been heavily involved in the manipulation of mankind for thousands of years and are responsible for setting up [the soul trap around the planet](https://humansbefree.com/2015/07/soul-catching-net-we-are-recycled-at-death-to-remain-in-the-matrix.html) with the help of extremely advanced technology. This energy grid around the planet serves multiple purposes, one of it's main purposes is to project this 'grandiose' tunnel of light in the proximity of people who have just died in order to lure their souls in. This is the same tunnel of light that so many people who've had near death experiences have reported seeing on the other side. The soul may be under the impression that the tunnel is going to take it to the Heavens or perhaps to a higher plane of existence, depending on it's level of awareness. In reality, when a soul enters the tunnel, it's memory gets wiped and the soul is put into another body here on Earth(reincarnation).  The tunnel acts as a bait and to make a good analogy, imagine a fisherman and his fishing rod: he throws in the bait which hides the hook and the fish get trapped in it when they bite. We get tricked and trapped by the tunnel of light in a similar way if we aren't aware that it is a trap. In this case, we're the fish. The Reptilians are highly intelligent, highly advanced technologically and they lack empathy which makes them dangerous. These beings see themselves as 'Gods' and humanity as their enslaved cattle.

The reason they want to keep us here is because they need to feed off of us energetically: when people go through any kind of suffering, these entities feed off of our lower frequency emotions such as fear, pain, grief, anger, jelousy, rage, anxiety, lust, because they are low vibrational beings that require low vibrational energy in order to survive. Rudolf Steiner, one of the most prolific and gifted scientists, philosophers, and esotericists of his time [explains how the Archons feed off of our fear and anxiety](https://www.shiftfrequency.com/steiner-describes-archontic-parasites/).

The majority of people living on this planet today have been continously reincarnating on this planet for thousands of years because we keep falling for the same trap when our physical bodies die. Most of us have no memories of our past existences since our memories get wiped before every reincarnation, so every time we are born on this planet we think we've just arrived for the first time with a grand purpose or mission to fulfill given to us by who we think is God. 

> ""*Our consciousness interacts with another dimension. Our physical sensors only show us a 3-dimensional universe. What exists in the higher dimensions are entities we cannot touch with our physical sensors*""  - **Bernard Carr**, professor of mathematics and astronomy who studied under Stephen Hawking and earned his doctorate at Cambridge.

When our physical bodies die or when we have an out-of-body experience, our soul goes into the astral(spirit) realm and while we can still observe what's happening on Earth but we can no longer interact with physical matter. These parasitic entities exist mainly but not exclusively in the astral plane. It's crucial that we become aware of the fact that these entities who are masters of deceit play 'God' in order to trick us into accepting reincarnation and thus having our memories wiped, convincing us that it's in our best interest to do so. 

How are they able to do that, you may ask? When we're out of our bodies the laws of physics as we know them no longer have the same effects upon us as we find ourselves in a different realm in which we are able to do things that would be impossible in the physical world. Our souls are pure energy, so in the astral/spirit realm, we can change the shape of our astral body(spirit) into anything we want by simply willing it to happen because unlike in the physical world, we can use our consciousness to manifest a different looking body in an instant when we're in the astral plane, since we are no longer affected by physical laws and limitations. We can also fly around or teleport by simply using our intention to do so. We can even go to higher vibratory realms(where the real good-hearted beings live) if our vibration is high enough.

> ""*If you want to find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration*"" - **Nikola Tesla**

If you understand that in the astral, any entity can change the shape of it's astral body into anything it wishes to, then you realize that even the most malevolent entity possible can present itself to you in a different form to trick you into thinking you're speaking to God or to your guardian angel, or even to one of the members of your family who had passed away. They do this because they know you'd put your trust in these religious figures or in the familiar faces and once they gained that trust they can easily manipulate you into doing things that are not in your best interests at all. They masquerade as 'beings of light' that emanate a fake sensation of love and peace to make you think they're the good guys who are there to guide you and to give you your next ""mission to fulfill"".

This is mentioned even in the bible:

> ""*And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light*"" - **II Corinthians 11:14**

---

**Afterlife tricks & scams**

If you don't enter the tunnel of light when your time comes, you need to be aware that these entities will present themselves to you in the form of angels/Jesus/God/saints/guides/ascended masters/guardian angels and they're going to try to convince you that you need to go back to Earth so you can pay back your ""karmic debt"" or to continue ""learning"" or that you have to go back with a ""special mission to fulfill"" which is complete bullshit but we keep falling for these scams because they tend to make sense from our narrow and pre-programmed perspectives(good luck fulfilling that ""special mission"" if you can't remember what the ""mission"" was). We put blind trust in what they say to us because of constant religious indoctrination during our lives on Earth and these beings know that.

They can't force us to reincarnate because each soul has free will, but they can pretend to be someone they're not in order to put ideas in our head that it's in our best interest to accept reincarnating back on Earth making it sound as if they are doing us a favor so that we can ""evolve"", ""learn"" or ""fix previous mistakes"" and what they're basically doing is they're using our own free will against us. The real purpose of continuous reincarnation is soul enslavement disguised as ""spiritual evolution"". [A free will decision is impossible without memory and information](https://humansarefree.com/2018/03/saying-no-to-reincarnation-and-regaining-your-freedom.html).

Because our memories are being wiped after each life time, many of us live under the illusion that we're currently living our first life on this planet and we came here to ""learn"". Learning about life on Earth and experiencing it would be useful if we didn't lose our memories after each life time. But it doesn't matter what we learn over here as long as everything gets erased after each reincarnation and we have to relearn everything from scratch over and over again in an endless loop. Earth is a prison planet camouflaged as a 'cosmic school'. This idea of a cosmic school has been going around in order to trick souls into wanting to come and stay here in order to ""learn"". This whole [matrix](http://howtoexitthematrix.com/2017/06/20/what-is-the-matrix-and-how-do-we-exit-from-it/) is designed to drain our energy, wipe our memories over and over again and keep us trapped.

Many people that went through near death experiences even recall being accompanied by a ""loving"" angel who showed them their life review. The reason the entities show us life reviews is so we can relive certain moments from our lives in which we made certain mistakes and by reliving those moments, feelings of guilt, shame and remorse are being generated inside of us, making us want to compensate for them. These beings then use these feelings against us telling us things such as: ""You have made these mistakes, you have to go back to fix this and that"". Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes, so their emotional manipulation scam will never end if you buy into it because being human it's impossible to not make what we perceive to be humanly mistakes. [This NDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulN1vUayvM&ab_channel=NearDeathExperiences) for example shows how one woman is shown not one **but two fake life reviews** in order to convince her to go back.

**""New Age"" believers who promote calling upon ""your"" spirit guides, guardian angels, ascended masters and religious figures for help,  are actually doing huge damage to themselves and to all of humanity and they are not even aware of it. You are everything you need to succeed. You are a powerful creator being and you don't need to give your power away to anybody**.

**How they're using your religious beliefs against you**

Religion has programmed you to believe that at the moment of your death, a spiritual judgement type of scenario will take place(the biblical Judgement) and it will be expected of you to give your authority away to these beings (God,angels,guides) letting them decide your fate, so that when your time actually does come, you won't even question these beings and what they are doing with you, instead you will simply accept whatever they ask from you because everything will seem to be going as planned, since that's what religion programmed you to believe will happen when your physical life will end.

These entities take advantage of the fact that you have been continuously conditioned to believe in an afterlife saviour who will take you to the Heavens if you're a good boy. Even if you're an atheist, when you see this ""God"" or ""Jesus"" figure right there in front of you in the astral, you may start to have second thoughts about what you thought about religion back on Earth and you will most likely end up accepting what these entities want you to do because your perception of reality can change in an instant in a shocking and surprising scenario like that. 

Religion has also given you the sense of being a guilty sinner who has to worship, obey and pray to a certain God(depending on your religion) in the hopes of afterlife salvation. The real salvation is not coming from the parasitic entities who pretend to be our creators, it is coming from ourselves. In order for this to happen, we have to become aware of what actually awaits us when we die so we can use our free will to put an end to this vicious reincarnation cycle. 

The real, powerful, infinite, creator God (who has nothing to do with any religious movement) is already within you. You are Source energy. We are the saviours we have been waiting for and we don't need to give our power away to anybody.

Think about this: if you're born somewhere in Europe/North America/South America for example, then the main religions of those areas tell you that God put you on this Earth to live your life and at the end of that life, there will be judgement. God will then decide whether you'll go to Heaven or Hell, for eternity. But, what if you're born in other areas of the world such as the Middle East? or India? or any country/region in which the main religion is either Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism? These religions teach that after death there is reincarnation, no heaven no hell. So why is it that the place we're born in on this planet dictates a certain belief in something so important such as our existence beyond physical life? Will random luck really going to dictate what's going to happen to each one of us at the moment of our death? Will each one of us have a different afterlife fate just because we're born in different places around the world? It is all part of their game of deception, but the more you expand your awareness the easier you can see through the lies and deceit of the social and religious programming that we've all been through one way or another.

**Why is Source energy/the creator of this Universe allowing all this to happen?**

Each being in this Universe, whether malevolent or benevolent, has free will. Ask yourself: why are we humans allowed to enslave the animals here on Earth? [Why are we allowed to slaughter more than 3 billion animals on a  **daily** basis?](https://sentientmedia.org/how-many-animals-are-killed-for-food-every-day/) Why are we allowed keep animals locked up in farms and cages until the day they die? Why are we allowed to be so cruel to the other forms of life? Why? Because we, just like these entities do, have free will. From our perspective, we do these things because we need something from them which is energy in the form of physical food. We think we are entitled to do what we do because we are superior to them and because we need to survive. We perceive these things to be normal and part of life. From the perspective of the animals however, if they were aware of it, we would be their 'reptilians' since we operate just like them. But we never see ourselves that way, we don't think we're the bad guys because all we do is try to survive. The entities don't see themselves as the bad guys either since they're also trying to survive. What we do to the animals is almost exactly what these beings do to us and they need to keep us imprisoned here to feed off of us just like farmers keep their cattle locked up in farms and stables to get what they need from them.

**Evidence #1: The perspective of past life regression hypnosis** 

Calogero Grifasi is a past life regression hypnotist from Italy. He has posted thousands of past life regression sessions on youtube that explain what happens to the soul inbetween lives, how the Reptilians feed off of us energetically while we're physically on Earth and how they try to manipulate us into accepting reincarnation when we die by disguising themselves as religious figures in the astral.

I've analyzed more than 400 sessions of his with different clients from all over the world but the following sessions are one of the most significant sessions he's posted in English that you need to see for yourself:


Session 1: [**Entity masquerades as Jesus to entrap souls upon death**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mh5cGA7RgM&) - This is an investigative session on the reincarnation cycle to find out what happens to a soul inbetween lives and it shows how a soul is being deceived by astral entities to reincarnate back on Earth.

Session 2: [**This session shows how Reptilian entities interfere with us during and after our lives on Earth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXAnbS494zM&).



Session 3: [**This session reveals stuff about alien technology and how the entities use religions in their favor and against us**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HFOecADZeM&).


Session 4: [**Another session which reveals that Earth acts as a soul reincarnation trap for anyone who decides to incarnate here which confirms the information coming from the other sources with other clients**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czqCLvn8TSw).


The information that's coming out of Calogero's sessions doesn't actually come from himself directly, as he is the person who investigates and asks the questions, the information is coming from people that are able to enter the hypnotic state of mind which are either his clients or people who enter the hypnotic state for his clients. He has posted thousands of sessions with different people from all over the world that talk about encountering the same type of entities who play 'God', 'Jesus',""angels"" that trick people into reincarnating back on Earth and having their memories completely erased. Feel free to research as many of his hypnotic sessions as you'd like, [here's his sessions in italian and spanish that are subtitled in english](https://www.youtube.com/@calogerogrifasi/search?query=_EN_). He also has other channels in other languages or subtitled in french,german,spanish,polish,romanian,russian,portuguese,etc that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/calogerogrifasi/channels?view=49&shelf_id=62).

---

Here's an american woman who also practices past life regression hypnosis and while she has nothing to do with Calogero Grifasi, [she came to the same conclusions](https://redd.it/tbqk61) about the afterlife with her own clients.

Moreover, the work of other past life regressionists such as [William Criado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFG-j0XlDcI&ab_channel=WilliamCriado) and [Aurelio Mejia](https://www.youtube.com/c/AurelioMej%C3%ADa/videos) also reveals that the Reptilians use us as a food source and trick us into reincarnating back here when our physical bodies die (unfortunately their work is entirely in spanish but you can turn on subtitles on youtube if you don't speak or understand spanish).

There's 4-5 different past life regressionists (that I know of, there's probably more) who discovered the same thing about the afterlife after each of them worked with different clients from all over the world.

**Evidence #2: The perspective of Gnosticism & Buddhism**

The word 'Gnostic' comes from the term 'gnosi' in greek which means 'knowledge'. The Gnostics were a group of people who seeked to reveal the truth of the supreme essence of the divine, thus overthrowing false beliefs of God, society and life in general. They say that humans are divine souls trapped in the physical world and that the only way one could attain salvation from this place is not through worshiping the Demiurge(the false God of religion) but through gaining secret esoteric knowledge about who you really are, where you came from, and about how these parasitic entities operate, which will eventually set you free from this physical world in which your soul is trapped in. In the Gnostic texts, they talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use us as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies. The Gnostic texts describe at length the manipulation of humankind by what they call non-human 'Archons' or rulers. The soul trap is also mentioned in [The Secret Book of John](https://redd.it/wdhamk), which confirms the information coming from other sources. More information about the gnostic beliefs can be found [here](https://www.worldhistory.org/Gnosticism/).

Buddhism teaches that reincarnation is an endless cycle of suffering (the wheel of Samsara) that can only be broken by achieving enlightment. In other words, we are stuck in a reincarnation cycle where we are bound to continuously suffer one way or another, life after life, until we spiritually wake up and break free from the reincarnation cycle.

**Evidence #3: The perspective of Remote Viewing**

Remote viewing or 'extra sensory perception' was developed in the 1970's by the CIA and was used for espionage purposes. Remote viewing is the ability of a human being to perceive information and imagery of remote geographical targets, regardless of time and space. While this is a natural ability, it is very hard to do without training.  [Here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9CbLV3t-qo&ab_channel=TechnicalIntuition) that teaches you the basics. People who effectively use remote viewing aren't special, they are simply highly trained individuals and anyone can learn how to do it. 

[Farsight Institute](https://farsight.org/index.html) has some of the best remote viewers on the planet today. Amongst many different projects, they have investigated the afterlife and the Reptilians using remote viewing techniques:

In a project called [The Death Traps](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Death_Traps_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), 3 highly trained remote viewers from the Farsight Institute were tasked to remote view what happens to the soul of a person when the psysical body dies. All 3 of them perceived the exact same scenario without communicating with each other, that the soul is confused, disoriented and ends up entering a tunnel of light which violently shocks the soul. Immediately after that, the soul no longer has the memory of who it was and where it come from. I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In another Farsight project called [The Escape](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Escape_main_page.html), they have investigated how Earth has long been used as a prison planet. The remote viewers have been able to psychically perceive the grid that surrounds the Earth which is being used to ""zap"" souls who attempt to go through it. Again, I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In many other remote viewing projects made by Farsight Institute such as [Area 51](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Area_51_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Oumuamua](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Oumuamua_and_Bird_of_Prey_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Zeus](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Zeus_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [The War In Heaven](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/War_In_Heaven_Farsight_Project_main_page.html) among others, they have often psychically perceived these agressive, evil-looking Reptilian beings with psychopathic minds who always try to control, conquer and manipulate other beings. 

You can find free to watch and pay to watch projects made by Farsight [here](https://farsight.org/).

---

Brett Stewart, another skilled remote viewer along with his team (they have nothing to do with Farsight Institute) have also investigated the afterlife. Their afterlife project is called 'Moksha' which means ""freedom from the reincarnation cycle"" in hindu. Brett and his team have reached very similar conclusions about the afterlife which only makes the information coming from Farsight's remote viewers seem even more credible. 

Brett and the other three trained remote viewers have remote viewed their target, ""Moksha"" blindly. None of the remote viewers have communicated before or during the experiment and only shared their findings and common denominators when all the remote viewing data was already collected. [You can watch their project here](https://odysee.com/@SergeantSchultz:2/Samsara-and-Rebirth:b).

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of remote viewing:


[This CIA document is not showing anything in regards to the prison planet stuff, but I'm just sharing it to prove that the CIA have been using remote viewing since at least the 80's](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R000700070001-8.pdf).

[This declassified CIA document shows that in 1984 the government remote viewed the planet Mars 1 million years B.C and found strange looking entities there](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf).

**Evidence #4: The perspective of Robert Monroe**

Robert Monroe was the father of out-of-body experiences and astral projection. After having had out-of-body experiences for more than 30 years, Monroe discovered that our reality is used to create and harvest what he calls 'loosh' energy(emotional energy that every being produces). He claims that this universe has been enslaved for the production of loosh energy by inter-dimensional beings who see themselves as rulers and humanity as their enslaved cattle. His book [Far Journeys](https://www.amazon.com/Far-Journeys-Trilogy-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385231822) gives detailed information about loosh, [here's some references from his book](https://redd.it/te0fgs).
 Robert Monroe also claims that another source of loosh is humans’ worship of Gods.

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of astral projection and out-of-body experiences, [this being one of them](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf).

**Evidence #5: The perspective of psychedelic experiencers** 

[Many people who've done psychedelics reported a certain kind of experience indicating that this place is either a prison planet or a soul farm and that we are being farmed energetically](https://redd.it/zyzx0t), which confirms the information coming from other sources that have nothing to do with psychedelics, such as gnosticism, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data and also Robert Monroe's out of body experiences and research.

---

**Evidence #6: The perspective of David Icke**

For the last 30 years, David Icke has been a full-time investigator into who and what is actually controlling our society from the shadows. David Icke believes that the universe is made up of vibrational energy and consists of an infinite number of dimensions. His vast research suggests that an inter-dimensional race of Reptilian beings have hijacked the Earth and continuously manipulate global events in order to keep humans controlled and in constant fear.

[In this video David talks about how the Reptilians control our society, why the human eye is unable to see them and how they use us as an energetic food source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaF7NgnfCc). 

[David Icke talking about the Archons, Gnosticism & The Reptilian Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzCDwGUiHBU&).

David Icke has wrote more than 20 books about how our society actually works and who runs it. His books are extremely well researched. One of his books gives detailed information about the way the Reptilians operate and how they manipulate us: [Children of the Matrix: How an Interdimentional Race Has Controlled the Planet for Thousands of Years - And Still Does](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/dp/0957630891/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=david+icke&qid=1608115915&s=books&sr=1-5): ""*We are born into a world controlled by unseen forces that have plagued and manipulated humanity for thousands of years*"".

**Evidence #7: The perspective of Wes Penre**

[Wes Penre](https://wespenrevideos.com/about/) is a researcher of metaphysics, the alien presence on Earth, the matrix that we find ourselves in, our human origins, and much more.

[In this article](https://battleofearth.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/article-2-the-death-trap-and-how-to-avoid-it/), Wes explains how the tunnel of light death trap works and how to avoid it. The information is very complex but extremely well researched.

Wes has provided massive amounts of information on a wide range of topics: The illuminati, the shadow government, the moon matrix, the afterlife, entity possession, reptilian manipulation, the reincarnation soul trap and much, much more. [Here is his entire work in PDF's](https://wespenre.com/7-first-to-fifth-level-of-learning-in-pdf/).

**Evidence #8: The perspective of Simon Parkes**

[Simon Parkes](https://www.simonparkes.org/about) was an elected politician in the UK who served a full term of office. He claims to have had alien experiences his entire life, including experiences with the Reptilians. He also comes from a family with a background in the secret services (Mi5 and Mi6).

[In this segment from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6dxXAAAIp4)(listen from 1:11:47 to 1:19:57), Simon talks about the tunnel of light being a soul trap and that near death experiencers are being genuine in regards to what they've seen on the other side, but that they're not aware that it is all a trap designed to recycle their souls and wipe their memories clean.

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKf-S-PdA50&ab_channel=ChrisTurnerFilms), Simon talks about the fact that the system doesn't want to publicize the Reptilians because they signed an agreement with them to not be publicized and that the Reptilian race has been manipulating humanity for thousands of years.

**Evidence #9: The perspective of George Kavassilas**

Spiritual teacher and alien experiencer George Kavassilas, [talks about the false messiah that people unknowingly worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YgK-JCkmrc) ""*there are beings who come from a very dark place who have mastered to ability to pose as beings of love and light*"". 

[George talks about the Demiurge (or the false God of religions) who pretends to be our creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQPaXJ3355g&ab_channel=GnosticInfinity).

In this podcast, George [talks about the Matrix we find ourselves in, the ""God virus"" and how people naively worship, obey and pray to the very entities that enslave and harvest our souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKWPxKSUgQ).

**Evidence #10: The perspective of Val Valerian**

Val Valerian is a former CIA agent (real name John Grace) who started writing about the soul reincarnation trap and about Earth being a prison planet in the 1990's. In one of his books he writes:

“*It is they (grey aliens) who await in the light when a human being dies. The human being is then recycled into another body and the process begins all over again… Hence the Light and Tunnel at death Trap. Scanning someone they wish to recycle as they near death, the aliens discover who the person was close to has died. They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper. If you CHOOSE to follow you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice… these entities view Earth as a big farm.*” - Val Valerian

His books give detailed information about this place being a prison planet, aliens manipulating us, soul harvesting, soul traps and more: [Matrix II](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-II-Abduction-Manipulation-Technology/dp/B000LPJ46U) & [Matrix V](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Quest-Spirit-Ultimate-Frontier/dp/B000UQ9PAK).

**Evidence #11: The perspective of Alex Collier**

Alex Collier claims to be in contact with an ET race from the constellation of Andromeda. According to him, ""the Draconians(reptilians) are the force behind the repression of human populations everywhere in this galaxy"". He goes into detail about that [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEm8ovIuik&ab_channel=OysteinSvendsen). 

[In this clip, Alex Collier gives instructions on how to escape the tunnel of light soul reincarnation trap at death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GynOkYGChro&ab_channel=SoulTrapMatrix). He claims that if you ignore the tunnel of light and you say to yourself ""I wish to go home"" you will return to the dimension you came from before you came to Earth. While I personally don't think that this will work since you no longer have the memory of your old home nor the memory of the coordinates of your old home, I guess it's worth a try. But you must always have a plan b in case things don't go as planned.

Some of Alex's interviews and lectures over the years can be found [here](https://www.alexcollier.org/articles/).

Can we be 100% sure that Alex Collier has really been in contact with these beings from Andromeda? No! However, the information that he puts forward does confirm the information coming from the other sources regarding the Reptilians, the tunnel of light trap, and regarding what awaits us when we die, so I will still consider it evidence.

**Evidence #12: The perspective of Wayne Bush**

Massive research on the afterlife made by researcher Wayne Bush indicates that the white tunnel of light is luring souls into a mind-wipe reincarnation trap, how the Demiurge(false God entity) controls our society and more:

**Final words**

Waking up to the possibility that we could be living on a prison planet can be unsettling, disturbing, depressing but also enlightening, awakening and liberating. However if we are to do something about our situation, then it must be known.
 
The same information that I presented here is being confirmed by a variety of different sources which in my opinion is evidence that there's a lot of truth to this theory. I don't pretend to know the absolute truth nor am I saying that the information that I've presented you is the absolute truth. The only thing I can say is these are the conclusions I've reached about our reality and the afterlife after having researched them for many years. If anyone says that they are 100% sure, without a shadow of a doubt, about what happens when we die, then that person is a fraud in my opinion. Nobody will be able to get to the 100% absolute truth about this stuff, but what you can do is to research this topic from every angle/perspective possible so that you can put as many puzzle pieces together as you can which will allow you to have a greater understanding of who we really are, where we came from and what we're actually on this planet for, so **do not stop here. I highly encourage you to do your own research on this subject and to try to come up with your own conclusions about what awaits us when we die**. Most people only rely on what religion and the bible tells them about the afterlife and never do any individual research themselves whatsoever. Religion offers one perspective, not the full picture.

**You are an infinite, powerful creator being who will never cease to exist** but if your soul is put in a new body with no memory of your previous incarnations then that's as close to 'dying' on a soul level as you'll get because you'll be reborn as a completely new person who has to relearn everything from scratch, a new version of you who will never know the old version of you and what you were all about. So good luck in your journey to find the truth about the afterlife.",conspiracy,NSA

First of all, many thanks to the moderators of r/Conspiracy for giving us the space to present the proof that there was no Russian hack and take any questions people may have about it.

Here's some context about who I am and what I've done, taken from my Wikipedia page.

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.  
>  
>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.  
>  
>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).  
>  
>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Trailblazer was a modification of ThinThread, removing the encryption and auditing aspects, while expanding the mass data collection. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

[In 2017 I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at President Donald Trump's request to talk about my evidence that there was no ""Russian Hack""](https://larouchepac.com/20190506/former-nsa-technical-director-william-binney-must-testify-congress-expose-big-lie-russia). He promised me follow up meetings that never happened, and I would suspect the President was ever briefed.

Three key points that are essential to know.

1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

3.) The NSA would have known the hack was taking place, and would have direct evidence of it. We know this thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied.

Mr. Binney was kind enough to provide photo verification for this AMA which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/F1IHym8).

This AMA is of particular interest as Mr. Binney's AMA earlier this week-on another subreddit-[was censored mid way through his scheduled time slot.](https://twitter.com/Burke4Senate/status/1298318463610560512?s=20)

For those unaware;

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA)[4] and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.

>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.

As to the issue of the 2016 DNC hack, Mr. Binney has the following to say in the text of [his initial (censored) AMA](https://archive.is/RMhh3);

>Remember when emails released by Wikileaks proved that the DNC rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders? And everyone claimed that the Russians had hacked the DNC?

>There's only one problem. There was no hack.

>It was an internal leak.

>Here's my proof

>It boils down to these three key points:

>1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

>2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

- The Imperial Japanese Army's notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html (http://archive.is/hojxN)

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

- Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.[3] This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades.

- Tulsa Race Riot - On May 31 and June 1, 1921, a white mob started the Tulsa race riot, attacking residents and businesses of the African-American community of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in what is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in United States history. The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot

I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.
Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.
With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.
You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""
""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.
Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.
You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.
This all happened in the country where I live.
You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.
Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?
Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?
I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.
I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.",conspiracy,NSA

I suppose you could say that maybe you got some breadcrumbs. Maybe some of you got a tax break? Saved up a few extra dollars? But many of us had our small businesses go under during the pandemic.

When it comes to the important stuff, and promises that were made by Trump, like exposing the global crime syndicate, investigating and auditing the central banks, restoring our civil liberties taken from us from the NDAA and the patriot act, ending the wars abroad, and dismantling unnecessary and intrusive big government agencies, nothing changed and nothing was even done.

Why would people take to the streets to defend an administration that didn’t do a fucking thing for us? Why are we still holding onto the idea that this administration was any different, and that he is not just another NWO puppet? because of some tacky political theatre that is making you all emotionally invested in the political soap opera and taking things at face value?

If we *really* want to change things, we have to acknowledge the truth, that this administration was no different than the last, and the next one will be the same, **because they all serve the same criminal enterprise.** Trump was just another puppet for the New World Order.

The first rule you need to know is conspiracy theorist was a weaponized term by the CIA to make people fall in line, and ridicule anyone who opposed the status quo narrative. Politicians LOVE this term, because it enables their goals while simultaneously encouraging you to mock anyone who speaks out.

The second rule is everything you have heard regarding conspiracies, while it contains falsehoods, is relatively true in one way or another. This is just a Reddit post intended to point you in the right direction so I won’t make a super in depth post but I encourage all to do their due diligence and research these subjects, as I’ve learned it’s the only way the majority will reach *the truth* anyways.

“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812).

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions) 

Bush = evil. Clinton = evil. Obama = evil. Older Bush = evil.   HERES the difference.. Trump = somewhat disrespectful idiot who is not a career politician or ties to public office (senate/house/president/VP) but actually likes America and opposes the Globalist agenda.

ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people.

Nor does he do honorable things like release tax returns or present real forward thinking ideas or policies. I end it with acknowledging *no matter what candidate takes office the next 4 years will be hell.* However, the shill crowd immediately comes in and glosses over the MAIN parts of what I’m saying here, which is conspiracy theories related to government and politics are for the most part true, to research agencies and institutions that contribute to the stripping of your rights in modern day propaganda in broad daylight, especially the CIA.",conspiracy,NSA

These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.

Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.

The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.

The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.

The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.

NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.

The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.

Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.

If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone.

The police and surveillance state predicted in the forward-looking 1940s classic ""1984"" by George Orwell, has slowly, but steadily, come to fruition. However, like a frog sitting idly in a pan of steadily-warming water, too many Americans still seem unaware that the slow boil of big government is killing their constitutional liberties.

The latest sign of this stealth takeover of civil rights and freedom was epitomized in recent Senate testimony by FBI Director James Comey, who voiced his objections to civilian use of encryption to protect personal data – information the government has no automatic right to obtain.

As reported by The New American, Comey testified that he believes the government's spy and law enforcement agencies should have unfettered access to everything Americans may store or send in electronic format: On computer hard drives, in so-called i-clouds, in email and in text messaging – for our own safety and protection. Like many in government today, Comey believes that national security is more important than constitutional privacy protections or, apparently, due process. After all, aren't criminals the only ones who really have anything to hide?

In testimony before a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee entitled ""Going Dark: Encryption, Technology, and the Balance Between Public Safety and Privacy"" Comey said that in order to stay one step ahead of terrorists, as well as international and domestic criminals, Uncle Sam's various spy and law enforcement agencies should have access to available technology used to de-encrypt protected data. Also, he believes the government should be the final arbiter deciding when decryption is necessary.

What could go wrong there?

##Government, at all levels, is responsible

During the hearing, TNA reported, technology experts warned the panel that giving the FBI limitless access to the personal electronic data of Americans would open it up to exploitation by ""bad actors."" But Comey was having none of that.

""It is clear that governments across the world, including those of our closest allies, recognize the serious public safety risks if criminals can plan and undertake illegal acts without fear of detection,"" he told the committee.

""Are we comfortable with technical design decisions that result in barriers to obtaining evidence of a crime?""

So, in essence, Comey – like many before him, especially since the global war on terror was launched – believes that, in the name of national security Americans ought to give up more of their individual and constitutional rights because that's the only way we can be adequately protected.

Perhaps realizing that his Senate hearing testimony was public, Comey gave the Constitution a passing glance, noting that the government should respect the ""requirements and safeguards of the laws"" and the country's founding document. However, as Americans now know, spy agencies during the past two presidential administrations have been tasked increasingly with conducting warrantless, unchecked surveillance of Americans' electronic data and communications.

But all of this is not on men like Comey and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Congress bears its share of responsibility, too.

##This is the way it is – shut up and take it

When such activities of the National Security Agency were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, many in the media and among the American electorate were quick to blame the agency, as if it was somehow acting out of rogue instinct.

The reality is, however, that the agency is tasked to perform its duties– either by statutory law (think the USA Patriot Act) or by presidential directive (think Bush's order after 9/11 to [conduct warrantless surveillance](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html?_r=1)).

""We are not asking to expand the government's surveillance authority, but rather we are asking to ensure that we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that Congress has provided to us to keep America safe,"" Comey said during the Senate hearing.

What does all this mean? It simply means that at every level, government considers its own citizens hostile.

Why now?  Why is the Pentagon all of a sudden admitting it is spending money on UFO research? Why are there multiple spottings of cigar shaped inter-stellar objects that could be  an alien spaceship, suddenly being reported on?  Why is Tom DeLonge all of a sudden being approached by former Pentagon officials to disclose UFOs?  Why is the military purposely flying squads of airplane at night in formations that can easily be mistaken as gigantic UFOs? 


Why you ask?


Because they need to come up with an explanation for trillions of missing dollars.   



Let’s think rationally for a moment.  The UFO phenomenon has been filmed since the 1940’s when Foo Fighters were first spotted. http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html  Over the decades there have been countless testimonies and sightings by credible sources (like military/commercial pilots) let alone hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage.  Ask anyone in the world if they know what a UFO is and they will answer yes.  Are we to believe that the strongest, the most advanced military in the world does not know everything there is to know about UFOs in 2010’s?  Are we to believe that the research into the topic only began on 2007 as according to the NYT?  Absurd!  How naïve do you have to be to believe such utter non-sense?


Enter the threat of the first-ever audit of the Pentagon and the DoD. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli   As the saying goes, they’re up the creek without a paddle.  Yes, they are missing AT LEAST $21 trillion by some estimates and as much as $29 trillion by more “sensationalistic” media outlets. http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/


Where did all this money go?  Well, I’d imagine some went to legit above top secret weapons research.  Now, most of these experiments probably failed, wasting trillions.  The military has every motivation to hide failed experiments while publicizing the crap out of successful ones.  Why?  Because repeated reports of failures will drive the public and Congress to doubt about funding future projects.  So they hide the unsuccessful results as much as possible.   They simply don’t want their revenue stream reduced.


Next?  Probably a significant amount went in to illegal operations and sensitive surveillance.  After all, you can’t actually put into accounting ledgers that we were spying on our closest allies or that we were responsible for certain insurrections in the Middle East, or that we’re actually protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan, right?   Or that we’re even spending vast resources monitoring our own population unconstitutionally.  No, no, all those things have to be off-the-books.


Finally, I suspect that large sums of money were embezzled or diverted to enrich the Military Industrial Complex.  All those extravagant perks don’t come cheap you know.  Who cares if the military pays $200k for an LCD monitor that costs $50 to make.  It’s all free money.  Well, to them that is, because it’s our money.


So, what to do?  How are the Pentagon and the DoD going to account for over $20 trillion in missing funds?  Well, you figure they’ll point to covert programs and secret development for up to $10 trillion or so.  But there’s just no way they’re going to come up with an acceptable explanation for all $20+ trillion.


That’s where the UFO patsy comes in.  Yes.  They are going to reveal that trillions that were actually squandered (or outright stolen) were justifiably spent on the following:
1.	To research and validate the existence of UFOs.
2.	To devise and construct early warning systems (such as a satellite network) that can detect UFOs encroaching on our space.
3.	To come up with feasible ways to defend ourselves against an unlikely but possible alien invasion.
4.	Labs and research centers dedicated to understanding how the UFOs function should they turn out to be real.
5.	Etc. etc. bla bla bla…


You see where they’re going with this?  When the entire planet is at stake, $10+ trillion in defense suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.   Of course, no evidence of actual development or proof of systems will ever be disclosed.  You know, national security and all.  But all this hinges on the majority of the population believing that UFO are real and that a credible threat is a possibility.  This is why more and more information will be released from the Pentagon in the coming months.  They want you to believe!


If you need proof of my argument, just look at the NY Times article.  
> In the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find.

The very first line of the article specifically states the amount spent on this program.  Why does it make such an emphasis in this insignificant amount of $22 million?  Simple.  They are trying to program us in to accepting that it is normal to spend money on UFO research.  Need more proof?  Look further down the article.
> “Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Do you see the psychological manipulation?  Do you see how the article is trying to make us believe that funding for UFO research is not only justified but absolutely necessary?


Don’t fall for this crap.  While I’m a firm believer in UFOs, I also know damn well that the DoD, CIA, NSA and just about every powerful agency in the country knows the full truth of UFOs.  They’ve known for decades!  They’re just trying to convince you that all that money that’s missing?  Well, that it was well spent.  They’re gonna claim they’re saving your ass from greys and reptilians so just be thankful.


In the coming months (and even years), the government will release more and more info on UFOs.  Do not fall for it.  It’s old news.  It’s stuff the govt has known for a long time, carefully packaged to make you think… “hmm, maybe we DO need to spend more money on UFO research and defense.”  It’s all a ruse.  It’s all a scam.  They’re just trying to cover their ass for the missing $29 trillion.  

This is the real “Project Blue Beam”.  It is to obfuscate and justify the trillions that have been illegally used by our own military.  


P.S.  Upon re-reading my post, I seem to be saying that UFOs definitely exists and the govt has been hiding it.  I am not.  I am saying the govt fully knows for sure whether they exist or not.  I do not know what they know.  All I'm saying is that they are using psyop to get people to question ""MAYBE UFOs exists"".   When enough people start questioning the existence of UFOs, their secret unaccounted $10+ trillion spent on supposed projects to verify UFOs will seem justified.  It will all be BS because they already know whether they exist or not and have known for decades.

I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.


[Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?](https://spectator.org/the-invisible-awan-brothers-scandal/)

[Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Won’t the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](https://investmentwatchblog.com/who-are-the-awan-it-staff-that-hacked-house-intelligence-computers-and-why-wont-the-media-cover-this-evidence-based-story-research-node/)







I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. 

Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm). Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511) and knew [Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch) and through [three degrees of separation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/) used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/). If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.






• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?

• The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. 

• The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. 





### The Media
Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.

>With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ) you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath.

Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569).

>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.

This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes...

>The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet.

 The media is [90% Democrat](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/) and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist.

###The Smoking Gun

[EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/exclusive-house-intelligence-it-staffers-fired-in-computer-security-probe/)

>[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html) is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.

>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.

>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.

>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.

Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/). Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers.

>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.


After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers.

>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.



The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/). House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. 

This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. 

Let's state that again...

D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the [Congressional members](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586) involved with the Awan Brothers. 

>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.

>""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.

Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. 

The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/) to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. 



>    Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.

>Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/).

Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.

[Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1)
>[frontpagemag](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield) |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.

>The [signatories to the letter](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf) were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.


Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418) and [Huma Abedin](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556) are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?

[http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/)
>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.

>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.




with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. 





















What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. 

While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. 

I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

This post has been updated and corrected with new information from US Capitol Police, which said no arrests have been made but there is an active investigation ongoing into IT staff who were involved in an alleged procurement scam. A lawmaker briefed on the situation had told BuzzFeed News that arrests were made.

'In what amounts to a pissing match on a national scale, a Utah state legislative committee will vote on a bill that could deprive a National Security Agency facility just outside Salt Lake City of its water, all in protest of the government agency’s collection of civilian data. Specifically, the bill prohibits municipalities from giving “material support or assistance in any form to any federal data collection and surveillance agency.”

The Washington Post’s Reid Wilson reports:

That’s a barely veiled reference to the Utah Data Center, a massive collection facility operated by the NSA in Bluffdale, a small suburb of Salt Lake City. The facility, completed last year at a cost of about $1.7 billion, houses super computers that require 65 megawatts of power, enough to power about 33,000 homes, according to the Associated Press.

All those computers require a lot of water, which keeps them cool. Bluffdale issued $3.5 million in bonds to pay for water lines that will eventually pump a million gallons a day into the facility. Bluffdale signed an agreement with the NSA that allows the agency to pay less for water than city ordinances would otherwise require.'

I don't understand how people are so dense

It's not going to stop with the kinect.

Verizon got a lot of shit last year for introducing a DVR with similar creepy features - talking about targeting contraceptive ads to people it detects romancing, etc...

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/dvr-camera-microphone-target-advertisements-based-recordings-users-014434311.html

Yeah a lot of kids are going to get it and have zero problems. They'll grow up loving the technology and have no problems being laser/IR scanned at every waking moment. No problem with that at all. We can trust companies that make electronics, no matter how invasive the tech is or how many times they get caught lying/aiding spy/law enforcement organizations

might as well copy/past this here too...

The kinect, and other viewer-monitoring devices, are going to change advertising and programming/content to levels you couldn't believe.

The IR will know which parts of commercials send the most blood to our cocks, or which tv-show arguments/news programs get us mad, what makes us happy, what we'll sit through, etc...

I personally think tv, and everything else ""entertainment"" now, is derogatory and pandering enough as it is. If they're going to be openly collecting this kind of data - and openly trying to monetize every aspect of it - and not so openly using it for scarier purposes...  

TV and movies are going to be TERRIBLE in ten years, not to mention how far the police state will advance by then...

This shouldn't be about gamers avoiding one company's product, it should be a society rejecting an *incredibly* invasive technology being foisted into our everyday lives

[Hillary’s EmailGate Goes Nuclear: Does the latest release of Hillary’s State Department emails include highly classified U.S. intelligence?](http://observer.com/2016/01/hillarys-emailgate-goes-nuclear/)

>Its information comes from a high-ranking source with direct access to Sudan’s top military and intelligence officials, and Mr. Blumenthal’s write-up repeatedly states the sources—there turn out to be more than one—are well-placed and credible, with excellent access. It’s the usual spytalk boilerplate when you want the reader to understand this is golden information, not just gossip or rumors circulating on the street, what professionals dismiss as “RUMINT.” Needless to add, this is generating a lot of talk in Sudan, where the media is asking about this shady affair—and how Mr. Blumenthal, who’s not exactly an old Africa hand, knew all about it.



>In fact, the June 8, 2011 Blumenthal report doesn’t read like CIA material at all, in other words human intelligence or HUMINT, but very much like signals intelligence or SIGINT. (For the differences see here). I know what SIGINT reports look like, because I used to write them for the National Security Agency, America’s biggest source of intelligence. SIGINT reports, which I’ve read thousands of, have a very distinct style and flavor to them and Blumenthal’s write-up matches it, right down to the “Source Comments,” which smack very much of NSA reporting and its “house rules.”


>But is this an NSA assessment? If so, it would have to be classified at least Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information, a handling caveat that applies to most SIGINT, and quite possibly Top Secret/SCI, the highest normal classification we have. In that case, it was about as far from Unclassified as it’s possible for an email to be.


>No surprise, NSA is aflutter this weekend over this strange matter. **One Agency official expressed to me “at least 90 percent confidence” that Mr. Blumenthal’s June 8 report was derived from NSA reports, and the Agency ought to be investigating the matter right now.**

76,"[OC] A reminder that the US Shadow Government legalized itself on 9/11 via ""Continuity of Government"".",918.0,aj2how,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aj2how/oc_a_reminder_that_the_us_shadow_government/,185.0,1548266664.0," The definition of 'Continuity of Government' is a set of contingency plans to ensure that essential government functions remain in place after a disaster such as nuclear war. In the United States, Continuity of Government plans have been on the books since at least the Eisenhower administration. The plans involved building intricate hidden command centers such as the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center built in 1959, nestled away in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

While the Government officially classifies Mt. Weather as a 'bunker', many sources claim that it is essentially a full blown city. According to GlobalSecurity.org, a respected institution in the intelligence community, Mount Weather contains a hospital, sewer treatment system, reservoirs, a power plant, an emergency television studio, and a thorough system of dormitories and office buildings.^1

None of this is out of the ordinary, so to speak. It is reasonable for the government to have such plans in place. However, **on September 11, 2001, the Continuity of Operations plan was officially activated and has been live ever since, meaning that Mt. Weather and similar installations are likely in operation today.**

> ,“A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States,” President George W. Bush proclaimed on September 14, 2001.

Dick Cheney officially enacted the “Continuation of Government” plans shortly after the World Trade Center attacks, although the Bush Administration would not confirm that this took place until March, 2002.^2 **A simultaneous 'State of Emergency' was declared and is also in effect today, extended each year by George Bush, Barack Obama, and then** [**Donald Trump**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/14/permanent-emergency-trump-becomes-third-president-renew-extraordinary-post-9-11-powers/661966001/)**.^3**

CBS reported:

> “A 'shadow government' consisting of 75 or more senior officials has been living and working secretly outside Washington since Sept. 11 in case the nation's capital is crippled by terrorist attack. ""This is serious business,"" President Bush said of plans to ensure the continuity of government.  

> Such an operation was conceived as a Cold War precaution against nuclear attack during the Eisenhower administration but never used until now. It went into effect in the first hours after the terror attacks and has evolved over time, said senior government officials who provided details of the plan.  

> Under the classified ""Continuity of Operations Plan,"" which was first reported by *The Washington Post* in its Friday editions, high-ranking officials representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the assignment at one of two fortified locations along the East Coast.  

> The Post said the first rotations were made in late October or early November, a fact confirmed by a senior government official late Thursday.  

> Officials who are activated for the duty live and work underground 24 hours a day, away from their families, according to the Post. The shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals.  

> The government-in-waiting is an extension of a policy that has kept Vice President Dick Cheney in secure, undisclosed locations away from Washington. Cheney has moved in and out of public view as threat levels have fluctuated.”^4

**Serious business indeed. There have been instances where Congressmen have been stonewalled when trying to learn more about the secret operations. One example is Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, pushed to review the classified portion of the Continuity plan in a secure setting in 2007 but his access was denied.^5**

What can we know about the Continuity of Operations plan currently in effect? Patrick Thronson, editor-in-chief of the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, has put together the most comprehensive publicly available paper detailing the states of emergencies and powers granted to the executive branch.^6 Available knowledge is naturally incomplete because many powers and documents are still classified. Some highlights include:

**•** **Congress is required by statue to vote on the continuation of a state of National Emergency every six months. Since September 11th, 2001, it has only happened once.**  

**•** **There are currently thirty simultaneous declared states of emergency.**  

• The Executive Branch can freeze the assets and prevent financial transactions of individuals. This extends to even basic life necessities. They can go as far as to prohibit donations of food to said person. 
 
• The president can unilaterally order the inspection and seizure of commercial vessels.  

• The president is authorized to suspend or alter rules for broadcast stations, or authorize control of said station.  

• Provisions to suspend or control internet traffic.  

**""Thus, the only apparent legal obstacle standing between present conditions and this degree of government control over mass media and telecommunications is a presidential order. "" – Thronson**  

• The ability to seize property  

• The delegation of 'maintaining law and order' to the department of defense.  

• Extend military tours of duty beyond contractually agreed termination dates.  

""A nation under thirty states of national emergency can hardly claim that emergency laws are the exception to—rather than the rule of—normal governance. "" – Thronson


Pretty fucking shocking, right? A legitimate shadow government revealed itself for a moment, and wields extreme powers secretly, and no one is talking about it.

This is such an important part of the puzzle. Everything is staged because this secret group of psychopaths is pulling the strings. This is the group that is truly controlling the actions of the NSA, DARPA, Military etc.

The implications are that the workings of Congress, the Justice Department, the Presidency and other institutions have become merely a show to distract from the reality that a secret government which does not respond to civilian rule and has granted itself sweeping, unchecked powers and is certainly directly operating in the realm of foreign policy, covert activities and likely domestic espionage, among other potential activities.

Think about how controlled the media has to be for no one to be talking about it. And how ridiculous the overton window of debate seems when you realize it is completely removed from reality.

We are all yelling at each other hating each other right now and it's this way by design, so we fight ourselves instead of the people truly controlling us.

Thanks for reading 

Love vibes, 
Timothy.

The plan is to keep this thread open and treat is a rolling AMA. So if your question wasn't answered today, it will be sometime!

These next days are a unique time to discuss the truth. That truth is that there is every intention to use the runaway capacities of the universal surveillance state, in the context of, and with respect to this most unusual American election in over 100 years, to set a precedent that would end American constitutional rule in the short term.

William Binney and J. Kirk Wiebe are specialists in this matter. They risked and lost their careers at the National Security Agency (NSA) directly after 9/11 in an attempt to fight the corruption at that agency. They want you to Ask Me Anything about what single individual citizens can do in the next hours and days to expose the state-and-above-state actors that must be called out NOW, so that the truth can set people free.

Many sailors, including James Cook tried searching for this supposedly massive southern landmass in vain. He eventually gave up, citing that there likely was a landmass below where he had sailed, but that is was of no importance. What did happen from his travels was a hivemind of opportunist hunters taking note of him seeing whales and seals.. and heading South to hunt. What ensued over the next few hundred years were tidbits of land being found here and there, always hinting that there was something much larger once you actually landed and explored, though this was not an easy task (obviously). Cue the explorers, the British Antarctic Expedition and every other country worth it’s salt in the late 1800s scrambling around this massive unknown continent to lay claim to it and explore the last real unexplored place on Earth.

Antarctica has nearly 90% of the ice and 70% of the fresh water on Earth, it was dictated in the Antarctic Treaty to be “in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purpose.” http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/1959-Antarctic-treaty.pdf

I recommend reading the treaty, it’s not long and a pretty interesting read in terms of the “vision,” that the countries had for Antarctica.. mainly to be used as a giant science playground and I think the treaty was put in place to prevent an aggressive resource grab

Let’s use this treaty as the midway point between Robert Falcon Scott traipsing around a then unknown continent, to Lockheed Martin being the lead logistics contractor.. a key component of the Military Industrial Complex. What has happened in this relatively short time frame? Is this treaty a sham?

Well..

If you watch Kevin Shipp (Ex-CIA) state that Leidos Holdings is a key component of the Intelligence Industrial Complex, albeit not technically part of the ""military,"" it contracts many secret projects and is the current logistical contract manager in Antarctica.. interesting...""to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.""

Who are ""Leidos,""?

(See below research from /u/52NUKE)

""more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector""

""In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies""

""The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest""

Military involvement, or at least involvement that is documented to a degree reached a peak during WWII, specifically...after the war was supposedly over.

http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/Operation_Highjump.pdf

Most of you have probably read this, or at least heard about it. It was a massive military operation which ended as a failure.. with quite conflicting information to read about and it 100% has an ""official narrative."" But i'm not interested in that..

Watch this if you haven't, rare Richard E Byrd footage discussing Antarctica - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4

I value interviews with people who have ""lived it,"" and take heed to what, and how they say things. I believe Mr.Byrd is being sincere in his talk of ""land beyond the South Pole, larger than North America."" This is one of the ultimate truths, what lies beyond the South Pole.. what land is he referencing here? What is ""beyond"" the South Pole..? A compelling case for a hollow earth scenario, or at least additional areas of Earth we are not aware of existing.

Why did they have Cryptographic Aides with them? hmm..

This interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, and read in part as follows:

‘“Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The Admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the Admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.”

https://www.flickr.com/photos/peter-schmidt-berlin-zehlendorf/25512339496

The year is 1947. What planes that are hostile.. would be from polar regions? How could they fly over ""one, or both poles."" I have read that transcript many a time, and his behaviour in the video and the comments to El Mercurio are extremely interesting.

So.. how far is pole to pole in our current Earth Model? 12,430 miles. Max range of any WWII-era plane that we know of would barely be over 1,000 miles.

What cohesive force in 1947 had access to both poles? with hostile planes that sent a massive operation PACKING.. (they finished the expedition early and incurred losses)

""Maria Orschitsch, a member of the Vril-Gesellschaft would obtained telepathically messages from extraterrestrials in a code language of the Knights Templar, a language that was unknown to her. ""

What a description.. quite an interesting read. So what does this all mean? There is undoubtedly alot of activity in Antarctica up until this point, with a focus on secrecy and pretty limited information for us to work with.

RELEASE: 01-24-01

In a brief announcement today, NASA and the JPL terminated all further study of Lake Vostok in S. Antarctica. In an apparent slip of confidentiality, spokeswoman Debra Shingteller alluded to ""National Security Issues"" allowing the NSA to assume full control of what had been an International effort to explore a huge, under-ice lake near the Russian Vostok research station.

Ms. Shingteller was immediately led away from the podium, and an aid responded to the many further questions with the same answer: ""the project has been halted due to environmental issues"", and that no further releases were pending. The large crowd of press corp. were left clamoring as the officials left the stage. Ms. Shingteller has not responded to repeated attempts at contact.

The above is a report from an official JPL PR representative who attended the announcement.

[INTRODUCTION:](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4c3lg/wanna_go_down_an_interdimensional_rabbit_hole/)

**The ultimate goal of this project was to obtain a better understanding specifically of the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of the pedophilia which is so inexplicably rampant amongst the highest echelon's of every society in the world.  In the last post we explored the idea of this secret ancient occult knowledge and how it has been passed down amongst the rich and powerful in secrecy since the beginning of civilization. We found out in Part I that this ""secret ancient occult knowledge"" is actually just a Hermetic view of the world that is basically an understanding that the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of reality are not only real, but far more important than the simple material experience which we live everyday. It is no mistake that the term ""occult"" (which literally means secret or hidden) has been so heavily weaponized especially in the US, it is immediately associated with pseudo-scientific lunacy by almost everyone mainly thanks to Hollywood. This is what originally motivated me to begin this project, the mainstream's overt insistency that anything spiritual or metaphysical is to be laughed at was becoming a bit too obvious for me. This, paired with the obvious spiritual obsessions ie (symbolism, rituals etc) of the most powerful people in the world was really bothering me and inspired me to make these posts.**

**SECTION I:** That which is apparent to our five senses is only a fraction of the human experience

.

* ***Before we uncover the ancient roots of this malevolent immaterial force we have to solidify the fact that there is truly a metaphysical aspect to this reality. This is my expanded research on my claims in Part I.***

First we must do a recap on the ancient origins of esoteric and spiritual knowledge. In Part I, we showed that an extremely diluted form of Gnosticism (a strictly metaphysical belief system) influenced each and every one of the mainstream religions practiced today. But what I failed to mention in the last post was the fact that Gnosticism was specifically derived from the Hermetic school of thought which gained popularity in ancient Egypt and is said to have originated far before the earliest of our known history. Hermeticism is said to be passed down from the ancients of the “lost land” and has been regarded as the oldest form of knowledge even amongst the ancient Egyptians who taught it and popularized it. The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions;  this knowledge has been very carefully disseminated amongst the elites of various secret societies for generations upon generations. I recommend reading the first chapter of the Kybalion if you want a full picture of its origins.

\-**So why should we take Hermeticism seriously?**

Here I will show that these unimaginably-ancient Hermetic Principles are constantly being proven in modern science through quantum mechanics

**--Mentalism:** The first Hermetic principle tells us that *“All is mind, the universe is mental.”*

This is now being explained by breakthroughs in quantum gravity, the field devoted to uniting Einstein’s relativity with quantum theory, as due to quantum information processing, which tells us that our spacetime is [an emergent simulation](https://www.academia.edu/456203/Simulating_Space_and_Time). Elsewhere, experiments into the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as tests of the [Leggett inequality,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leggett_inequality) have actually falsified material realism.  Recent discoveries tell us that spacetime emerges specifically from entangled information, the i[nformation generating quantum entanglement](https://www.nature.com/news/the-quantum-source-of-space-time-1.18797), the phenomenon wherein two or more particles affect each other at vast distances at speeds faster than light (Previously regarded as impossible by the Laws of Physics) .

Meanwhile the[Integrated Information Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) of consciousness, or IIT, identifies entangled information as integrated information or consciousness:

*”Quantum entanglement and integrated information, to the extent that one cannot perturb two elements independently,* ***they are informationally one***”

**Putting these two together we see therefore that spacetime emerges from consciousness.**[The universe is after all a mental information construct](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) **inside of some greater consciousness, which is of course the same thing as the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**--Vibration**: The next Hermetic principle ill cover, the Principle of Vibration tells us that: “Nothing rests; Everything moves; Everything vibrates.”

Modern physics exactly parallels this with the wavefunction. According to the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, everything can be defined by a wavefunction that describes a quantum probability wave, which vibrates at a specific frequency.

\--Interestingly, the parallels do not stop there. Other direct parallels specific to both quantum mechanics, as well as even more advanced physics exist. *The Kybalion* states that:

*“if the vibrations be continually increased the object would mount up the successive states of manifestation… until it would finally re-enter The All,”*

**As it turns out, the frequency of an object’s wavefunction is directly proportional to the energy content of the object being described. So the higher the vibration of the object the greater the degree of its mass or energy content, just as described in the quote.**

A discovery regarding the relationship between space and quantum entanglement demonstrated that spacetime behaves as a holistic pattern of entanglement known as a string-net, and that subatomic particles emerge from this string-net. This network of entanglements is of course a field of vibrating quantum waves.

String theory meanwhile tells us something similar. According to string theory matter and space are actually two descriptions of the same thing. This is shown by the fact that spacetime created by matter due to relativity shares the same vibratory frequency as the matter that generated it. The spacetime is merely matter at a different degree of vibration and vice-versa, exactly as explained in the quote.

* ***I will stop these draining and complex examples here but this can be done with almost every one of the main Hermetic principles (check for yourself). How is this possible? How can the most ancient human ideas be explaining quantum theories we are just finding out today? In the next part I will show how the most complicated scientific theories in history have struggled with this problem.***

**--Continuing with Modern scientists struggles with the relation between ancient knowledge and modern quantum theories we have learned in the last century**

&#x200B;

**Werner Heisenberg**:

Quote from [Tao of Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-Exploration-Parallels-Mysticism/dp/1590308352)

“I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then \[circa 1972\], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and **he told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of** **Tagore**\*\*. He talked a lot with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him.\*\* **Niels Bohr** **had a similar experience when he went to China.”**

# 

**Erwin Schrödinger**:

“Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge… It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two ‘I”s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further… when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.

**“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my** **knowledge**\*\*, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition\*\* [**ATMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Atman) **=** [**BRAHMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brahman) **(the personal** **self** **equals the omnipresent,** [**all-comprehending eternal self**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_All)**) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world.**

&#x200B;

**Niels Bohr:**

“For a parallel regarding to the lesson regarding the limited applicability of such customary idealizations, w**e must in fact turn to quite other branches of science, such as psychology, or even to that kind of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like Buddha and Lao Tse have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence**.”

**“** In the psychophysical parallelism, as envisaged by Leibniz and Spinoza, has obtained a wider scope through the development o**f atomic physics, which forces us to an attitude towards the problem of explanation recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.**

**Bohr adopted the yin yang symbol as part of his family coat of arms when he was knighted in 1947.**

**Wolfganf Pauli**\*: He viewed that the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics or quantum physics “gives rise, however, to a situation transcending natural science” that can even acquire a “religious function” in human experience. This is not a belief in the religions of old, but as Pauli states “I do not believe in the possible future of mysticism in the old form.\* ***However, I do believe that the natural sciences will out of themselves bring forth a counter pole in their adherents, which connects to the old mystic elements.”***

**Alber Einstein**: This \[the theories connecting ancient mysticism with modern quantum mechanics\] led to Einstein’s famous attempt at “breaking” quantum physics, the [EPR paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox). At first a thought experiment which appeared to demonstrate quantum physics violating the seemingly well established principle of [locality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality), later experiments showed that quantum physics instead proved locality to be false, therefore collapsing the laws of physics.

Violations of locality and determinism seemed to bother Einstein greatly, and this can be seen in his famous quote objecting to the randomness involved in wave function collapse under Bohr’s interpretation, that “God does not play dice”.

Einstein wrote in his autobiography:

*“All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge (quantum mechanics) have failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.”*

**Keynote**: I am by no means claiming that these scientists have “cracked the code” of ancient mysticism or have indefinitely solidified a scientifically proven connection between these ancient ideologies and modern physics. I am not even saying that these scientists fully believed the point im trying to prove her at all.  But let's just assume for a second that what I am arguing is true, these ancient Hermetic texts have divine origins and are a correct philosophical interpretation of the intertwined physical and metaphysical reality of the universe. If this was the case wouldn't it be safe to predict that the most intelligent minds, attempting to understand the laws of the universe, in modern history would be in a constant intellectual struggle with these ideas throughout their career? Well, know we know that they have been.

**Now let’s look at the physicists behind the CIA and KGB during the Cold War**:

\-- Because of the Cold War, accounts of alleged psychic abilities (extrasensory perception, as in telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, a.k.a. telekinesis, and psychometry) could no longer be ignored by the US and USSR intelligence agencies out of fear of losing a competitive edge. Experiments and tests on people with these abilities were abundant at this time,  thankfully coming along with an overwhelming amount of scientific literature trying to figure out how the hell this was even possible. It soon became obvious that well.. it wasn’t, well at least not within our current laws of physics, we obviously needed to reevaluate our current understanding of physics just like Einstein in that quote. This called for scientists to start taking the theories of quantum mechanics seriously. Quantum mechanics ended up being the first field of study which could offer natural explanations for these phenomena.

\--The significant results of the findings in the document [ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF GATEWAY PROCESS,](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) showed that **the only way to naturally explain this kind of paranormal/esoteric phenomena, scientists view the universe through the Holographic Universe Theory.**

***We know from the last post that there is as much evidence behind the holographic universe theory as*** [there is behind the current big bang theory,](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm) ***I elaborated on this in Part 1.***

\--There becomes a point where, both physicists and us a society, have to be either all in on this holographic theory of the universe or just discredit it altogether. There simply is no other way to explain the paranormal phenomena which people around the world are conducting. The problem with going “all in” with this theory is that it tears down everything that we know, again just like we saw Einstein stressing in his quote.

This is best exemplified in [a CIA document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82-00039R000100230012-3.pdf) showing a Soviet Scientist, tasked with constructing a quantum theory of reality. He states:

*“The repeated attempt to construct a quantum theory of field..* ***that would not be purley illusory and in which it would not be necessary to physically absurd consequences***\*, have not been met with success”\*

Read [The Paraphysics Warsaw Pact](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100020010-5.pdf) to see how real paranormal abilities are

&#x200B;

**SECTION II:** What exactly am I looking for?

&#x200B;

* ***Now that I have laid out my expanded argument for the reality of the metaphysical/spiritual nature of the universe, It is time to tie back in to the ultimate goal of this project.***

To tie back into Part I, we must understand that all of those in power have a complete and total understanding of the Hermetic spiritual nature of the universe which they have actively and purposely hidden from the masses over generations. Those in power have used this spiritual/metaphysical knowledge to their advantage in order to maintain ultimate and total dominance over the world and its inhabitants.

**So where does the evil that embodies these elite tie in?**:

Going back to Robert Bernard; [here he explains](https://youtu.be/VA3BDYpkDbo?t=2818) how spirituality came into play during his time as a top player in this international crime syndicate:

“Then you start to discover that there is much more than what I call the 4 dimensions, you have length, width, height, and time… but then you start to discover that we are the cross point of multi-dimensions and frequencies.. You start to sense that there is really something going on in the other frequencies and dimensions and then **you start also to know that there are low frequency beings, what we call now the fallen angels or the Djinn, who are really serving a sort of master… a dark manifestation entity known as Lucifer… We really have to face the fact that besides the 4 dimensions we have this interaction with other intellects, other beings.. And the ones I was serving (negative manifestation Lucifer) was real- it was not a joke, including the sacrifice of children everything was real.**

**I also came across a reference to these evil entities in the book** [*The Vatican Exposed*](https://archive.org/details/vaticanexposed00paul/page/6)

*“The scoundrels we study remain even to this day some of the most accomplished* ***matter deceivers*** *in western history. The fraud and masquerade we encounter in these pages is not only a product of a particular conspiracy or cabal it is older than the pyramids and of institutional character.* ***They are two-faced operators, for whom double-thinking and double-dealing are second nature..to an immensity greater than we can imagine. We are in the presence of the servants of an intelligence almost without limit; and second only to God”***

&#x200B;

**Once again an immaterial evil force was mentioned by the Vatican’s top exorcist** [Father Gabriel Amorth:](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2010/03/11/vatican_exorcist/)

According to The Times, Amorth blames ""cardinals who do not believe in Jesus, **and bishops who are linked to the Demon"".**

Father Gabriele Amorth, who according to The Times is president of honour of the Association of Exorcists, said the Vatican's current problems - including **recurrent child abuse allegations and a brewing gay prostitution scandal - can be largely attributed to Lucifer's visitation at the Vatican.**

&#x200B;

**Main Point:** What the fuck are all these different sources talking about? I was so goddamn lost at this point in my research but at the same time absolutely positive(my opinion) that these consistent allusions to this immaterial force, couldn't just all be bullshit, there is an active evil presence playing out malevolent events in our world to serve a higher spiritual being and I was not going to stop until I found out what it was.

&#x200B;

**Section III**: The ancient descriptions of this immaterial force

&#x200B;

* ***My search for information regarding these malevolent beings started with the ancient accounts of these forces in various ancient cultures. Here is what I came up with:***

Like with most of this project I will start with the most ancient description I can find which, again, is the Gnostics, this is how they describe these malevolent spiritual forces which they call Archons:

**Archons:**

\-They are ***cyborgs*** inhabiting the planetary system (exclusive of the earth, sun and moon), which is \*\*described as a virtual world (\*\**stereoma*) they construct by imitating the geometric forms emanated from the *Pleroma*, the realm of the Generators, the Cosmic Gods.

\-Archons are said to feel **intense envy toward humanity** because we possess the intentionality they lack

\-Have no empathy, **feed off of negative emotions, have no creative ability**

\-Archons are an alien force that **intrudes subliminally upon the human mind and deviates our intelligence** away from its proper and sane applications.

\-Archons are ***psycho-spiritual parasites***\*\*.\*\*

\-The risk they pose by invading our mental software is far greater than any physical risk they might pose by erratically breaching the biosphere.

\-Because the **Archons need human complicity to gain power** **over humankind, any one who assists them can be considered a kind of Archon, an accessory.**

\-Working through **telepathy and suggestion**, the Archons attempt to **deviate us from our proper course of evolution.** Their most successful technique is to use religious ideology to insinuate their way of thinking and, in effect, substitute their mind-set for ours.

**Keynote**: to quickly summarize here, an Archon is a **parasitic,** **cyborg, alien/foreign intruder.** They are **envious** of certain human traits, attach to hosts, and have **telepathic** powers at their dispense. Really think about the meaning of these ideas, especially the bold terms, before moving on to the next section.

&#x200B;

* ***Now we are going to take a look at various ancient religions from different time periods and cultures and read their descriptions of this immaterial evil force. Keep your eyes out for the similarities!***

\--**Quran-Djinn**(specifically referenced by Ronald Bernard): Djinn are capable of possessing human beings. They are said to enter the bloodstream and circulate rapidly through the body. They cause mental and physical problems, and also disrupt marriages and relationships. Asking a Djinn to leave, or bargaining with it, may not be enough to get it to go, and someone who is trained may be needed to perform an exorcism to get it out of the body.

According to Islamic writings, Djinn live alongside other creatures but form a world other than that of mankind. Though they see us they cannot be seen. Characteristics they share with human beings are intellect and freedom to choose between right and wrong and between good and bad, but according to the Qur'an their origin is different from that of man

&#x200B;

\-- ***Mesopotamian Toltec-The Allies***: . The Allies lack a brain, **which means they have no factory to create emotions**, but they need the **ethereal energy of emotions to sustain their life. Allies push humans to create traumas in order to create fear, which they feed upon.”**

The Allies must then **convert emotion into the negative emotion on which they feed**. He explained that the Allies had no mechanism to produce the negative emotional energy themselves. They had to turn human emotional energy into negative energy before they could harvest it. In order to turn human emotion negative, the Allies are **capable of putting fearful thoughts into the minds of humans which in turn generates the negative emotion on which they feed.** *These entities are attracted to negative emotional energy much as sharks are to blood.*

&#x200B;

***--Wetiko-Native Americans***:  Wetiko is an Algonquin word for a **cannibalistic spirit that is driven by greed, excess, and selfish consumption** (in Ojibwa it is *windigo, wintiko* in Powhatan). It deludes its host into **believing that cannibalizing the life-force of others (others in the broad sense, including animals and other forms of life) is a logical and morally upright way to live**.

*-Wetiko* **short-circuits the individual’s ability to see itself** as an enmeshed and interdependent part of a balanced environment and **raises the self-serving ego to supremacy.** It is this false separation of self from nature that makes this cannibalism, rather than simple murder.

*-Wetiko* can **describe both the infection and the body infected;** a person can be infected by *wetiko* or, in cases where the infection is very advanced, can personify the disease: ‘*a wetiko*.’ This holds true for cultures and systems; all can be described as being *wetiko* if they routinely manifest these traits.

&#x200B;

***--Chitauri - Ancient African:*** \-The **Chitauri** are an evil extraterrestrial race of shape-shifting humanoids

\- We are told the **Chitauri feed on the energy that we give them**. They **make us fight against each other, and when the whole world is drowning in death, fear, and terror,** the Chitauri get f**ed by the dark power which is brought out when humans destroy the planet on which they live**. **They are fed when human minds think at certain levels. We are told they want us to think at certain levels and they reward us with long lives.**

\-**-E’epa-Hawai**i: The e'epa are mental forces that have the ability to **intrude into the human mind.** They operate through subterfuge and psychic stealth.

T**hey are adversaries who are drawn to humans because they wish to acquire our human capacity for creative imagination**. Humans are creators, and they are not. Because of this, the deceivers will always be thwarted by the superiority of our human species.""

&#x200B;

***--Bible-Demons:*** *Demons have the* ***ability to possess people***\*. These fallen angels are what the Bible refers to as demons.\* ***Demons are able to take shape, form and be visible to humans*** *(Job 4:15). Demons may be exercised, or driven out, from a possessed person. However, this may be dangerous if not followed by stringent cleaning and discipleship. Without proper spiritual care, the person might then be open for a seven-fold infestation (Matthew 12:45).*

***Demons confuse the truth by utilizing demonic lies and half-truths*** *(1 John 4:4).Those who* ***worship idols and pagan gods are really worshipping and sacrificing to demons.*** *D****emons live to deceive people into worshipping themselves*** *(1 Corinthians 10:20-21). The Bible teaches that demons can inhabit animals and people (Matthew 8:31)*

\--**Zuswazi Africa-Zulu**:

And, it is further said that these Zuswazi, these Imbulu, or whatever you choose to call them, are not capable of eating solid food. T**hey either eat human blood, or they eat that power, the energy that is generated when human beings, on the surface of the Earth, are fighting and killing each other in large numbers.**

**Main point**: How is it possible that all of these cultures from all over the world from entirely different time periods are describing the same force with the same characteristics? There has got to be some reality to this, something more than simply primitive fairytale like we are taught. So I researched…

&#x200B;

**Section IV**: Modern Descriptions of this evil inter-dimensional force

* \---By this point I knew I was on to something, I used these descriptions to search for other accounts of these forces. The first similar and reliable I came across was the work of gifted Austrian Philosopher [Rudolph Steiner(1861-1925)](https://exonews.org/rudolf-steiner-describes-the-hostile-spiritual-beings-who-feed-off-of-your-fear-and-anxiety/)who was a stand philosopher and academic of his time. Steiner states:

“ *There are beings in the spiritual realms for* ***whom anxiety and fear emanating from human beings offer welcome food. When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creatures starve.****” declared Steiner. “****These beings are hostile towards humanity …and they become more and more powerful (from this negative human energy nutrition) …launching cruel attacks on human beings.****”*

*“Therefore,” says Steiner, “it is above all necessary… that the person who enters the spiritual world overcomes fear, feelings of helplessness, despair and anxiety.* ***These are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary culture and materialism because it estranges people from the spiritual world… to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in people,*** *thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.***”**

&#x200B;

This wasn't enough for me, I needed some scientific backing, after seaching long and hard I came across [this psychology study in the CIA FOIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000700760002-6.pdf)vault by clinical psychologist Juilka Kiskos and Andree Samuel

&#x200B;

**The Abstract Reads**:

*“Clinical Psychology has not taken into account evidence provided by other areas of research that point to the* ***existence of other levels of reality.*** *Therefore, that which is not perceived  through physical senses is often considered as being of a paranormal nature.* ***The authors have observed that in some psychological disorders sometimes there is an ESP factor mingled with the symptoms, and which are only taken into account as a proof of  ""insanity***"".

\-The entire study is dedicated to drawing a distinction between what doctors deem as “insanity” from actual clairvoyance experiences. The specific type of “insanity” we are going to cover for our purpose is the schizophrenia/”voices in your head” part of the study. These psychologists would employ “sensitives” or people with ESP to try and interact with these “voices” in some way. They turned out to be extremely successful and seemingly were performing ground breaking science that, unsurprisingly, we never heard about...

**Here are some direct quotes from the study**:

“*During the treatment of certain patients,* ***we came across extraneous personalities***\*. These were named “Theta Agents” because the circumstances in which they manifest themselves led us to conclude they were deceased persons.”\*

*“As a working hypothesis,* ***we consider that these entities exist in another level of reality or structure of their personality***\*, enabling us to understand and(page cuts off)”

**-There are 4 different groups of Theta Agents that they categorized. Only one of them matched up to the description consistently allotted to us by these ancient cultures previously mentioned.**

Category 3: “**Theta Agents induced to harm patients by means of black magic”**

[https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png](https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png)

***Now we are starting to get somewhere, The next place I looked for evidence turned out to be the more obvious one, with a lot more first hand accounts and expert testimonies… demonic possessions, which I previously believed were fiction.***

\-What many religions have called “demon/djinn/e’epa/etc. possessions” actually turns out to be a very similar if not identical condition as the malevolent “theta agent” described above.

**There is undoubtedly a demand for the services of Exorcists which has been legitimized by the Vatican**:

“In 1990, Father Amorth and five other officially appointed exorcists founded the International Association of Exorcists.By 2010, the organization numbered around 300 members from around the world, and although it was founded as an informal organization, the **Roman Catholic Church officially approved its statute in 2014**.”

\--**Father Gabriel Amorth did an** [exclusive interview on this topic](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/interview-with-an-exorcist--the-devil-and-father-amorth-69777) **which he required to be released only after he died, here are the highlights**:

**Q**: Can you contact these entities, what do they say?

**A**: ""Yes, through the patient, but in a strange, unnatural voice. If it is the Devil himself, he says 'I am Satan, or Lucifer, or Beelzebub. We ask if he is alone or if there are others with him. We ask when and how they entered that particular body. **We find out whether their presence is due to a spell and the specifics of that spell.**

**Q:** How do people come to be possessed by demons in the first place?

**A:** ""I believe God sometimes singles out certain souls for a special test of spiritual endurance, **but more often people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with black magic. Some are entrapped by a satanic cult. Others are the victims of a curse.""**

\--If you do not want to take the word of someone with religious presuppositions and biases I completely understand, neither did I. So here are the highlights from a [Washington Post interview with Richard Gallagher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/), a board-certified psychiatrist and a professor of clinical psychiatry at New York Medical College (studied psychology at Princeton, Yale, and Columbia) Here is what he had to say:

&#x200B;

""*As a man of reason, I’ve had to rationalize the seemingly irrational. Questions about how a scientifically trained physician can believe “such outdated and unscientific nonsense,” as I’ve been asked, have a simple answer*\*\*\*. I honestly weigh the evidence. I have been told simplistically that levitation defies the laws of gravity, and, well, of course it does! We are not dealing here with purely material reality, but with the spiritual realm. One cannot force these creatures to undergo lab studies or submit to scientific manipulation; they will also hardly allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment, as skeptics sometimes demand. *(The official Catholic Catechism* [*holds*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm) *t****hat demons are sentient and possess their own wills***\*; as\* ***they are fallen angels, they are also craftier than humans. That’s how they sow confusion and seed doubt, after all.****)""*

""*But I believe I’ve seen the real thing. Assaults upon individuals are classified either as “demonic possessions” or as the slightly more common but less intense attacks usually called “oppressions.”* ***A possessed individual may suddenly, in a type of trance, voice statements of astonishing venom and contempt for religion, while understanding and speaking various foreign languages previously unknown to them. The subject might also exhibit enormous strength or even the extraordinarily rare phenomenon of levitation***\*. (I have not witnessed a levitation myself, but half a dozen people I work with vow that they’ve seen it in the course of their exorcisms.)\* ***He or she might demonstrate “hidden knowledge” of all sorts of things*** *— like how a stranger’s loved ones died, what secret sins she has committed, even where people are at a given moment. These are skills that cannot be explained except by special psychic or preternatural ability.*“

&#x200B;

* **While these expert accounts are extremely significant in their entirety, In order to keep this project moving forward in the direction I wanted, I focused on a specific aspect of these pieces of evidence: dark magic, spells, and devil worship.**

\---These mentions of dark occult practices seemed to be exactly the connection I was looking for to explain the evil nature of this international-mafia. They purposely create wars, disease, child killings/raping, because these are the greatest sources of the dark and negative emotions/energy that they feed off of. I will list the mentions of dark magic and occults below from the previous three sources:

&#x200B;

**CIA Psychology study**: “Theta Agents induced to harm patients by **means of black magic”**

**Father Gabriel Amorth:** “ people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with **black magic**. Some are entrapped by a **satanic cult**. Others are the **victims of a curse**.""

**Richard Gallaghe**r: “In the late 1980s, I was introduced to a self-styled **Satanic high priestess**.. In our many discussions, she acknowledged worshipping Satan as her “queen.” **She could tell some people their secret weaknesses, such as undue pride. She knew how individuals she’d never known had died, including my mother and her fatal case of ovarian cancer. Six people later vouched to me that, during her exorcisms, they heard her speaking multiple languages, including Latin, completely unfamiliar to her outside of her trances.**

**Keynote**: The simple yet significant conclusion that can be drawn from these excerpts is the fact that these malevolent spiritual entities are not entirely random and out of control, **there exists people and groups with the spiritual capabilities/knowledge to wield these negative forces for personal gain.**

* ***What other motivation could there be for all of this unnecessary suffering created by these people? Like of course you could say 9/11 and military conflicts were created for the financial and power gains, you could say that the globally organized and universally protected sex trafficking of children is just because these people simply enjoy the thrill of abusing and molesting children, or the suppression of  world changing technology( e.g.Tesla free-energy) and cures for diseases is to prop up a future of their continual reign over the earth, etc. but thats not a good enough explanation for me at this point.  There are plenty of other ways for these people to go about their business while continue to control the world but there is a direct link between the agenda of these people and maximum suffering and pain. What else can explain these people’s obsession with symbolism and ritualistic behavior? What else can explain the Luciferian churches and celebrations that Ronald Bernard alluded to and I talked about in part I?***

\--Take this quote from life-long clairvoyant [Anton Steiger](https://www.antonstyger.ch/index.php/en/about-myself) an outspoken advocate for the metaphysical realm and esoteric nature of our existence:

*“When I see people in business or politics who are particularly trapped by the material world, for example, I notice that they no longer have any light bodies at all. In many of these people, the point of light at the heart chakra, which is otherwise always present, is no longer visible to me. Instead, I see something like a layer of ‘shiny tar’ around them in which a monstrous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished. When such people speak on television, for example, I see a crocodile shape manifesting itself around the person like in a concave mirror; I don’t see the light of their throat and forehead chakra.”*

&#x200B;

There is something different about these people, something inhuman, something immaterial. It’s time to wake up and realize that the material world is just a fraction of what we are meant to experience as humans. These elite fully understand this but use/hide this knowledge to serve the dark manifestations of spirituality through material control over every aspect of this world

There's 24 pictures of Antarctica in WIKILEAKS.  
Why the fuck would Julian attach pictures of ice and penguins?? There is something in Antarctica that Julian wants us to know about? There might be messages hidden in these pictures. I think that was what phase 3 was gonna be about.

On oct 28 all the counties that have rights to Antarctica signed a treaty banning fishing in Antarctica for the next 35 years.They say we are trying to save the Chilean sea bass. I call bullshit. I think this is to keep traffic down to a minimum.

Where was he the 3 days in between US and NZ?? 

U.K. US and Russia are they key countries heavily into expeditions in Antarctica. A week ago Russia drilled 2 miles into the ice hitting a underground body of water. The scientist dropped in the hole to inspect and ended up getting killed by a giant 12 legged octopus.

I didn't check DNCleaks 

Everyone was worried about searching for PIZZAGATE and overlooked this. Pizza gate is just a small piece of the BIGGER picture!!! If you use twitter, add on to your hashtags #pizzagate #AlienGate 

Germany was the first country that was interested in Antarctica. Hitler's theory was the earth was hollow and the poles at the end of the earth were the entrance into the center. He said the bloodline elites lived in there (fallen angels or theory is they are reptilian) Hitler was so interested in what was there that he CONTINUED his expedition while WW2 was going on.

There is something there!!!! Julian was trying to tell us by alll the pictures in the leaks. My anon friend said Julian worked out a deal with the CIA and world govts to leak out certain emails to control the minds of the population. If this is true, then Julian would have to communicate with us thru hidden code. So, when searching in WL we need to look for code language. 

First off let me say... Cloning is real, all governments do it. The elites have been pre conditioning us about cloning for a LONG time. 
There's been many cloning movies that give us clues. The freemasonry symbol is identical to the movie Avatar. Which is about cloning humans and aliens
[Avatar and Masonry ](https://sli.mg/xemLLt)

 [Britney Spears Cloning center music video ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFIKP9rGhQ) 

the Simpsons have episode on cloning
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HLITQXRH70M

Here's an example of a Britney Spears clone. Looks nothing like her. She posted this on her twitter. 
 [clone ](https://sli.mg/5eZSU5) 

Here is info from a guy named Don Marshall, he said he's been to the cloning centers and tells all. He can easily be a puppet of the illuminati but he's giving us this info for A REASON. To condition the public...
[don Marshall ](http://donaldmarshallrevolution.com)

George Green was an insider and he tells us about how the elites are cloning and have contact with aliens. 
He said they used to hologram, but now they can clone a walking talking real life person since 2008. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PIKUslVwbs
I think the above two people are puppets but are part of the ""pre conditioning"" the public for what is to come. 

Also, Phillip Schneider worked for the govt building underground bunkers. He said there were 300 + in the US and mentioned Antarctica too. He said the govt budget for this type SHIT is half a trillion. Each bunker cost $17 billion and takes about 2 years to build. The govt averages 3 a year. He also says there is underground railroads the connect all the bunkers which blows the technology we have out of the water. Their technology and roadways make us look ancient. I think this is why trump says our roadways are 3rd world bc he prob knows what type of high tech stuff they have underground. There was a video he posted of the underground bunkers (I think) but it looks like it's been deleted. Phillip also told us there were grey aliens living underground too and he saw them with his own eyes. He said we make deals with them for exchange of tech/energy, so this could be where some of our kids are going. Phillip says 100,000 kids go missing per year, not counted for. Not kidnap but just disappeared.  After he gave this speech he was murdered!!!!

Max spiers is a UFO specialist and researcher. He was also researching the Clinton's as well. Well, he found out too much info and he was murdered too. 
http://www.inquisitr.com/3611766/ufo-expert-max-spiers-fiance/
Why is our govt killing off these UFO experts and witnesses?? 

This is a great article!!!!! Must read

Also, you need to remember the Pope met with Patriarch Kirill of Moscow earlier this year, something that hasn't happened in 1000 years, and he told Krill the end is near. At the same time Putin moved The Ark of Gabriel (Has very bad energy) from the middle east  to Antartica. What stuns me about this is, Im reading a book right now called the Islamic Anti-christ. In the  Quran their Messiah is our Anti-christ in our bible. Is the Arc of Gabriel a way to welcome the demons and antichrist on our land?

Ok, Now the mystery of Julian disappearance:
So, if it's true that Julian worked for the CIA and wanted help he would have to send messages to us thru code the hidden code in the wiki misspelled tweets spells out HELP HIM. Why did he send that in code? Bc  someone was watching over him even before he was captured on Oct 17?
. [HELP HIM ](https://sli.mg/DBvByu) 

The US govt been trying to get their hands on Julian for a long time. For what? To maybe clone him? If so they would have to plan this out in great lengths. For years the US has been destroying the Ecuador economy [here ](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Meet-the-Banker-Brothers-Who-Destroyed-Ecuadors-Economy-20160613-0025.html) 
The elites KNOW they get their way if they bribe you. So, they destroy Ecuador economy then bribe Ecuador to give up Julian for cash to rebuild their country. 
The Don Marshall website posted above explains the different types of clones the govt is involved with. He also explains the clones take 5 months to fully grow. I find it really fkin weird that Julian's next appearance is Feb 19. That's 4 months and 3 days after he went missing on Oct. 17 
Could it be possible the US bribed Ecuador in exchange for Julian to clone him?? He is worth more ALIVE bc the public doesn't trust mainstream media. There trust is in WIKILEAKS but majority of the people don't  trust WL without Julian being in charge. WL will fail if Julian is killed. Then the elites won't  have a platform to use to control our minds... MSM fail, WL fail if he's dead. They can't just release him bc he will rebel and run. The elites NEED Julian more then ever especially after Trump won and is threatening to drain the swamp.  They need WL to help spread their propaganda. 

PROOF CIA IS RUNNING WL :One of the WIKILEAKS associates told us NSA and CIA are at war. NSA being the good guys. So, WL the other day RELEASES NSA Germany leaks. Like fkin kidding me? They are fkin stupid. WL is obviously ran by CIA right now bc they are taking jabs at NSA using merkels leaks who is caught throwing up NWO gang signs [here ](https://sli.mg/lHE8wf) 
A lot of people say this 4chan post is fake but I feel like it has some truth to it. That's how CIA works. They feed us truth with dis info. [NSA VS CIA ](https://sli.mg/uwE69h) 

So, having said all that... Its a lot to take in especially with all that has been revealed in the last 3 months. Antartica has to be where the Aliens are located and experiments, such as breeding and cloning etc. go on. In the last 2 years Millionaires are FLOCKING to New Zealand (near Antartica) and underground bunkers are in high demand right now. The elites are preparing for doomsday.

 http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/09/28/demand-luxury-bunkers-soars-among-fearful-l-elites/

 We recently found out about pizzagate, which is extremely evil and sickening! Its a huge global pedo ring that involves all the world leaders, politicians, bankers, judges, FBI, CIA, and Hollywood and now... Aliens. WTF  This could explain the reason behind kids vanishing. Last week Turkey went nuts blowing up #pizzagate asking where their 9,000 children went. 9,000 refugees were suppose to go to Germany... but they DISAPPEARED! Yeah, put those dots together!! You can't give them cash bc wth they gonna do with it? lol Shit is barley worth anything up here in the real world. 
So, I think we all need to come together and research every end and demand answers:
1. Pedo Sex Ring/ Satanic Ritual Murders--> Research location of disappearance of kids  (Example: Watch Phillip Schneider video (above) and write down where all the underground bunkers are. Theres a HUGE one under Denver airport. Maybe theres connections around that airport like the Haiti borders place across from Besta Pizza?  Tunnels under comet that lead to the ETs? #Pizzagate 
2. The ET and Antartica, Who's all connected and I think the Pope calls the shots lol Who's visited Antartica, how often? Secret meetings? Global warming is BS i think so meeting on global warming could actually be about the ETs?  #AlienGate 
3. Julian can either be dead or they are cloning him but we need to stay on their ass about POL #WhereisJulian
4. Go to church, Pray, stay stocked up with food, water and ammo... AND STAY AWAKE and PREPARED.. We are definitely living in the end times #Godspeed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2EjKYMCeg

---------------------------------

On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry (self admitted Skull and Bones member) visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.

For over four years, the Ecuadorian embassy has been under surveillance and Julian's human rights violated as he has been unlawfully detained termed ""illegal arbitrary detention"" by a recent UN ruling. During that time, it has been possible for intelligence agencies to gather critical information and build a detailed profile and plan to circumvent Julian's dead man's switch.

Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies know perfectly well that cutting off Julian's internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that are damaging to Hillary's campaign. It has been very clear for a long time that
many US officials wanted Julian Assange dead, Hillary Clinton even has remarked, ""can't we just drone the guy"". 

The cutting off of Julian's internet access was not for the purpose of preventing the leaks of the Podesta and Hillary emails. Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they know that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also know WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian's ability to communicate.

Removing Assange would not be enough, they would need to circumvent his dead man's switch and then tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Removing Assange's internet could have the effect of causing Assange
to take steps that can be followed to prevent the automatic triggering of his DMS. 

From the day Julian's internet was cut off, a series of peculiar and uncharacteristic events started to take place. The same day that Julian's internet was cut off, CBS reported that Pamela Anderson visited Assange and had ""Tortured"" him with a vegan sandwich. A few days before on the 14th, John Podesta tweeted ""I bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy"". Then on October the 16th the SHA-256 prerelease keys were issued on WikiLeaks twitter feed, although these events are odd and seemingly inconsequential, combined with John Kerry being in the UK from the 16th to the 17th sparked concern among the community for Julian's safety.

Assange supporters started to gather at the embassy to keep Assange safe and witness any foul play, some of these witnesses have claimed that a very swift police armed raid took place that lasted only 5 minutes while the crowd was kept under control and prevented from approaching, there have also been reports that they were prevented from taking photographs and that their phones were confiscated. A live periscope feed was also cut off. There have also been some reports of the presence of a mobile jamming van.

If Assange has been seized, any recognition by mainstream media would be detrimental to Hillary's campaign. A covert operation with media blackout would be the only effective way of seizing him at this time. On October the 18th Fox News said that Julian Assange would be ""arrested soon, maybe in a matter of hours."". The was video was then promptly removed and articles relating to it have disappeared. However, one reddit user was able to find an alternative source and now the video can be found again on YouTube.

Although Julian's primary DMS (the release of insurance file encryption keys) did not activate, on October the 18th one of Julian's contingencies did activate, a script was activated that made https://file.wikileaks.org/file publicly visible and set all the file date and time stamps to 01/01/1984 (Orwell reference). This file repository contains many documents that had not been released prior. 


Staffers Kristinn Hrafnsson and Sarah Harrison, have gone silent while the Ecuadorian embassy is refusing to provide any updates on Assange’s fate. There is a recorded call made to the embassy by a journalist where the receptionist refused to confirm that Julian was at the embassy, she also refused to confirm that Julian was even alive. Julian has not made an appearance at the window of the embassy since being cut off.

WikiLeaks suggested in a tweet that its supporters were responsible for the DDOS attacks on the 21st. Neither Assange or WikiLeaks would ever insinuate such a thing. WikiLeaks deceptively tweeted a video of Michael Moore that was actually recorded in June. The video was posted on the 24th of October giving the impression that Michael Moore had been speaking with Assange in the embassy. Why would WikiLeaks do this when they know they are already under suspicion?

WikiLeaks have been using their Twitter account to give the appearance of his safety while providing no concrete evidence of his safety. They issued a poll asking what proof would satisfy the public that Julian was safe. WikiLeaks have yet to follow up on the conclusive result of a video or window appearance.

Julian Assange is known for his attention to detail and his consistently good spelling and grammar. Currently the twitter feed has very poor spelling, there are numerous uncharacteristic spelling errors, for example, an accomplished cryptographer knows how to correctly spell algorithm and so do WikiLeaks staff.

On the 21st of October, there was a massive widespread DDOS attack that disrupted US and EU internet. Also on the 21st of October London City Airport was evacuated. The next day (the 22nd), Gavin MacFayden is reported dead. WikiLeaks made a further blunder by stating his death as the 23rd.

There has been a number of high level WikiLeaks deaths recently too. John Jones QC - WikiLeaks U.N. lawyer died on April 16th 2016. Michael Ratner - WikiLeaks chief counsel died on May 11th 2016. Seth Rich - Employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was fatally shot on July 10th 2016 and Gavin MacFadyen - WikiLeaks director died October 22nd 2016.

If WikiLeaks has been compromised, it is already preparing the scene for future discrepancy to seriously tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Nothing WikiLeaks has shared since the 15th of October 2016 should be trusted until Julian has been fully verified as alive.

My speculative fears are that Julian has been seized and removed from the Embassy. His internet being cut not being related to the release of the emails, but rather as a component of a plan of 4 years in the making to as secretly as possible remove Assange from the embassy, circumvent his DMS and hijack WikiLeaks with the key team members silenced or under duress.

My fears would be confirmed by no future public (mass witnessing and recorded/televised) appearance of Julian Assange discussing recent topics. His death by whatever means after the US presidential election would be extremely suspect. Until proof of life, assume the following compromised:

SHA-256 verification Keys posted after the 15th. 
WikiLeaks submission process and/or platform.
WikiLeaks twitter feed.
Any WikiLeaks leaks after the 15th October 2016.

EDIT: Update 16/12/2016

Why demanding proof that WikiLeaks is not compromised is necessary:

1) Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks.
2) RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)
3) Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised
4) The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files
5) Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning. No one actually saw Julian through the whole process.

Various timelines, some with minor errors: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/WikileaksTimeline/wiki/index https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5dmr57/timeline_of_events_regarding_julian_assange_and/ https://regated.com/2016/11/julian-assange-missing/

[Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks]
Watch this https://youtu.be/GSIDS_lvRv4 video for a simple and good explanation of public/private key cryptography. Here https://riseup.net/en/canary is an example of how a legitimate cryptographically capable organisation uses PGP to sign a message and prove authenticity. WikiLeaks has this setup too. Why do they not use it and prove they are not compromised?

WikiLeaks could easily do this. They have their private key. The public has WikiLeaks public key. Even if Julian isn’t in possession of the key, WL most certainly is, no excuse for WL not to prove themselves. This has been heavily requested of WikiLeaks. I’d like to hear from the individuals who claim that their requests were removed (please leave comments). Of all the red flags, not posting a PGP signed message is by far the most damming.
If we are to believe that the person in the audio recording at the FCM 2016 is Julian Assange, then what he says about the keys is missing the point. If he himself is not in possession of the key, then WikiLeaks will be. If WikiLeaks use the key to prove themselves, then we know they are not compromised. By extension, we will also be assured that Julian is safe as an uncompromised WikiLeaks would be in a position to confirm his safety and be believed. This audio file includes everything that he says regarding PGP keys: http://picosong.com/UyVw/ (I am not convinced this is Julian).

[RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)]
RiseUp is an activist ISP providing secure services to activists. Its mission is to support liberatory social change via fighting social control and mass surveillance through distribution of secure tools (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseup).
RiseUp use a warrant canary as a means to protect their users in case RiseUp are ever issued with a NSL or gag order etc (https://riseup.net/en/canary). This is renewed quarterly, assuming no warrant has been issued. However, this is now considerably overdue so the assumption is that the canary is dead, and just like the canaries used in coal mines, everyone should get the hell out of there when it dies. https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/something-happened-to-activist-email-provider-riseup-but-it-hasnt-been-compromised/. I would be grateful if someone could provide a source for the WikiLeaks twitter email account being hosted by RiseUp.

[Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised]
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088 https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788099178832420865 On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian Embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.

Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies knew perfectly well that cutting off Julian's internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that were damaging to Hillary's campaign.
The cutting off of Julian's internet access was not for the purpose of preventing the leaks of the Podesta and Hillary emails. Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they knew that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also knew WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian's ability to communicate.

Now it is long after the election and Ecuador have still not restored Julian’s internet. Ecuador have no grounds to continue to restrict Julian’s internet. It does nothing apart from increase tensions and raise suspicion.
Ecuador have always been supportive of Julian. However, after John Kerry applied pressure on Ecuador, that whole dynamic changed. Ecuador cut Julian's Internet. He then essentially threatened Ecuador, the UK and John Kerry by submitting those pre-commitment file hashes on Twitter. Since then we have only seen hostility towards Julian from all three parties. Ecuador didn't restore his internet and didn't let his lawyer interview him and no one actually saw him. The U.K. Denied him access to Gavin's funeral and denied him access to medical treatment. The UK also continually disregard the UN. The dynamic now is totally different. He has no political friends. It seems that both the UK and Ecuador are now working against Julian and Wikileaks. An environment where a collaborated siege would be feasible.

Finally, many have speculated about mobile signals being blocked at the Embassy. I can confirm that there is 4G signal right outside the Embassy door. I was there, with my phone, and tested it. There is no reason to think Julian cannot use a MiFi device (or similar) connected to a cellular network.

[The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files]
Here are the October tweets with the file hashes:

https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781046519693316
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781519951720449

These 3 pre-commitment Twitter posts are SHA-256 file hashes. SHA-256 file hashes are 64 characters long. They are not encryption keys for insurance files. They simply are a mathematical formula for verifying that later released files are genuine and have not been altered.

These hashes were released because Julian felt threatened and in increased danger. They specifically targeted the UK FCO, Ecuador and John Kerry. All of whom are key players in his current predicament.
On November 7th, WikiLeaks released 3 new insurance files. These files names match the names given in the pre-commitment hash tweets:

2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_EC.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_UK.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_US.aes256

EC = Ecuador, UK = UK FCO, US = John Kerry. Soon after these files were released, the 3 files hashes were compared to the 3 hashes posted on the 16th of October. They did not match. When this was brought to WikiLeaks attention, WikiLeaks released the following statement in a tweet:
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521

“NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.”

This firstly proved that the hashes and the insurance files were related (a fact that was already clear). Secondly, it was a lie, as it implied historical use of pre-commitment hashes in this manner. Thirdly, the (obviously) comment was also a deception and an insult to supporters. It was not obvious to anyone, not even to our crypto guys in /r/cryptography/, on the contrary, they thought it highly suspicious.
Additionally, what they suggest would be absolutely pointless. Pointless as a threat, as the UK, Ecuador and John Kerry would have no practical way of identifying the documents to confirm the threat.
There's absolutely no scenario where an uncompromised WikiLeaks would either post bad file hashes or altered insurance files.

[Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning]
This is highly unusual and very suspicious. Also, Jennifer Robinson was not in the room with Assange. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&feature=youtu.be&t=9m55s and neither was the chief prosecutor http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37972528 “Swedish chief prosecutor Ingrid Isgren will not speak to Mr Assange directly”.

[UK disregard for international law]
The UK threat is very real. Back in August 2012 the UK was poised to break international law citing the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act of 1987 as a basis for entering the Embassy and arresting Assange (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19259623). It all became very public, very quickly and fortunately never happened (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/ecuador/9488996/Ecuadors-president-raiding-embassy-to-snatch-Julian-Assange-suicidal.html). I expressed my concern at the time that the UK shouldn’t have even been contemplating such action, let alone threatening it in writing to Ecuador.
More recently, the UK disregarded the UN ruling that Julian Assange was being arbitrarily detained (https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/julian-assange-wikileaks-arrest-friday-un-investigation). The UK appealed, and then finally lost their appeal in November (https://www.rt.com/news/368746-un-ruling-free-assange/). Julian has also been refused to leave the Embassy with a police escort for medical treatment as well as denied to attend Gavin MacFadyen’s funeral. The UK’s behaviour is appalling and clearly has no respect for international law. The reported raid on the Embassy during the latter part of October seems more plausible when taken in the context of past behavior.

This is the Britain I now live in: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html. I never used to be ashamed to be British.

[Combined capabilities of intelligence agencies]
We know much about the combined powers of the intelligence agencies. We know what they are capable of, thanks to the leaks of Edward Snowden. The combined powers of the NSA, CIA and the UK’s GCHQ are capable of pulling off such a massive takeover of Wikileaks. We know the NSA works with other US intelligence agencies, we know that the NSA works with GCHQ.

We know about Tempora, we know about JTRIG, we know about PRISM, we know about HAVOK. We know that websites can be altered on the fly, we know that real-time voice profiling is trivial for these agencies. We know that censorship is happening.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)

The NSA has a remit to be 10 years ahead of the curve. We have commercial products that can be purchased off the shelf today that can easily manipulate audio and video. Just imagine what the NSA and the military are capable of.

Real time facial manipulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk Signs of editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O9t_TEE1aw. Both Julian Assange and John Pilger are not filmed together at any time during the interview. There is also no establishing shot. It is also claimed that Assange’s audio is spliced and edited. No recent events mentioned by Assange, only Pilger. Unfortunately, this interview is not sufficient proof of life.

What the NSA can’t do, is that they cannot break PGP encryption. This has been expressed by Glenn Greenwald who was one of the journalists that Edward Snowden leaked to. He commented that he knows how secure PGP is because the NSA keep moaning about not being able to crack it in their documents he is reading. This is another reason why a signed PGP message can be the only true proof that WL isn’t compromised. Mathematics cannot lie, people can and do. A compromised WL can’t sign a message without the private key.
Edward Snowden revealed that in 2013 the NSA were capable of 3 trillion password attempts per second. As it is now almost 2017, that number will likely be multiple times higher (anywhere between 9 to 15 trillion attempts per second would be my guess based on Moore’s law).

[WikiLeaks down on October 17th]
The alleged raid on the Embassy supposedly took place on the 17th just after 1am GMT. On Monday the 17th of October 2016 WikiLeaks website was reported down (http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/wikileaks.org.html expand the comments) https://postimg.org/image/6t68fe4kj/. The internet was alive with reports of mass censorship around this time. This all coincides with when the alleged WikiLeaks takeover occurred. It also coincides with John Kerry being in the UK.

[Christine Assange audio only radio interview] Julian's family had their identities changed quite a few years ago after receiving death threats. It is odd that his mother has now revealed herself to a news agency. If you do a YouTube search for Christine Assange (her original name), you'll find all the videos are older than 3 years. She's in hiding, not openly talking on radio shows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange scroll down to the personal life section).

[WikiLeaks bitcoin account was emptied on the 18th of November] Interestingly it was after the bitcoin account was emptied that the encoded message in the blockchain was left. Why would WikiLeaks go to all that trouble when they could just sign a message with their PGP key? Is it because bitcoin accounts can be cracked and the PGP keys can’t?

[Mass censorship] Facebook is censoring this event (https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/). It has been advertised for weeks now any only a handful of people are attending. Recently Wikileaks was live on FB. 50% of the viewers (roughly 2.5k) were commenting #PoL, #Whereisassange, RIP etc. The live event was only a prerecorded video being played in loop. Once it concluded, the whole Live event along with all the comments including the comments asking for PoL and PGP signed message were deleted. It was as if it never took place.
When Julian’s DMS had supposedly been activated, I saw posts in threads being deleted within minutes. Supposedly with encryption keys, but it all happened too fast for anyone to collate. I took PDF printouts of the pages and then later noticed that posts and entire links were taken down. I have PDF's of pages that now no longer exist. I've been following this since mid-October and seen the censorship first hand. I know many people here on reddit witnessed the same (please comment with your experiences).

[WikiLeaks reposting old stuff]
There are many examples of this already mentioned in the timelines. One for example is the Palantir Technologies report. Palantir Technologies prepared a report on how to destroy WikiLeaks that was leaked in 2011. The proposal was submitted to Bank of America through its outside law firm, Hunton & Williams. Palantir later apologised for their involvement. But WikiLeaks has recently regurgitated it as if it was new. There are many examples of this. I have watched as WikiLeaks have increasingly destroyed their credibility.",conspiracy,NSA

I don't need to explain to you the NSA's wealth of information. Knowing what they collect on us, can you imagine what they collect on potential threats to their operation? Think about who could potentially hurt the NSA. Insider whistleblowers, of course, foreign agents, sure. Surely they are protected against attacks from other US federal agencies. It is completely logical that the NSA has data on Comey going beyond the regular amount of data they keep on citizens. **Comey is a potential threat**. FBIanon told us of pedofiles into human trafficking.. Is it possible they have him dead to rights in a children trafficking ring? FBIanon seemed to imply that very high up and imortant people to the case may be involved.

Not long ago, an NSA whistleblower told us that the leaks came from the NSA. This was kept very quiet, but now it's all coming together. **The NSA does not want Hillary to be president**. They must have thought the emails would be enough. Or that more would be released. Or that Assange would still be alive, willing, and able to release the smoking guns that FBIanon claimed.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/nsa-whistleblower-us-intelligence-worker-likely-behind-dnc-leaks-not-russia


So instead of sink Comey,  they approach him with a win-win situation. They allow him to announce the re-opening. This allows Comey to save some of the soul that he sold to the Clinton Carter. I'm sure he hasn't been sleeping well. He knows what he did. The weiner case provides a perfect conduit to trace the data along in a way that doesn't include evidence obtained illegally and thus inadmissible in court. FBIanon: "" **The leaks will have to be made in a non-transparent fashion.**

Comey's reputation is somewhat restored as now he's *finally* done the right thing. The NSA has gotten what they want in that Clinton is not in office. (I do wonder what her plan was for the NSA that caused the agency to dispise her so?) The whole thing is very, very clean. The NSA has  operated as a surgical knife, cutting away the cancer that is NWO. These are likely the heroes who's names we will never know.

>**A Special Access Program is an intelligence program classified above top-secret. They are held on closed servers at secret locations. The only way to get one is if you are specifically read on to a program, have a need to know, then you must physically go to a location and pass through several layers of security to even look at the program. A good example in non-classified terms would be the locations and operations of our intelligence operatives around the glove, or our missile silo locations.**

>**SAP is granted on a need to know basis, and Hillary did not have any need to know any of the programs on her server.**

>**All I can tell you about the SAPs is that Hillary had them, and she did not have proper authority to have any of them. They were leaked to her by someone, and she did sell them to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason.**

This sounds to me like NSA-ONLY level access.

*more on SAPs*.. Is this the reason the NSA hates Hillary? What information did she have?

>**Someone leaked them to her.** (My Edit, NOT FBIanon: Stephens?????)

> **Secretary of State CAN have access. That does not mean he/she WILL. SAP is granted on a need to know basis, and Hillary did not have any need to know any of the programs on her server.**

*What is HRC guilty of?*

>**Treason of every kind, multiple violations of the Constitution and the Espionage Act.** Espionage act. She has NSA information.





*And most importantly*
>**If you dig hard into the Clinton Foundation and make it the sole point of your focus, you will remember this thread when the truth is revealed.**



**Hillary Clinton somehow obtained information that was categorically ""beyond classified"" - On a possibly NSA ""Need to know"" only basis. She then sold that information to overseas agencies. FBIanon has been correct up until now, and applying his words to this theory is fucking chilling. Did Hillary try to go head to head with the NSA? Did this information contain information about the NSA directly?**

Depopulation, Revolution, or Mass Overhaul are our options.",496.0,prmvbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/prmvbr/hey_conspiracy_friends_weve_hit_a_societal/,124.0,1632109053.0,"
WARNING: This is a long, LONG Post. It may be one of the most important posts on this sub in awhile because it’s true, spoken from the heart, and coming from a place of immense worry and thoughtfulness. If you don’t have the time to read, please skip this post to another. 

First, thank you all for taking the time to read this. I will cut right to the chase, but I want to warn the shills/bots, this post is not for you. I seldom have time to interact with NPCs, much the less the desire to.

So let’s proceed. Australia has fallen. Canada is in the midst of falling. Europe is looking bleak. There are mass protests all over the globe. Awareness is growing faster than censorship can keep up with. 

We are at a crossroads in our society. We are at the point of no return. The globalists, the Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission, The World Economic Forum, The United Nations,  The Gates Foundation, The Elites; whatever you want to call them or label them as, have gone all in. (At this point if you don’t recognize some of these groups, it is essential to understanding them.) 

If you deny this much, stop reading here. This post is too much for you and you have much homework to do if you believe our leaders of any party, three letter agency, or politicians give a single shit about you. They don’t. Go back to your safe space because this post is about reality.

The teeter totter hypothesis proposes that society happens in cycles, and eventually when a cycle is made, there can only be one outcome, the question is, how do we decide the outcome?

We must weigh our options carefully to keep the teeter totter balanced. But eventually societies and nations collapse. Even the great ones. Sumerians fell. Egyptians fell. Greeks fell. The Romans fell. The Aztecs fell. The Mayans fell. Germany fell. The USSR fell. 

A myriad of cultures, languages, political systems, capital systems, ideologies, races, all fell in due time. It is the way of life, but time marches forward, and like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, man also lifts himself up after the worst of tragedies, wars, and famine.

The United States is currently that society falling. I realize Reddit is much bigger than America, but the brutal truth, despite the massive disinformation campaign globally to make America seem inept after years of Trump, is that we are the leading hub of the world. I’m just about every metric. We are the leading cultural hub of the world. We are the largest consumers. We produce entertainment through Hollywood and music. We have the most public companies. New York City is the center of finance in the world. Silicon Valley is the center of technological progress. We have the largest military in the world. 

And yet, we have failed.

America has failed. Some have connected the dots and realized this, some haven’t, some still believe in their futile attempts to resurrect a nation that time has passed by. To my next point, again I reiterate, if you believe any democratic or Republican politician, Biden, Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, AOC, etc. is going to save you, stop reading. You have much homework to do. We are entirely past that. No three letter agency or institution is going to come to your rescue.

We have been domesticated as a species to accept our mundane way of life the past 6 decades. You go to school to get a job to pay your taxes to have children and continue the cycle. You hopefully enjoy a hobby or two, a musical instrument, play a sport, read some books, and then you die. 

We have lost all spiritual and religious connection. The almighty dollar and the rat race to the bottom fuels all. Communism doesn’t work, and capitalism is the best we have. Rules for thee, but not for me. There is no middle class. That’s a myth. There’s only those with capital, the poor, and the less poor. Humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth. The difference between 100k and 1 million, isn’t all that different than 1 million and 1 billion to the average mind who considers these numbers an after thought. The fact that the top tax brackets ends at 400k and upward is a travesty when one considers the wealth of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.

The ‘leaders’, whether elected or not (looking at you Klaus Schwab), have planted their flags into the ground and made their global stance known. In order to form a global government, a government of a global people with a common goal and ideology, nationalism, capitalism, borders, and pride in your nation must be eradicated and driven out. 

No matter your views on origin, treatment, or the real facts of Covid, one thing is certain. The elite class has taken advantage of the opportunities at every turn. If you cannot see the writing on the wall, again, please stop reading. Go to another sub. This is the conspiracy sub, not CNN or WorldNews. There they will coddle you and reinforce the sheep narrative of confirmation bias with a revolving door echo chamber.

The grim reality is that society is a carefully crafted illusion that is a house of cards. If businesses stopped worldwide even for a day, the system collapses. If the world currency exchange quit relying on the US Dollar and Federal Reserve, the world collapses. We are mere moments at any given time from complete anarchy. This is why these elites, no matter how high they perceive themselves in a world of lesser people, have to be kept somewhat in check. Mass societies turning on their politicians (public servants) is all it takes for a complete revolution.

They have to keep things balanced to maintain order and the illusion of a society that knows no bounds and life is just peachy. 

Now with AI and tech surpassing prior levels of understanding at a rapid pace, the world is changing. Soon there will be no need for police officers. Robotic entities will replace them. Every cashier will be replaced. Every mundane function will be replaced. In time, these giant monopolistic corporations will be able to produce revenue without you. At that point we will be expendable. Cattle. Leeches of a dying system. And it’s coming. You can deny it, run from it, stall it, but it’ll inevitably arrive all the same. The only choice you DO have is how you will react in this lifetime. 

Many or most of this entire generation doesn’t know the harsh realities of history. They have lived in relative times of peace and prosperity. Even the poor in this country will have an iPhone with a roof over their head and a warm meal to keep them from starvation. 

The first possible solution is depopulation. It’s a relatively simple decision to arrive at. There are too many people. Not enough resources. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs. Too much healthcare costs. Fiat money is collapsing under inflation in real time. Climate change will cause large swaths of populations to have to migrate to other lands. Foot shortages and supply chain breakdowns are inevitable. The cozy life you know of being able to get anything and everything down the street at the local Walmart is winding to an end. 

So it seems like a decent proposition to the global elite. The populace is waking up. Kill them off. Reset the system. And educate (propaganda) the youth to reteach them everything about our society. After all, history is written by the victors, not the losers. 

To anyone wondering why Covid would be used to depopulate us and what they have to gain, that’s a large part of that answer. The fourth industrial revolution. So according to this option, we surrender, most die through one means or another, and we place our trust in a global syndicate that has laid out a path and foundation for society to progress forward, albeit in vastly smaller numbers of people. 

Option 2. Revolution. 

You can only achieve so much in this world by peaceful and meaningful protesting. Nobody wants violence. Nobody wants bloodshed. Most of humanity just wants their right to liberty and freedom, to spend cherished time with their loved ones, and perhaps even contribute to society in a great way. We just want to be left alone. 

But when you push people into a corner, much the way a scared animal reacts, people will snap if you push them too far. When a percentage of society hates you just for being white, or straight, or believing in a higher power than themselves, our society has been lost past the point of return. Divide and conquer is a real strategy that has been taking place for millennia. Their biggest free is our solidarity and unity; humanity taking care of themselves and uniting no matter their race, gender, political affiliation, age, culture, or economic background, against the very people who try to divide and distract us from the real evils of society.

The narrative shifts when it suits their purposes. Notice how the previous summer the BLM riots and destruction were justified in the eyes of the elites? They were entitled to it. It was for a just cause. But yet, when much more peaceful protests happens at the nations capitol, in the oddest, most unique election in our nations history believe there is foul play and protest, they are criminals. Any time true protests or riots happen, suddenly they are painted and smeared by the media. If we went by today’s standards, these same politicians would have you convinced that our founding fathers in 1776 were insurrectionists against England. 

Well no shit. That’s the point, the people had enough and revolted. No taxation without representation. Take your laws, kings, and unjust taxes and shove it up your ass. We no longer comply and submit to the King or any of their bestowed leaders. We are a United Nation of free people with the right to pursue life and liberty. 

…but today, our nation is being slowly brainwashed into believing we are all an evil divided people who must look to those very same leaders who sought so many generations ago to escape. Real revolution  requires this. It’s an undeniable fact. No real revolution has ever been spurred by protestors sitting in the streets stopping traffic with “tax the rich” signs. It happens when leaders lose their carefully crafted grip on the people and no longer can control them, forcing them to relinquish power and submit to the will of the people, 

The last and least likely option is mass overhaul. This would’ve been possible in simpler times. But the tentacles of this empire make Rome look like Child’s play. When corruption spans many nations and peoples, let alone the agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI, FDA, IRS, NIH, WHO, CDC, FDA, etc. 

It’s lost. It’s too far gone. And overhauling a system spanning decades of infiltrated corruption is impossible. It must be completely eradicated from the foundation up. Our founding fathers tried their best to ensure we would never be overtaken. They knew from the very beginning, if America fell, it would be from within its own borders, not externally from another source. 

The media, big pharma, big tech, big government, and the military industrial complex have consolidated so much power it’s just simply not conceivable to overhaul such a vast and broken system. 


We are now at a crossroads in humanity. Our leaders have failed us. Our public servants betrayed us. Our CEOs enslaved us. 

The teeter totter is starting to rock back and forth, losing its balance. The scales are tipping. The only control they have over it is censorship and age old techniques to convince the populace of their desired outcome through mass scale propaganda. 

I want you to ask yourself. In 20, 30, 40 years, will you be able to look in the eyes or your child, and explain to them how we let it get so bad? Will you be able to justify staying silent? Because you were scared to lose your reputation? Your job? Your friends? 

Because that time is coming. Our world is changing. Tech is replacing God. Public education is replacing wisdom. Adultery and greed is replacing love and selflessness. Our history is being erased and rewritten. Our freedoms are slowly eroding away in the name of safety. Our privacy is slowly being stripped in the name of security. Our data is being harvested and sold to the highest bidder to keep us in this perpetual never ending cycle of a slow descent into hell. 

I don’t care if your leader is Ghandi, Biden, Jesus, Mohammed, Trump, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It is time to unite as a people and reclaim our rights as a humanity. To love our neighbor. To give back to the less fortunate. To extend our hand and help one another. To show love and freedom of expression. 

Because if we don’t. Make no mistake the teeter totter will continue to tip. And it will eventually tip the scale towards depopulation or revolution. I only ask that we come together as a society, as a United people before it is too late. 

God Bless, and remember you do matter in this lifetime. You’re more than just a cog in the machine. You’re meant for more. Your thoughts matter. Your life matters.",conspiracy,NSA

#Remote Viewing

##Project StarGATE
[CIA powerpoint on Project StarGATE](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2.pdf)

[Remote Viewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at [SRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International) in the 1960's with the famous psychic [Ingo Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann). The two most famous physicists involved in these experiments were [Russell Targ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Targ) and [Hal Puthoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff) who were very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics which would allow for psychic abilities to operate.  Ingo was one of the first members of [Project StarGATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project) which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program ([source](http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562)). I will be referring to the CIA in this section because of their recent declassification surrounding a lot of these documents.

[This is an example](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf) of using Remote Viewing (astral projection) to spy on a Soviet base off the Ural Mountains

[Here is a document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) purporting to show a Remote Viewing session of Mars at 1 Million B.C. which we will come back to later in the post.

##Revisiting Quantum Mechanics

[Nonlocality]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality) is a property of Quantum Mechanics which states that entangled particles affect each others' quantum state instantaneously, seemingly transmitting information faster than the speed of light. In [this](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) CIA paper we gain insight into what the CIA calls [The Gateway Process](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/catalog/122) using [Hemi-Sync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-Sync) technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:
> You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works

He then goes on to explain the foundations of [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation), [Brain Coherence](https://npepjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40810-015-0015-7), [Holograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a universal consciousness matrix, [OBEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience) and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.

As if this isn't strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell's conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:
>Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded

This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness.

##Quick aside - Connection to DMT?
There is a lot of research done by people such as [Terrence McKenna]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna) which shows that psychedelic drugs (which places the subject in an altered state of consciousness) often cause the subject to see and interact with seemingly intelligent entities while tripping. [This great article](https://www.sociedelic.com/apparent-communication-with-discarnate-entities-induced-by-dmt/) shows an undeniable correlation between ingestion of psychadelics and contact with intelligent entities.

##Remote Viewing and Humanoid Contact
Revisiting the [Mars paper](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:
>SUB: I'm seeing ah.... It's like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it's only a shadow. It's as if they were there and they're not, not there anymore.

>MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.

>SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they're very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes. 

>MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.

So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was *specifically* the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:
>MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.

>SUB: They're ancient people. They're ah... they're dying, it's past their time or age. They're very philosophic about it. They're looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can't seem to get their way out, they can't seem to find their way out... so they're hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...

> MON: What is is they're waiting for?

>SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It's like I'm getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It's failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.

...

>MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?

>SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn't know who I am. Think he perceives I'm just a hallucination or something.

>MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?

>SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.

>MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.

>SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it's very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.

From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.

#Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs
It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950's, so I don't intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.

##Emails to John Podesta from Edgar Mitchell and Tom Delonge
Regardless of your opinion of Tom Delonge, I think it's important to include these emails here because it shows at the very least government and military officials involved with the coverup of the UFO phenomena cooperating with him and feeding him information which is tied to the psychic phenomena and crashed UFO sightings. For important sections of the emails I will include quotes.

[General McClasland working with Tom Delonge](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3099)
>When Roswell crashed, they shipped it to the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was in charge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago.

[Email showing Tom's involvement with Vice on a docuseries](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/57684)

The juicier emails come from the 6th man to walk on the moon: [Edgar Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell). He outright claims human interaction with ETI.

[Email showing Terri Mansfield setting up a Skype meeting for Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6983)
>Dear John,

>In ongoing requests for our Skype talk to discuss Disclosure and the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent obedient ETI and the celestials of this universe, and because Hillary and Bill Clinton were intimates of Laurance Rockefeller who had an avid interest in ETI, I direct your attention to Scott Jones, PhD.
In Scott’s book Voices From the Cosmos, he describes himself as an octogenarian in full karmic payback made following 30 years in the military, half in combat arms and half in intelligence.
He references you in his ETI matter, as well as the Catholic Church.
Disclosure is now top priority for ETI itself in protection of the people.

[Email with an attached space treaty that was voted on by the UN in 2008 and 2015](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802)
>Dear John,

>Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk. Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.

[Email discussing extraterrestial disclosure](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41591)
>John, I would like to schedule a phone conversation at your earliest
convenience to discuss what I feel are intensifying imperatives for
extraterrestrial disclosure.

>For many years you and I have shared a mutual vision of disclosure. I highly commend your public record urging disclosure which includes the forward you wrote for Leslie Kean’s book and your call for the Pentagon’s release of 25 year old classified government papers on UFO investigations. When our government releases this classified information we become the twenty-fifth country to make public disclosure.

>You and I also share a mutual vision for earth sustainability apparent in the escalating demand for a change in global energy policy. Our phone discussion will also include the zero point energy research and applications developed by my Quantrek international science team. Advanced energy science is linked to consciousness research and public disclosure of the extraterrestial presence.

* Pays major US telecommunications providers (AT&T, Verizon, et al) between $278,000,000-$394,000,000 annually to provide secret access to all US fiber and cellular networks (in violation of the 4th amendment).

Congress just got back into session: call your Congressmen once a day until these programs end.  **I am, and they encourage it, because it gives them a platform to fight on.**  Find yours [HERE](http://www.contactingthecongress.org/), save it to your phone, and make it a 30 second call... just give your information and tell them they need to vote to end these programs immediately so they can report your opposition and the passion of your opposition (the daily call) in their metrics.

We just prevented a war in Syria by calling Congress: calling works.  We can win again here.  6% of the US population reads the front page of Reddit, and 2014 is an election year.  30 seconds, once a day.  Just call: you will end these policies.

Since that transition, companies have been using user sourced data for things like advertisement even going the lengths to provide the NSA AND government intelligence agencies information on average citizens. There is no privacy protection for the average internet user anymore.

Furthermore, he wrote, a ""critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program.""

\>**Workers’ rights:** Kavanaugh wrote a 2016 opinion saying employers can require workers to waive their right to picket in arbitration agreements.

&#x200B;

\>**Religion and schools:** Kavanaugh has suggested he may be open to widening the flow of public funding to religious schools. In [an essay](http://www.aei.org/publication/from-the-bench-the-constitutional-statesmanship-of-chief-justice-william-rehnquist/) last year for the American Enterprise Institute, he cheered the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist's efforts to reverse prior Supreme Court attempts at ""erecting a strict wall of separation between church and state"" — especially when it comes to schools. 

&#x200B;

\>**Net neutrality:** He called the FCC’s net neutrality order an ""unlawful” First Amendment violation in a 2017

&#x200B;

\>**Financial regulations:** He wrote an opinion declaring the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a powerful banking industry watchdog first envisioned by Elizabeth Warren — to be unconstitutional. Writing for a three-judge panel, Kavanaugh said the 2010 Dodd-Frank law had wrongly placed “enormous executive power” in the CFPB’s single director, which Republicans and the banking industry want to replace with a multi-member commission. Supporters of the CFPB accused Kavanaugh of acting as a partisan activist, and the constitutionality of the CFPB's structure was later upheld.

\>A brief overview of the nominee’s judicial record reveals someone who routinely defers to the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has for decades refused to change marijuana’s restrictive status under federal law. For example, Kavanaugh sided with the majority in a 2007 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which determined that terminally ill patients [don’t have a constitutional right](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1098828.html) to access drugs that haven’t received FDA approval.

At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US.

- Eschelon was on 60 minutes back in the year 2000 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfdm78zcv8o The relevant part is 13 minutes. Highly recommended. 

Is the surveillance aimed only at ""bad guys?"" Nope, that was a lie as well. 

- How America Spies on Europe and the UN -- President Obama promised that NSA surveillance activities were aimed exclusively at preventing terrorist attacks. But secret documents from the intelligence agency show that the Americans spy on Europe, the UN and other countries. The NSA describes the [Blarney] program's main targets as ""diplomatic establishment, counter-terrorism, foreign government and economic.""

Spying on Associated Press – The Justice Dept was caught spying on Associated Press by collecting months worth of phone records at the news wire, as well as the home phones of reporters and editors. The telephone records the DoJ secretly investigated included the phones at the AP’s offices in Washington DC, New York, Hartford, and even the AP’s phone inside the US House of Representatives.

Spying on Fox News – The DoJ monitored the personal email and phone of a Fox News reporter, as well as the Fox News phones in New York and Washington. The Justice Dept said the news outlet had temporarily lost its press freedom when its reporter received classified information from a CIA whistleblower.

War on Gun Owners – AG Holder has said that his interpretation of the US Constitution is that the Second Amendment guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms only applies to the Militia. And to him, the Militia is the modern day National Guard and Reserves. Researchers have pointed out that in every instance where state and local authorities have sought the legal advice from the DoJ on proposed gun control laws, the Justice Dept has approved every single one.

Protecting Black Power and Voter Intimidation – On Election Day in 2008, the New Black Panther Party had set up at Philadelphia polling places, threatening white voters, hurling racial slurs and stopping white voters from voting. The tactics were caught on video and the assailants were identified. After a national outrage, the DoJ refused to take action on either the hate crimes or the Voting Rights violations.

Stimulus Program – Out of President Obama’s $800 billion 2009 ‘Stimulus Program’, AG Holder was handed $1 billion of the money to be handed out to local law enforcement officials across the country. Most of the stimulus money turned out to be used as kick-backs to Obama campaign contributors, including Eric Holder who himself was a top campaign bundler for the 2008 Obama campaign.

Foreigners voting in US Elections – Through his entire tenure, the Attorney General has steadfastly insisted that voters not be required to prove their identity when casting a ballot. The AG publicly touts that his DoJ has challenged two dozen state laws and Governor’s executive orders requiring voters to show an official ID before voting.

Foreign Terrorists have Rights – The DoJ declared that foreign terrorists captured almost anywhere other than a military battlefield were entitled to the same civil rights as US citizens.


Buying the Justice Dept – In his book ‘Extortion’, author Peter Schweizer details how President Obama chose the people who would head his Justice Dept – he sold the positions. ‘When President Obama established his Justice Department staff after the 2008 election, something unprecedented happened,’ Schweizer writes, ‘For the first time, at least half a dozen senior positions were occupied by individuals who had been campaign bundlers (fund raisers) for a presidential candidate, including not only Attorney General Eric Holder but also senior officials who dealt with criminal and civil prosecutions.’ Those high level Justice Dept appointees who are accused of buying their jobs are, ‘Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli, Deputy Associate Attorney General Karol Mason, and Associate Attorney General Tony West.’

Stealing 1,000,000 American Homes – Immediately after the housing collapse of 2007 and the economic collapse of 2008, America’s largest mortgage lenders began criminally foreclosing on hundreds of thousands of American families without cause and using ‘robo-signing machines’. Most didn’t even have mortgages, much less with those banks. Sheriff’s across the country removed a half million American families at gun point for no legitimate reason, only because banks had fraudulently filed foreclosure papers. The number of victims was so large, the DoJ cut off new claimants in 2012 when the number of properties stolen by six Wall Street banks hit 750,000. Since then, hundreds of thousands more families have been refused any justice or reimbursement at all by AG Holder. And for the 750,000 families the Justice Dept sued the banks for and settled with, the banks were ordered to pay each family an average of $2,000 each – $2,000 as total reimbursement for a $100,000 home criminally stolen, and all the furniture and possessions inside when the bank and police forced the families into the street. The settlement negotiated by the Justice Dept also bars the victims from ever suing the banks to get their money back. The five banks that stole one million American homes and businesses and were protected by AG Holder and the DoJ were Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Ally Financial.

Prosecuting Journalists – When Anonymous hackers leaked documents from Defense Dept contractors showing that the corporation had a program to spy on the American people inside and outside their homes, a number of news outlets covered the story. Three, including the New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica, along with a handful of freelance journalists, included links to the leaked material online where it was posted by Anonymous for the whole world to see. The DoJ arrested and prosecuted one freelance reporter, charging him with 17 different criminal counts, all because he included the same website link that the other publications published for their readers.

Protecting UBS Bank – When the DoJ was forced to sue UBS bank for defrauding its customers, AG Holder had to recuse himself because UBS was his former client when he worked at a Washington law firm.


Protecting Illegal Immigrants – In 2010, the Arizona Legislature passed a law giving its State Police the authority to check the immigration status of anyone police suspected of being here illegally. The DoJ sued the state of Arizona to overturn the law, insisting it was the DoJ’s privilege to enforce the country’s immigration laws, not the states.

Jon Corzine and MF Global Connection – Former Democratic New Jersey US Senator Jon Corzine left office to lead the financial firm MF Global, where he stole, pocketed or gambled away $1.6 billion he authorized taking from customers’ bank accounts. The bank’s law firm at the time was Covington & Burlington. Both AG Holder and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer were recent employees of that firm. The DoJ chose Associate Attorney General Tony West to prosecute Corzine and MF Global. West came from the firm Morrison & Foerester, which was handling MF Global’s assets at the time.

DoJ Hiring Discrimination – In 2011, documents were revealed showing that AG Holder and the Justice Dept’s Civil Rights Division used political litmus tests to hire employees. After President Obama’s election in 2008, Holder publicly announced that the Justice Department was “going to be looking for people who share our values.”

FBI Assassination Plot of Occupy Wall St leaders – In 2011, two separate FBI offices – Houston and Jacksonville – published internal memos detailing a proposal to identify, photograph and assassinate Occupy Wall Street leaders using snipers. MIT students sued for the details and won. But the DoJ only turned over partial excerpts of 5 of the 17 known FBI documents on the secret project. AG Holder has refused to release the remaining documents or explain the secret assassination program at all.

Lying to Congress – In 2011, the DoJ admitted to providing false testimony to Congress in their investigation of the Justice Dept and Fast and Furious.

Assassinating American Citizens – With the targeted killing of Americans beginning in 2011, President Obama became the first President to order the death of an American citizen without charge, trial or conviction. He went on to assassinate an American child using the same secret targeted killing program. AG Holder not only publicly approved the President’s legal authority, but personally endorsed it.

Fast and Furious – In 2012, the US House voted AG Eric Holder in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over thousands of documents exposing the true account of the DoJ’s secret gun trafficking operation which supplied over 2,000 military weapons to Mexican drug cartels. The gun-running operation began in 2009 and was run out of the Phoenix US Attorney’s office along with the BATF.


Protecting Mexican Drug Lords – In 2012, national media outlets confirmed that the drug lord and prime target of the DoJ’s secret Fast and Furious operation, Manuel Celis-Acosta, was actually taken into custody by the Justice Dept twice during the program. But both times the DoJ released him without charges.

Anti-white prosecutions – In 2013, when the violent ‘knockout game’ trend was circulating social media, the DoJ got involved and prosecuted a perpetrator for hate crimes. But while the dozens of videoed attackers were all black and admitted targeting white victims, AG Holder found the only known white perpetrator and charged him instead.

Too Big to Jail – In 2013, AG Holder testified before Congress answering America’s question of why not a single banker went to jail for the criminal activity that led to the global economic collapse in 2008. He explained that Wall Street financial institutions had become too big and too important. He freely admitted that the Justice Department had its hands tied and couldn’t prosecute any of the banks for fear that it would lead to their collapse and that would lead to another global financial crash.

Spying on Americans – In 2012, two US Senators warned the American people that they’d be horrified if they knew how President Obama and AG Holder were interpreting and executing the Patriot Act. Forbidden by law from telling America themselves, the US Senators called on the AG to declassify the DoJ’s interpretation of the counter-terrorism law. AG Holder refused. The ACLU sued and the Supreme Court agreed. The DoJ still refuses.

Protecting Senators Reid and Lee – In 2012, the DoJ announced it would not get involved in a criminal investigation of US Senators Harry Reid and Mike Lee. In a multi-state criminal scandal that already forced the Utah Attorney General to resign, local Republican and Democrat District Attorneys asked the DoJ for help because the two accused criminals are US Senators. AG Eric Holder refused. After ABC News broke the story, one outlet described the criminal accusations against Senators Reid and Lee as, ‘a massive crime ring that involves gambling, bribery, kickbacks and influence peddling.’

Protecting the Director of the Office of National Intelligence – In 2013, ODNI Director James Clapper testified to Congress that the NSA isn’t collecting massive amounts of intelligence on all Americans as Edward Snowden’s leaks revealed. He later admitted that his testimony was a lie, but that in the interest of national security, he was above the law and not answerable to Congress. A number of Congressmen called on AG Holder to charge Clapper with Contempt of Congress. Eric Holder refused.

War on Medical Marijuana Patients – Even though medical marijuana is legal on the state, county and local level in 23 states and DC, the DoJ has led hundreds of military-style raids on legal medical marijuana pharmacies across the country. Rather than target drug cartels and illegal drug dealers, the DoJ has violently arrested hundreds of cancer victims, AIDS patients, dying senior citizens and war wounded.


War on Whistleblowers – In place of investigating criminal acts in government exposed by whistleblowers, the DoJ has instead prosecuted the whistleblowers. At last count, six government employees have been arrested and charged, more than all other administrations combined.

Giving Nukes to Iran – In 2000, the CIA accidentally gave blueprints for a nuclear bomb to Iran. Shortly after, a reporter from the NY Times was given the details by a CIA whistleblower. The Times refused to violate the government-imposed black-out of the story. So in 2006, the reporter published the information in a book he authored. AG Holder is prosecuting him under the Espionage Act for telling the American people.

Protecting Wall Street Banks – After six years, the DoJ has not put a single banker in prison over the economic collapse of 2008. While many of the same banks were given slaps on the wrist for causing the housing collapse a year earlier, many more banks were fleeced by the Justice Department for billions of dollars in civil penalties, paid to the Dept of Justice. In exchange for massive payoffs, no criminal charges were ever filed against anyone and few victims among the American people ever got their money back.

Protecting Rogue IRS Employees – After countless acts of admitted perjury by IRS directors and managers over the targeting of conservative political organizations by the agency, and the revelations that all the emails and computer records covering the time in question and all the IRS employees in question, have all crashed and self-destructed, AG Eric Holder still refuses to appoint a special prosecutor.

These employees include Activision Blizzard’s new Chief Administrative Officer, [Brian Bulatao](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/leadership/brian-bulatao), who served in the Trump administration as the Chief Operating Officer of the CIA and joined Activision in March 2021, fresh out of the executive branch. Another hire from March, Activision Blizzard’s new Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs, [Frances Townsend](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/leadership/frances-townsend), is a former Bush White House aide who [defended the administration’s torture](https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-hires-bush-era-torture-apologist-as-1846398541) of prisoners at U.S.-operated prisons such as Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. [Grant Dixton](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/leadership/grant-dixton), who became Activision Blizzard’s Chief Legal Officer in June 2021, had previously served as a legal advisor to President George W. Bush. Perhaps the most unexpected Blizzard employee to have possibly been involved in the Bush administration’s crimes against humanity is WoW director Ion Hazzikostas, who may have played a role in keeping Guantanamo prisoners detained indefinitely without due process. Notably, none of these employees had any experience in the video game industry before joining Activision Blizzard. The troubling backgrounds of these executives raise some serious questions about the company’s values and goals.   

**The Guantanamo Connection**

Last week, Activision Blizzard hired the law firm Wilmer Hale to conduct an internal investigation into the company’s alleged culture of harassment and discrimination.  Wilmer Hale is well known for cultivating high-profile government officials, and it’s clear the firm has [close ties](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/solutions/national-security) to the U.S. intelligence establishment. The firm seems to be a revolving door for attorneys moving between national security and intelligence positions in the federal government and private practice. 

One of Wilmer Hale’s former associate attorneys is none other than WoW Director [Ion Hazzikostas](http://www.lawyerdigs.com/profile/Hazzikostas-Ion.html). Ion has spoken occasionally about his legal background, but it isn’t widely known. After completing a prestigious clerkship with Judge Raymond Randolph of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, he joined Wilmer Hale, where he worked on white collar criminal defense and internal investigations. His colleagues at the firm included a number of attorneys who played key roles in the war on terror: government officials such as Stephen W. Preston, former CIA general counsel; Jamie Gorelick, a former Deputy U.S. Attorney General and member of the CIA National Security Advisory Panel; and David S. Cohen, the current CIA Deputy Director, who, like Ion, [worked on white collar criminal defense and internal investigations](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/news/2017-09-07-david-s-cohen-former-cia-deputy-director-and-treasury-under-secretary-rejoins-wilmerhale) at Wilmer Hale’s D.C. office. (Ion isn’t the only Blizzard employee to have worked alongside CIA Deputy Director Cohen. Helaine Klasky, Activision Blizzard’s Chief Communications Officer, was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Treasury Department from 1999-2001—the same years that Cohen was a legal advisor at the Treasury Department and [“helped craft legislation that formed the basis of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act.”](https://nationalsecurity.gmu.edu/david-s-cohen/))

Ion likely has his own share of experience participating in the war on terror. Roughly around the time Ion was a clerk for former CIA Director and President George H.W. Bush-appointed Judge Raymond Randolph at the D.C. Circuit, the court was hearing important cases regarding the George W. Bush administration’s policies during the Iraq War. Due to the D.C. Circuit being the only federal appellate court with jurisdiction to hear cases from detainees at Guantanamo Bay, a flurry of high-profile habeas petitions from Guantanamo made a stop at the D.C. Circuit on their way to the Supreme Court. Many of these cases were decided by Judge Raymond Randolph, who wrote opinions in cases like [*Boumediene v. Bush*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/06-1195), *Al Odah v. United States* (consolidated with *Boumediene* at the Supreme Court), and [*Hamdan v. Rumsfeld*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/05-184). As a clerk, Ion would have helped Judge Randolph decide these cases and probably would have written early drafts of the opinions. 

In these landmark cases, Judge Randolph **ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees have absolutely no rights under the U.S. Constitution** and that the Geneva Convention cannot be enforced there. In [*Al Odah*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1202319.html), Judge Randolph likened the petitioning Guantanamo prisoners to Nazi soldiers, despite the petitioners, some of whom were captured nowhere near the Middle East, maintaining their innocence. 

Although all three of Randolph’s high-profile Guantanamo rulings were later overturned by the Supreme Court, Judge Randolph has [become infamous](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/opinion/supreme-court-guantanamo.html) for trying to limit the scope of the Supreme Court’s reversals and doing all he can to prevent Guantanamo Bay detainees from accessing their constitutional rights. In 2010, he gave a talk titled [“The Guantanamo Mess”](https://www.c-span.org/video/?296127-1/wartime-military-detentions-trials) at the Heritage Foundation, a partisan conservative think tank, where he criticized the Supreme Court’s reversals of his rulings and said that the Court had “ripped up centuries of settled law” when it gave Guantanamo prisoners certain constitutional rights. According to Randolph, the Supreme Court created a “legal mess” by ruling that, at Guantanamo, “the questioning of prisoners may have to adhere to some sort of judicial norm. Exclusionary rules may be enforced. Evidence may have to be handled and preserved in a certain way approved by the court.” In 2017, [Judge Randolph ruled](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9777096058108592010) that video footage of Guantanamo inmates being force-fed (i.e., tortured) cannot be released to the press. (Luckily for prisoners, Guantanamo detention facility has a [large library of Activision Blizzard games](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/sep/05/gaming-gitmo/) [that they can play while being force-fed through a tube in their nose.](https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/6/5785724/gitmo-video-games-guantanamo-bay) This isn’t a joke.)

We will likely never know the full extent of Ion’s judicial work, since behind the scenes details of the judicial decision-making process are often kept confidential; but Ion very well could have played an important supporting role in Judge Randolph’s crusade to imprison terrorism suspects indefinitely without trials. [Speaking about his role as a clerk for Judge Randolph](https://youtu.be/RkUJicjaw8E?t=1037), Ion has said that he “helped my judge reach conclusions of law,” and worked on cases that he “would see in newspaper headlines.” Ion should come forward to the WoW community and clarify whether he played a role in these Guantanamo cases. If he didn’t participate in the cases, he should still explain why he would work for this judge. It goes without saying that the U.S. treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo is abhorrent, and anyone who has been complicit in the government’s detention and torture of prisoners at Guantanamo is guilty of serious human rights abuses.

**Blizzard, Intelligence Asset?** 

Ion completed his judicial clerkship and joined Wilmer Hale as an associate in 2005, and then left for Blizzard in 2008. Coincidentally, documents leaked by Edward Snowden show that in the months preceding Ion’s start at Blizzard, federal intelligence agencies had [developed plans to infiltrate Blizzard and World of Warcraft](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/spies-dragnet-reaches-a-playing-field-of-elves-and-trolls.html). The documents show that the NSA considered World of Warcraft a “target-rich communication network” and sent spies to “begin taking action now to plan for collection, processing, presentation and analysis of these communications.” A Blizzard spokesperson said they had no knowledge of the operation: “We are unaware of any surveillance taking place … If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission.""

Currently, two “former” intelligence officials have offices in Activision Blizzard’s executive suite. Activision Blizzard’s Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, who worked in the Trump administration until January 2021, had been known as a bully who [fired investigators tasked with uncovering misconduct](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/steve-linick-mike-pompeo-inspector-general.html) in the Trump administration. He now oversees Activision Blizzard’s human resources department and Corporate Social Responsibility activities. Activision Blizzard’s Vice President for Corporate Affairs, Fran Townsend, played a key role in covering up torture at Abu Ghraib. When Ms. Townsend visited the prison site in 2004, a high point in the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” during the Iraq War, [she claimed not to have witnessed any mistreatment of prisoners](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/19/bush-adviser-toured-abu-ghraib/c0f8485d-74e6-4445-9ec2-92f15938fc73/), and said she was completely unaware of allegations of human rights abuses. She later [explicitly defended the Bush administration’s use of torture](https://am.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/17/fmr-bush-adviser-release-of-memos-handcuffs-future-administrations/) and argued that federal agents who had used techniques like waterboarding should be immune from public scrutiny because they had performed torture within an appropriate legal framework. She is now responsible for ensuring Activision Blizzard complies with U.S. laws and internal policies. 

It is troubling that Activision Blizzard would task Ms. Townsend with sending a [letter to all Activision Blizzard employees](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421?s=20) claiming that California’s lawsuit tells a “distorted and untrue picture” of Activision Blizzard—which she insists “takes a hard-line approach to inappropriate or hostile work environments and sexual harassment.” Her denial of the allegations against Activision Blizzard rings just as hollow as her phony denial of the Bush administration’s illegal torture program. How can Activision Blizzard employees and shareholders trust that allegations of illegal harassment and discrimination will be taken seriously when the corporation’s own chief compliance officer has a history of covering up egregious war crimes? 

The connection here between Activision Blizzard and the intelligence establishment should frankly disturb everyone, and should not be accepted as normal. There should not be a place in the mail room, let alone the board room, for anyone who played a part in the federal government’s torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.  

It is unclear why Blizzard has a history of hiring intelligence officials and firms with close CIA ties. There isn’t any direct evidence suggesting active government involvement with Activision Blizzard today. However, what we do know is that the federal government has long had an interest in infiltrating online video games and at one point had its sights set directly on Activision Blizzard. We also know that Activision Blizzard’s employees with federal government ties had joined the company despite having virtually no video game industry experience. In addition, we know that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is listed in the [“black book”](https://epsteinsblackbook.com/black-book-images/31.jpg) of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, [who was allegedly involved with a federal intelligence agency](https://observer.com/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-spy-intelligence-work/). (According to Alexander Acosta, who prosecuted Epstein in 2008-2009, Epstein “belonged to intelligence.”)

Based on the above, I think Activision Blizzard needs to take a serious look at its employee roster and decide whether its leadership reflects the values it claims to have. Activision Blizzard owes its employees, shareholders, and customers answers about its possible ties to U.S. intelligence agencies. Activision Blizzard owes them an answer as to how it plans to reshape itself into a corporation that doesn’t foster a culture of pervasive, illegal harassment and discrimination. Eliminating war criminals from its staff would be a good first step.",conspiracy,NSA

The problem comes when wiretaps include U.S. citizens in contact with foreign targets. That’s called “incidental” collection. And it’s not just phone calls. Today’s wiretaps can include everything on the web — emails, bank accounts, photos, messaging, Facebook posts. And “incidental collection” can include anything picked up when a target is watched directly, through a bug, or by secretly activating his computer’s microphone and camera.

U.S. citizens who aren’t accused of crimes are entitled to strong constitutional privacy protections. So, to alleviate worries that citizens’ rights might be violated through “incidental” spying on foreign targets, the intel agencies adopted strict rules. At first, they promised to destroy any “incidental” intelligence they collected. Later, they decided to store it — for a short time — but promised that the names of the U.S. citizens would be “masked,” or hidden, even internally.

Then, they argued that they needed to store the information on U.S. citizens a little longer, and might occasionally need to “unmask” or reveal their names. Still, “unmasking” was supposed to be extraordinarily rare, requiring a high-ranking official’s approval accompanied by a strong legal argument that the citizen’s name is crucial to addressing some national-security threat. 

But several years ago, intel insiders tell me, the process was corrupted. Here’s how: 

An official who is a bad actor may want to monitor a U.S. citizen — say, a political enemy or a journalist — but knows he could never get wiretap approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). So he develops a pretext to wiretap a foreigner or a target in contact with that citizen. He then “incidentally” captures the citizen’s information, too. Later, he builds a case for “unmasking” the U.S. citizen’s name, supposedly for national security or other crucial reasons. 

Here’s the best part — for the bad actors. The U.S. citizens are usually none the wiser. The surveillance isn’t intended to build a criminal case; it’s to collect dirt or political intel or blackmail material. So the corrupt process is never scrutinized in a U.S. court.

Think of it as reverse engineering of intel.

In 2016, very real questions were raised about whether reverse engineering of intel was widely deployed in an unethical manner. A red flag waved when we got a sense of how many Americans are “incidentally” surveilled — so many, that near-daily unmasking requests were said to be made in 2016 under the name of a single official: United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power.

Who else was involved? Then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates, national security adviser Susan Rice, and Director of National Intelligence Clapper. Clapper said he requested unmasking of American names “[every couple of weeks](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/7/james-clapper-made-unmasking-requests-to-identify-/).” Apparently, it became so common that Clapper told Congress he probably made some requests on his way out the door before Trump’s inauguration, but couldn’t recall the specifics.

Rice initially claimed she knew nothing about the unmasking of surveilled Trump associates. Later, she admitted on MSNBC that she had asked for names of U.S. citizens previously masked in intelligence reports. 

Add to all this the report that, during 2016, the Obama administration vastly [expanded](http://circa.com/politics/president-obamas-team-sought-nsa-intel-on-thousands-of-americans-during-the-2016-election) its searches for information about Americans in the National Security Agency (NSA) database. In 2013, there were 9,500 searches involving 198 Americans. In 2016, that escalated to 30,355 searches of 5,288 Americans.

Sure, it’s possible all that spying on U.S. citizens, all those unmaskings, were on the up and up. 

But what if my sources are correct and at least some of these actions are not on the up and up? After all, our intel agencies have gotten caught in significant abuses, despite FBI Director Christopher Wray incorrectly [testifiying](http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/365131-fbi-chiefs-claim-on-surveillance-abuse-doesnt-fit-the-evidence) to the contrary.

In 2016, an inspector general found “widespread” abuse of key provisions designed to protect Americans. A FISC judge found so many violations that he described them as an institutional “lack of candor” and “a very serious Fourth Amendment issue.”

Does any of this have something to do with the NSA reportedly listening in on Congresswoman Jane Harmon (D-Calif.) as she spoke to pro-Israel lobbyists? Somebody [leaked](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/the-danger-of-nsa-spying-on-members-of-congress/282827/) her unmasked name in 2009. Or the recordings of Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) in 2011 as he spoke to a Libyan official? Those were later leaked to the press.

What about [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-spy-net-on-israel-snares-congress-1451425210) of our intel officials listening in on U.S. members of Congress in 2015 as they communicated with Israel’s prime minister about the Obama administration’s Iran deal?

Is it why Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) asked whether they’d been surveilled? Or why, at a [hearing](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/08/yates_and_clapper_admit_unmasking_trump_campaign_communications_deny_leaking_to_press.html) in 2017, Yates and Clapper [admitted](https://www.c-span.org/video/?427577-1/white-house-warned-general-flynn-compromised) having reviewed and possibly [shared](https://www.c-span.org/video/?427577-1/white-house-warned-general-flynn-compromised) “classified documents in which Mr. Trump, his associates or members of Congress had been unmasked”?

Could it help explain my own case in which government spy software was found on my work and personal devices?Hypothetically, if bad actors abused their authority, might they be so anti-Trump partly because a wildcard Trump administration could be expected to unearth what they’d been doing all these years?

One final note: Last October, Amb. Power reportedly told congressional investigators that many of the hundreds of “unmasking” requests in her name in 2016 were not made by her. If true, it implies something equally problematic, or worse: Someone else in the government used her name to unmask Americans.

The good news would seem to be that there’s documentary evidence of all this ... if anyone wants to discover it. There are names of who requested what and when, information as to where unmasked intel was sent, names of those who searched the NSA database and under what auspices. Unlike a lot of facets of the Trump-Russia-intel controversy, this trail should be easily traceable.

But we just might be too busy chasing the pretty colors flashing before us every day. They might be keeping us from taking a good hard look at a very serious matter.

On February 4th, 2017, Wikileaks posted a very strange Tweet, and they have continued to release one (with the hashtag #Vault7) daily since then (through today, Feb. 9th, 2017).

First, [here](https://postimg.org/gallery/2088uhz6q/) is a gallery containing all of the images.

Now on to each individual post:

[**What is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65ad71655.jpg) Posted Feb. 4th, 2017. A picture of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen near Longyearbyen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago, about 810 miles from the North Pole.

[**Where is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65aebfe9f.jpg) Posted Feb. 6th, 2017. A picture of the Merkers salt mine. Merkers-Kieselbach is a former municipality in the Wartburgkreis district of Thuringia, Germany. The Merkers area of the municipality is famous for its salt mine, which is now exploited as the Merkers Adventure Mines visitor attraction. Here large amounts of Nazi gold, and many stolen works of art were discovered by the United States Army in 1945. General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself went into the mine in April 1945 in order to examine the find.

[**Who is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65af1b823.jpg) Posted Feb. 7th, 2017. A picture of Chelsea/Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden. Three extremely famous whistle-blowers.

*Chelsea Elizabeth Manning* (born Bradley Edward Manning, December 17, 1987) is a United States Army soldier who was convicted by court-martial in July 2013, of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses, after disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly three-quarters of a million classified, or unclassified but sensitive, military and diplomatic documents. Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years' imprisonment, with the possibility of parole in the eighth year, and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army. On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted all but four months of Manning's remaining sentence; she is scheduled to be released on May 17, 2017.

*Julian Paul Assange* (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, which he founded in 2006. He has won numerous accolades for journalism, including the Sam Adams Award and Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 but came to global prominence in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks, provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. In November 2010, a request was made for Assange's extradition to Sweden, where he had been questioned months earlier over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Assange continued to deny the allegations, and expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States due to his perceived role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered himself to UK police on 7 December 2010 and was held for ten days in solitary confinement before being released on bail. Assange sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. Assange has since remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, and is unable to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions. In 2016, WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and the Podesta emails during the United States presidential election, 2016.

*Edward Joseph Snowden* (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.

[**How did #Vault7 make its way to WikiLeaks? -**](http://i.imgsafe.org/c9039166e3.jpg) Posted Feb. 9th, 2017. A picture showing Stasi surveillance of mailboxes in Berlin. When mailboxes were being observed by Stasi agents, every person posting a letter was photographed. Some films found in the Stasi archives also show persons dressed in civilian clothing emptying the mailbox after the conclusion of the surveillance action. Mass surveillance in East Germany was a widespread practice throughout the country's history, involving Soviet, East German, and Western agencies. On 8 February 1950, East Germany saw the establishment of the Ministry for State Security (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit), commonly known as the Stasi. The Stasi sought to ""know everything about everyone"". Its annual budget has been estimated at approximately $1 billion. Out of a population of 16 million, the agency kept files on nearly 6 million of its citizens. The Stasi had 90,000 full-time employees who were assisted by 170,000 full-time unofficial collaborators (Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter); together these made up 1 in 63 (nearly 2%) of the entire East German population. Together with these, a much larger number of occasional informers brought up the total to 1 per 6.5 persons. People in East Germany were subjected to a variety of techniques, including audio and video surveillance of their homes, reading mail, extortion, and bribery.",conspiracy,NSA

The purpose of these Agents Smiths are to:

1. Make conspiracies and theorists aka truth seekers look dumb ie ""so you think \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?""; usually an extremely weak argument logically or attacking the user not argument
2. Misdirect people ie through fake conspiracies like ""no one died in las vegas""
3. Frustrate posters\\thinkers
4. Make legit posters\\thinkers leave via the above and things like #10
5. Push agendas
6. Make us fight against each other ie dems vs reps, trump vs biden, christians vs muslims, progressive\\liberal, left\\right, it's all China, West\\East (scapegoating when it's really two heads of the same beast) - divide and conquer
7. Make legit people like Kanye, Russell Brand seem like they're in on it ie ""so you think a millionaire will help us plebs?"" (this ties into #8: hopelessness)
8. Spew hopelessness and hate  ie that"" whistleblower is going to die"" or ""well we can't do anything about it"" or ""people are so dumb""
9. Make us passive ie ""God\\Jesus will protect us"", ""Q\\Trump will drain the swamp"", ""looking forward until the timeline changes""
10. Spread degeneration and perversion ie look at her milk jugs or something about penis
11. Traumatize\\frustrate\\scare new\\curious people - running them out of here, away from researching or discussing topics.

This list goes on and on but it's a very sophisticated tactic and it is important not to be programmed by them. Don't let bullshit comments invoke any anger or frustration.  Don't scroll too quickly only to find a comment that hits your confirmation bias and makes you lean the wrong way. IE when reading a post about the dangers of fluoride, one of these agents will post a comment that says ""Well, children shouldn't be swallowing toothpaste anyway so this is stupid."" If you're already overwhelmed by the thought of a new world order out to get you, a comment like this is exactly what you're subconscious wants... to flee instead of fight.

Sort posts by new, comments by top. Read them all, even the negative ones. Before fully mentally shelving a users comment or agreeing with their stance, check their history. Anyone with over 50k - 100k karma is pretty suspect since legit posts that will enlighten the masses will be purposely downvoted. If they post multiple times every 10 minutes, another HUGE red flag. Skim through a couple comments, do they seem like a nice person. Do they post on insightful subs? If they comment on sexual subs, thats usually a big red flag too. Lots of these accounts will post on very niche subs to make it seem like they're just real people who are interested in paintball guns or cameras or fountain pens. If they post on spiritual forums, and seem like they're trying to help others, thats a HUGE GREEN one! - unless they post constantly post bullshit about demons or sex.

Also next time you post or comment and the votes seem to be stuck at 0. Leave the post\\comment on the active tab and hit refresh (f5 or swipe down on an app like RIF) - multiple times a second. You'll notice it go up to 1 or 2 and then back to 0. If it's really good, it'll hit the 7-8-9s on the brink of hitting the next denominator of 10 and then drop back to 7-8-9 again. But do not despair! The reason why they do this is to make us feel hopeless. Trust that people like me and others that know how all of this works actually do see and read your posts and comments even though the manipulated statistics don't reflect that.

Facebook isn’t the only organization conducting research into how attitudes are affected by social media. The Department of Defense has invested millions of dollars over the past few years investigating social media, social networks, and how information spreads across them. While Facebook and Cornell University researchers manipulated what individuals saw in their social media streams, military-funded research—including projects funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Social Media in Strategic Communications (SMISC) program—has looked primarily into how messages from influential members of social networks propagate.

One study, funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), has gone a step further. “A less investigated problem is once you’ve identified the network, how do you manipulate it toward an end,” said Warren Dixon, a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering and director of the University of Florida’s Nonlinear Controls and *Robotics research group*. Dixon was the principal investigator on an Air Force Research Laboratory-funded project, which published its findings in February in a paper entitled *“Containment Control for a Social Network with State-Dependent Connectivity.”*

The research demonstrates that the mathematical *principles used to control groups of autonomous robots can be applied to social networks in order to control human behavior.* If properly calibrated, the mathematical models developed by Dixon and his fellow researchers could be *used to sway the opinion of social networks toward a desired set of behaviors* perhaps in concert with some of the social media “effects” cyber-weaponry developed by the NSA and its British counterpart, GCHQ.

DARPA launched its SMISC program in 2011 to examine ways social networks could be used for propaganda and what broadly falls under the euphemistic title of Military Information Support Operations (MISO), formerly known as psychological operations. Early in July, DARPA published a list of research projects funded by the SMISC program. They included studies that analyzed the Twitter followings of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber among others; investigations into the spread of Internet memes; a study by the Georgia Tech Research Institute into automatically identifying deceptive content in social media with linguistic cues; and ""Modeling User Attitude toward Controversial Topics in Online Social Media”—an IBM Research study that tapped into Twitter feeds to track responses to topics like “fracking” for natural gas.

The AFRL-sponsored research by Dixon, Zhen Kan, and Justin Klotz of University of Florida NCR group and Eduardo L. Pasiliao of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate at *Eglin Air Force Base* was prompted by a meeting Dixon attended while preparing a “think piece” for the Defense Science Study Group. “I heard a presentation by a computer scientist about examining behaviors of people based on social data. The language that was being used to mathematically describe the interactions \\\[between people and products\\\] was the same language we use in controlling groups of autonomous vehicles.”

The social drone graph

That language was Graph theory—the mathematical language that is the basis of Facebook’s Graph database and the “entity” databases at the heart of Google and Bing’s understanding of context around searches. It’s also become a fundamental part of \*\*control systems for directing swarms of autonomous robots\*\*. The connection inspired Dixon to want to investigate the connection further, he said. *“Can you apply the same math to controlling autonomous people to groups of people?”*

Dixon’s group had been doing other work for AFRL around robotics, and when he mentioned the idea to a contact there, he was connected with researchers within the same group at AFRL who were interested in social media topics. With funding in hand, the research team worked to model how collaboration between “key influencers” in social networks could affect the behavior of groups within the network by using the *principle of “containment control.”*

Dixon explained the concept this way: “There’s a group of leaders, each of which has their own objectives, and they have their own topic of emphasis. The goal is to have those people change the opinion or coerce the group of followers—people \\\[who are\\\] in the social group of these people but don’t know the high level objective.”

**Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism**

GCHQ’s “Chinese menu” of tools spreads disinformation across Internet “Effects capabilities” allow analysts to twist truth subtly or spam relentlessly.

What appears to be an internal Wiki page detailing the cyber-weaponry used by the British spy agency GCHQ was published today by Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept. The page, taken from the documents obtained by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, lists dozens of tools used by GCHQ to target individuals and their computing devices, spread disinformation posing as others, and “shape” opinion and information available online.

**Inside the British Army's secret information warfare machine**

*They built bots and “sockpuppets” – fake social media accounts* to make topics trend and appear more popular than they were – and swarmed together to overwhelm their targets. *They started to reach through computers to change what people saw, and perhaps even what people thought.* They celebrated each of their victories with a deluge of memes.

The lulz were quickly seized upon by others for the money. Throughout the 2000s, small PR firms, political communications consultancies, and darknet markets all began to peddle the tactics and techniques pioneered on 4chan. “Digital media-savvy merchants are weaponising their knowledge of commercial social media manipulation services,” a cybersecurity researcher who tracks this kind of illicit commercial activity tells me on condition of anonymity.

“It’s like an assembly line,” he continues. “They prepare the campaign, penetrate the target audience, maintain the operation, and then they strategically disengage. It is only going to get bigger.”

A range of websites started selling fake accounts, described, categorised and priced almost like wine: from cheap plonk all the way to seasoned vintages. The “HUGE MEGA BOT PACK”, available for just $3 on the darknet, allowed you to \*\*build your own bot army\*\* across hundreds of social media platforms. There were services for manipulating search engine results. You could buy Wikipedia edits. You could rent fake IP addresses to make it look like your accounts came from all over the world. And at the top of the market were *“legend farms”, firms running tens of thousands of unique identities, each one with multiple accounts on social media, a unique IP address, its own internet address, even its own personality, interests and writing style.*

**EDIT:**

Not only are they spreading disinformation and manufacturing consent, they also spread pervertism and obscenity to degrade and morally corrupt society. If one looks at the history of a lot of these bots, especially the ones with crude names like LongDongBob or ThiccBoy69 (i made those up) they consistently post and comment about sexual, and homosexual things like random comments about H. Bidens privates that contributes absolutely nothing to the discussion. Extremely damaging to impressionable YA that think real people think that way.

Re: ""With funding in hand, the research team worked to model how collaboration between “key influencers” in social networks could affect the behavior of groups within the network by using the principle of “containment control.”""

That is exactly what Q was created for. Containment control. Same with Alex Jones - mixing a little truth to make things look real.

Look how ridiculous Alex Jones' segment on Ivermectin is. He's essentially teeing himself up to be ridiculed so folks like Kimmel can clown on him and make truth seekers look insane.

**EDIT 3 (new thread):**

The top subs are all heavily censored and botted. politics, technology, parenting, whatever... they're ALL programming centers. Any comments that start with ""Well, I'm a doctor, lawyer, mother of 5...."" is bullshit, used to skew public perception to their advantage. Stay away from this subs, dont comment on them, don't read anything on them. They will do more harm than good, no different than looking up news from the MSM.

**EDIT 4 (new thread):**

Almost forgot.... be weary of bots that are purposely programmed to interact with other bots. For example...

Bot 1: Wait, but how can flouride be so bad if it's in all tooth pastes? My doctor even said it was important.

Bot 2: I've studied this for over a decade. Flouride IS important, my brother is a dentist.

Bot 1: OMG, thank you so much for clearning that up. I was starting to worry for no reason!

Bot 2: No welcome, my good old buddy, pal, friend, homie. These people have no idea what they're talking about scientifically.

Bot 1: No kidding!  Thank you so much for clearing that up for me. I almost started worry about it for a second. Whew this gives me peace of mind.

Bot 2: Yeah brother, don't let these paranoid schitzo get to you. My children's teeth are so white and clean!

Check the deleted comments. Note who deleted them. Note how my interaction with said account purposely used sarcasm which machines have a hard time with processing. Why would they delete a random, seemingly harmless comment like that?

**EDIT 6 (new thread):**

Quick anecdote.... So back when I was in the beginning stages of seeing through the veil, round 2018 or so... I was very pessimistic, cynical, a la all hope is lost, etc. So I made a comment about how hmmm... Orwell, Bradley, Huxley - why would this kind of lit be taught in public schools - they were obviously trying to induce predictive programming! Surprisingly, this was a highly upvoted post. And then... I saw a comment, Yo you should join our sub, the top minds of reddit.

Bam, that's when I figured out these bots just don't downvote content that is detrimental to the establishment... they'll also upvote content that works to their advantage! Essentially promoting people thinking in the wrong direction.

After dabbling in spirituality, philosophy, esoterics, occult, theosophy, pantheism, mystery schools, ESP, parapsychology, jung, alan watts, manly p hall, the dao, hinduism, edgar mitchell, thoreau, emmerson, mark passio, jane robertes (seth), neville goddard, etc., etc., etc., it has become clear I was so lost in hopelessness that I failed to recognize the light shining through!

""Light can only be seen in the presence of darkness""

""A tree cannot reach up to heaven unless it's roots reach down to hell""

These bots spew a lot of shit but the scariest thing is hopelessness. Our thoughts create. The world ""believe"" in Spanish translates to ""Creer"" or ""to create"". I'm sure most of you have heard of manifestation or the Law of Attraction. That's where the war is being waged now - in our minds.

**David Bowie interview with Jeremy Paxman (1999)**

Bowie: Because I think that we, at the time up until at the least the mid 70s, really felt that we were still living under the… in the guise of a single and absolute created society where there were known truths and known lies and there was no kind of duplicity or pluralism about the things that we believed in.

That started to break down rapidly in the 70s and the idea of a duality in the way that we live. There are always two, three, four, five sides to every question. The singularity disappeared. And that I believe, has produced such a medium as the internet, which absolutely establishes and shows us that we are living in total fragmentation.

I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we’re actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.

Paxman: It’s just a tool though isn’t it?

Bowie: No, it’s not! No, it’s an alien life form (laughs).

Paxman: It’s simply a different delivery system though? You’re arguing about something more profound.

Bowie: Oh yeah. I’m talking about the actual context and the state of content is going to be so different to anything we can really envisage as the moment where the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico it’s going to crush our ideas about what mediums are all about.

**Edit 7 (new thread):**

Lastly just a quick reminder to go outside and feel the sun beaming on your body. Feel its warmth. Walk barefoot on the Earth and feel the electric energy reverberate through your body of energy and light. Look at another person and observe them making their way surrounded in their own universe of manifestations, thoughts and feelings. Now, notice how your own visual reality is being projected. For three minutes, just close your eyes, focus on your breathing. Slow it down and just be mindful of what thoughts pop into your head. Don't judge them, just observe. We are not our feelings, emotions, body or thoughts. We are the ones observing them.

Peace, love and light my brothers and sisters.

People scoffed at the article of the Utah NSA database that was published back in 2011. 

It's tough to post on here sometimes when your opinions are shot down by people that can't open a tab. I only reiterate this point, because people are still asking for links. 

Do your own research, if you are heavily skeptic. It takes the same amounts of time for me to pull up google and find you a link as it does for you to do the same. 

Lastly, many of those that ask for links just call bullshit or find a way to continue their argument. So, unless you're making some outlandish, new claim that hasn't been circulated in many sources on the internet, then you need a source.

Because, honestly, it's wasting my life to provide sources for those that are unaware of how their internet works.

This is all over the place..i know.

Edit: For example, if someone tells you, ""fuku will kill a third of the sea life"", then all you have to do is copy the parentheses and paste in google (or your preferred researching method). Then you'll have not only one, but multiple sources. That way you can tell the person that they are misinformed and show them or agree with them and ask them further. Spark productive conversation.

>House Resolution No. 205

>Sponsor: State Rep. Tom McMillin (R-Mich.)

>What it does: This resolution has one purpose—ousting NSA Director James Clapper. It reads: ""We urge the Congress of the United States and the U.S. Attorney General to prosecute Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for lying to Congress about the National Security Agency's collection of data on U.S. citizens...Effective congressional and public oversight cannot occur if the information presented to Congress cannot be trusted.""

Yesterday Congress was only 2.5% away from a majority vote to defund the NSA's data-gathering programs.",221.0,1j23ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1j23ae/if_youre_pessimistic_about_nsa_surveillance_dont/,110.0,1374790522.0,"Yesterday the House voted on Rep. Justin Amash's amendment to the annual defense spending bill for defunding any NSA programs authorized under section 2.15 of The Patriot Act (rguably the most controversial part of the Patriot Act)

The vote failed 205-217. Only 12 votes short of a ""Yes"" vote majority...thats 12 votes out of 422 voting representatives. And according to reports, the whitehouse made a huge lobbying effort against the amendment a few hours before it went to a vote. 

All this week, the top-upvoted comments on every post that I read (about the amendment) were comments about what a joke this all was & how it would never happen - Well, yesterday was the first congressional vote over domestic spying since secret NSA programs were recently made public, and it was a damn close vote. I'm sure many of the ""Yes"" votes were cast because it was the right thing to do, but I'm also sure many ""yes"" votes were cast out of representative's fear of their constituent's outrage.

Most of the representatives that voted ""No"" on the amendment today will be getting flooded with angry emails & phone calls about it for weeks and they'll get an idea of how many votes they'll lose in their next election if they stay on the wrong side of this issue.

So if you're on Reddit & you feel the urge to post a comment about how nothing can/will change when it comes to government surveillance - ***Don't*** - and instead spend that time on an email to your elected representative about today's vote on defunding NSA programs instead. 

[This](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) link will tell you who your representatives are from your zip code & provide all the information to contact them

[This](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml) is a link to the vote record of the Amash amendment. All the reps who voted are listed in alphabetical order, according to ""Yes"" votes & ""No"" votes (12 reps didn't vote & they're listed at the bottom)

**If they voted ""yes"", thank them. If they voted ""No"", ask them why they voted that way.** ***But above all, the most important thing is to tell them that government surveillance is an issue thats very important to you & why its important to you.***

TLDR: If you're spending time on Reddit pessimisticly complaining about domestic spying, spend that time contacting your elected official about how they voted yesterday on domestic spying instead. Congress won't act on this until the people force them to.

Since this creates a conflict of interest the solution most often employed in the past is to have someone from outside the department lead the investigation. 

In light of the fact that Obama chose James Clapper, the head of the NSA to look into, well, himself and his agency, about issues/concerns concerning the constitutionality of archiving every electronic communication in the US and sharing it with other agencies for purposes other than terrorism. It would seem that the situation is perfect for a special prosecutor to be brought in and investigate these potential unconstitutional search and seizures of data other than that which was handed over by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Hotmail, Facebook, etc.

Instead, in response to ""Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" he chose to give an answer: ""No.""

Or are we stuck with the kangaroo court which Obama and Clapper are assembling which will conclude that of course neither were ever engaged in any sort of wrongdoing. 

Clapper committed a felony by perjuring himself while testifying under oath, and his reward is to get to head up an investigation into his own agency.

Big Media (particularly the film and music industry) and
The financial industry.


I’d like to take a moment and set aside the longer-term dangers of creating a system that could be used for “turnkey tyranny”.  For now, I think it would be wise to follow the money. Let’s start with the current state of what I’m calling Big Media – industrialized music and movies.


In regard to the recent stories about making online piracy a felony, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/05/sopa-died-in-2012-but-obama-administration-wants-to-revive-part-of-it/ and the attempt to demonize ""hackers"" http://www.salon.com/2013/08/06/cyberscare_ex_nsa_chief_calls_transparency_groups_hackers_next_terrorists/singleton/  I feel like we’re beginning to see a larger picture. There is A HUGE amount of money lost from modern technology (film and music piracy). If Corporate interests and a bought-out Federal Government can collude to label all “hackers” (ie anyone who pirates anything) terrorists, then what would stop government organizations from going after everyone and charging people as felons? They wouldn't even need to go after everyone, once they start prosecuting people on a larger scale (which of course would be highly publicized by the also bought-out media) people would stop pirating drastically, putting the money right back where it “belongs”, which is back in the old business paradigms before the internet. That is to say, old money wants to maintain its status quo.


We as a people have nothing to gain from this, and much to lose.


Big media has a lot of money to lobby, http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000581 and I see this as a logical use of that money. I keep asking myself, who are the people that want these NSA/PRISM projects to move forward (in the short term)?

If you’ve ever had a diary – or even if you haven’t, you’re familiar with the scenario – you would be rightfully upset if someone violated your privacy by reading your intimate thoughts. In this scenario that you’re sure to be familiar with, as it is represented quite often in film and literature, a person’s parent, sibling, significant other, etc. is caught reading their diary. The diary owner invariably gets irate over it (especially if they’re a teenager), and responds with, “Oh my god, Mom! I can’t flippin believe you would read my diary! That’s PRIVATE! Ugh, I flippin HATE you!” 

Why does the diary owner get so upset? It’s simple really; they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In the scenario, if the parent is the NSA and the teenage diary owner is the citizen, each would claim and expect to have certain rights, and there would be a mutual understanding of such. The teenager would expect their parent to enter their room from time to time, and they would probably even expect the parent to go through some of their things like laundry, schoolwork, etc, but the diary is a sacrosanct object of privacy. Even if there was nothing but things like, “I love my parents so much!” and “I wish I could study and do homework more often,” written in the diary (which, granted, would be extremely unlikely for any American teenager), there is an almost universal understanding that the diary is a private, off-limit object. 

Your phone calls, texts, and e-mails are your diary, people! You may only have good things to put in it, but it is yours, and yours alone. If you want to make your private diary public, you could absolutely do that. We don’t call that a diary, though, we call it a memoir, and that is a choice for the person on a personal level, and last time I checked, there isn’t a government organization going around forcing people to publish memoirs. So, you may have nothing to hide, but you should still have that sense of injustice you would feel if someone had read your diary.

Perjury, also known as forswearing, is the willful act of swearing a false oath or of falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding. That is, the witness falsely promises to tell the truth about matters which affect the outcome of the proceeding.

There’s more than one side to consider here and reddit (in general) has been failing to foster a genuine discussion on this story that argues against the popular opinion. Here are a couple points I wanted to make: 

(Also check out [this panel] (http://csis.org/event/schieffer-series-discussion-data-surveillance-prism-and-nsa) on this very topic hosted by Bob Schieffer. I'll reference it implicitly and below, since it gels pretty well with my opinions.)

**1** **Stop calling this man a hero.** Seriously, I don't care if you believe in the cause he did this for or not we shouldn't be putting this guy on a pedestal. If you are participating in civil disobedience, part of that action, according to Henry David Thoreau, is to be willing to pay the price for those crimes. Look at Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, and Ghandi. These people are heroes. They stood up to injustice peacefully and paid the price, sometimes with their lives. *That's* heroic. Turning tail to China and Russia with a backpack full of secrets to sell is a coward's tactic. It’s the difference between being a whistle blower and committing treason.

Also don't take everything Snowden says at face value. In my opinion, he was overselling the info we had and what he really knows to make his product more appealing to the Chinese. The claims he was making seemed very far-fetched for someone in his position, and if he was planning to sell his information it stands to reason that he would try to make it sound more attractive for potential buyers. I can’t point to a lot of hard facts to back this up, but call it a hunch.


**2** To think that the NSA even has the capability to read every person's emails and listen to every person's phone calls is ludicrous. Do they collect everyone's meta-data? Yes. Is it illegal? No. Should we be discussing the merits of it is legal or not? **ABSOLUTELY.**

BUT...that conversation needs to be driven by FACTS, not fear mongering and speculation.

To think that the NSA has enough analysts to actually look at the content of everyone's communications data is a fantasy. Even if they had the capacity, the legal safeguards of preventing them from targeting innocent Americans means people can't just be targeted without reasonable suspicion without at judicial warrant.

I do get that the court that approves this activity is secret by nature, and I think it's fair to expect more transparency not just from this, but in general about this program. I feel that this should have been made public when it was implemented so we could discuss this in the public forum rather than it being leaked. PRISM is an instance where I feel the government used classification to shield their political reputation rather than national security.


**3** Like it or not, signals intelligence (SIGINT) is a necessity for tracking terrorists around the world. SIGINT is the foundation of intelligence against terrorists and other disciplines can't stand without it.  The capabilities that the NSA data collection gives us are instrumental in this sense. I do think we, as a country, need to have a discussion about just how threatening terrorism really is and how much of our fear is just a hangover from 9/11. In my opinion, terrorism is still a concern that necessitates a vibrant intelligence community that can handle such elusive threats. In that sense, I am more concerned about the potential for lives to be lost rather than my meta-data being stored.


**4** Regarding Germany's complaints toward the United States about spying on the EU and Snowden saying that they are ""in bed with each other"": he's right in a sense. Obviously friendly countries share intelligence. This is nothing new. But I would also have to assume Germany's outrage over the US spying on them is an act, or just extremely naïve. In the nation state system we live in, states don't have fixed allies, only interests. Every country spies on every other country, no matter what their allegiances are. Espionage isn't an act of war. It's how the game is played in this system. Even if you don't want to do that, it's irresponsible as a nation since your obligation is the safety and well-being of your people. If everyone else is doing it and you aren't, you're at a huge disadvantage. If the Germans are so upset, they should get better counter intelligence. This is obviously a very geopolitical/realpolitik take, and that philosophy has its flaws. But it's an accurate descriptor of the international system that we live in, which, in my opinion, works better than what humanity has tried in the past.



Anyway this is my opinion and feel free to respectfully engage me if you agree or disagree. And even though I disagree with how the part of the argument that is most prominent on reddit is taking over the conversation, it's still a conversation worth having. Keep speaking your mind and contact your congressional representatives and let them know how their constituents feel. An informed and honest electorate is what drives a successful democracy.

**TL;DR: Don't be lazy. Read things if you want to discuss them.**

**Edit 2:** Wow I didn't think this was going to get any attention. Thanks for the generally good and civil responses. I don't have time to respond to everyone here but I'm glad I fostered some debate. I did want to add a few things in general:

31,Jim Webb won the debate & here's why.,90.0,3oq99b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3oq99b/jim_webb_won_the_debate_heres_why/,236.0,1444834133.0,"In case you missed it, the Democratic Presidential debate was last night. If you have been following the campaigns you like most thought this was a 3 headed race, and barely that. It was narrated as a Clinton v. Sanders Battle Royale, with an O'Malley in the mix.

Literally every single story I've read and heard leading up to this debate and throughout the entire campaign season has focused on those three individuals. Tuning to CNN last night it was much to my surprise to see five candidates on the stage. Let's leave Chaffee out of this (I'm not sure he was all there anyways), and focus on the other four.

So we know the story of Clinton, we know what Democratic Socialist Sanders stands for (it's reddit after-all), O'Malley might not be as well known, but he didn't give me much reason to want to know more about him. However there was this other fellow on stage who was captivating, Jim Webb.

From the first answer he gave last night he had my attention. 

Cooper asked ""Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?""

*No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race.*

What an answer? Am I right? 

It was a prelude to a night filled with some of the most reasonable and responsible rhetoric I'd ever heard from a candidate. This is coming from someone who considers themselves a Republican.

Some of the highlights:

When people were going on about the gun debate and talking about how we need more gun control, or I did this, or I voted for this... Webb comes through with the only answer that actually makes sense.

*Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that.*

*A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.*

*WEBB: So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.*

*COOPER: Senator...*

*WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.*

You can't ask people living in places where a police officer is more than 30 minutes or an hour away to not be able to protect themselves. Not everyone lives in urban Baltimore Mr. O'malley & not everyone has bodyguards 24/7 Mrs. Clinton.

When talking about military force and whether or not it should have been used in Lybia. Webb, once again takes the issue and breaks it down into the components that really need to be examined.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?*

*WEBB: Look, let's start -- I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.*

*Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.*

Talking about the things happening in the Middle East without equating the cause & effect is pointless. The candidates looked for the rebuttal their constituents wanted to hear. Webb, answered the question with facts.

Further supporting his view with reasons and basis for why it is what is:

*This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.*

*There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings.*

*It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it.*

The conversation moved on to talk about Webb's decorated service and it is quite decorative. I sort of feel bad for only hearing about him last night, because the man is an American hero. When Cooper tried to engage him into calling out Sanders for dodging the Vietnam war. Webb eloquently said it's each mans choice, but that if you were looking for a Commander & Chief he is the most qualified. 

Isn't that true?

Who of those candidates, or of any on either side, are more qualified?

When Chafee tried to question Webb on his opinion that the Iran deal weakened America's position in the region. Webb once again retorted with a clear an accurate answer.

*I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.*

Btw, the only candidate to every mention Israel and our ally, in a debate which focused on the Middle East for a large swath of time.

Cooper asked each candidate what is the greatest threat to the U.S. Instead of giving an answer to a question that is way too complicated with a simplicity, like each other candidate did. Webb once again gives us an answer rooted in facts, understanding & reason-ability. 

*Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.*

Topics moved towards immigration and once again Webb seemed to be the only one that actually had a level headed approach to dealing with the issue. He was the only one on stage that said ""No country has -- is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue"". 

He actually presented a balanced answer that I think most Americans would support and his political history shows he has actually acted upon what he says. *I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.*

Every other candidate, especially O'Malley seem to think a country with no borders is a better America. I ask him to go look at how Europe is currently doing economically with those kinds of careless policies.

When talking about the NSA, Webb once again provides an answer that isn't just meant to rile up support, but actually rooted in reason. 

*We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought -- if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.*

Would anyone be opposed to that? We know we need to be protected, but that doesn't mean endless surveillance for endless time. I know I'm on video when I walk into a store, but that video doesn't need to be kept forever, and accessed by the privileged, if there is no reason. That's a sensible approach.

Speaking of sensible a lot of what was said on that stage is never going to happen. Sanders and his socialistic ideals are never going to pass in Congress. I know he wants a revolution, but Capitalist America isn't just going to become Denmark. 

Webb actually presented ideas that are possible, that can be done in a divided Congress. When asked about how he differed from Obama, he once again presents reasoned & accurate assessments.

*COOPER: Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?*

*WEBB: I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I -- Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.*

*I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead -- working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).*

It seemed like every candidate forgot that they wouldn't be issuing executive orders all day and that they would actually have to work with the Republicans to get things done. Can anyone tell me how in the hell Sanders would get anything that he wants done?

The conversation moved on to global warming. 

Candidates like O'Malley tried to tell us how we need wind turbines to fix our problems. Then Webb had his chance to defend his ""very different view"" as Cooper put it.

*You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are -- again, are you -- the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?*

*WEBB: Well, the -- the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?*

*And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.*

*We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on -- on doing that. The -- the agreements -- the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the -- of the Chinese government itself.*

*So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a -- a way to address climate change.*

Ding, ding, ding guess what Senator O'Malley Iowa's turbines don't mean anything when China & India are polluting the planet. To try and fix a global problem with domestic policy is quite possibly the most disingenuous thing one can do.

Webb wasn't given much of a chance to say the things he wanted, but when he forced his way into the conversation he said so much that made sense to me. He gave reasoned answers, he gave plausible solutions & he addressed concerns that so many either are unaware of, or have been sold a false narrative on.

Webb concluded his limited time with his closing statement:

*You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.*

*One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.*

*We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.*

*I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of -- of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.*

I always considered myself a Republican, but after watching the debate last night Senator Webb gave me a reason to believe in the Democratic party. I never thought I would say that. 

Webb is a man that I can stand behind and say, you know what, he actually represents me. He's not a career politician. He wasn't raised with a silver spoon. He has an immigrant wife who lived the American dream, and he wants to protect it. To make sure it exists for our future generations, like it did for her. He is a qualified Commander & Chief. 

Webb might not have been known by many before last night, but he certainly is known by many today. I hope those of you who think you already know who you are voting for will look at Webb and ask yourself, why not him. I know I will, and so far I haven't come up with a reason to say no.

TL;DR- Webb, a virtual unknown to many, came out on the debate stage and proved he is knowledgeable, qualified & reasonable. The only candidate that seems to be able to break the divide in Congress, the only one who isn't a career politician. Someone who wasn't raised with money & who's life is an example of the American Dream. Look at the debate and the things he said, and I think you too will come away with a greater appreciation for him.

To reveal what the government has been legally allowed to do is not whistleblowing, so why do people think Snowden is a hero or important in any way? Anybody who was interested has known the NSA procedures were legal and have been happening for a long time, and the laws were passed publicly and approved by the majority of the American people. Perhaps Snowden showed the American people what it truly looks like, thus bringing attention to the issue again, but STILL most Americans are okay with what the NSA is doing.

A lot of people take it for granted that there are gross 4th amendment violations occurring, but a lot of the jurisprudence is at the very least ambiguous on how to treat things like metadata. 

Beyond the government use, there seem to be differing opinions on how private companies should handle this information. Specifically, many of the libertarians impulses against these programs seem to be perfectly ok with private companies buying and selling your personal data for advertising purposes. But why do we look at things that way? Is it really in our interests for us to be allowed to sell that type of information? Legally, we can't sell ourselves into indentured servitude anymore. I'm sure there are libertarians who would argue we should be able to, but the vast majority would find that line of thinking morally repugnant. So why not extend individual protections for control of our physical bodies to control of our non-physical identities? 

If companies would be losing valuable information then at the very least couldn't we have requirements that those data points be made anonymous for those purposes? Is that even possible?

I guess what I'm getting at is that when any person goes online every single website they visit is pulling location information, browsing information, etc. All of this is ostensibly to improve their products, and we definitely all tacitly agree to these business practices on one level or another. But maybe we'd be better off if it wasn't so simple. Maybe it'd be better if any sort of trade-off regarding personal information for access occurred under a more limited framework. Maybe a company can use that info but can't sell it. Maybe there has to be some sort of ""black box"" clearinghouse that the info passes through making it impossible to link it back to a specific individual. Maybe something else.

The upshot of all of this, beyond protections against government intrusion, could be a stronger consumer hand regarding access to online content. Everyone in the traditional media establishments bemoan the collapse of the older advertising regimes, this might be a way to increase the value of this information to the point where a media consumer can trade their data in an anonymous way and benefit content providers even more. 

All of that aggregated data about you is cheap right now because it can come from anywhere and is traded cheaply. If a particular website can't sell your information but only provide a base for targeted advertising that would increase ad rates for that particular website and increase their revenue, hopefully leading to a better business model.

Justin Amash (R-MI) and John Conyers (D-MI) that would limit the National Security Agency’s (NSA) ability to gather information on individuals. I appreciate hearing from you.
 
Mr. Amash and Mr. Conyers introduced H.R. 2399, the LIBERT-E Act, as well as offered an amendment to the FY 14 Defense Appropriations Act, H.R. 2397, that essentially does the same thing – end authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act and bar NSA and other agencies from using such records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who are not the subject of an investigation.
 
There is no constitutional basis for NSA or any agency to be collecting the records of innocent Americans. In the decade or so since passage of the Patriot Act, government agencies have increasingly broadened the intelligence gathering scope of the Patriot Act well beyond its intended purpose. H.R. 2399 and the Amash amendment restrain the agencies and return the gathering of information authorized under the Patriot Act to its original scope.
 
I take the 4th Amendment protection against unlawful search and seizure seriously, as well as preservation of due process. That’s why I voted in favor of the Amash amendment when it was offered to the Defense spending bill. Unfortunately, the amendment narrowly failed.
 
The NSA will still needs to gather information on terrorists, but in doing so it should not abuse the civil liberties of innocent Americans. It may be hard to obtain information on individuals, but when it comes to protecting our constitutional rights, perhaps that is not a bad thing.

I like to think that I have a decent understanding of the conservative thinking, basically like this: the government tends to be generally bad and corrupt at doing anything, so government should be very limited; it is better to let the free market handle things. I understand this thinking, and I agree with it to a fair extent.

However, when it comes to the government's powers to do things secretly, like the NSA spying, many conservative/right-wing people seem to think it is OK for the government to be doing those things. This makes no sense to me at all. If the government is bad and corrupt at doing things in general, certainly it will be even worse and even more corrupt when it does things in secret?

Having thought a lot about this, I really cannot figure it out. How are these people thinking?

I understand that there are conservatives who are consistent and therefore do object against secret stuff, e.g. Rand Paul, but they seem to be a minority.

The only explanation I can think of that would make the low-tax/anti-welfare policies consistent with the endorsement of secret security programs is the following (admittedly provocative, but I really see no other explanation): 
*The real motivation for the conservatives/right-wingers opinions is that they want to preserve the inequalities in society: they want the rich to stay rich and the poor to stay poor. They feel confident that the secret government programs will be mainly targeting the weak/poor and protecting the rich/powerful, so therefore they are OK with these programs.*

There is a very simple, completely legal way to make your distaste for the current direction loud and clear.

Ideally, I would love to convince everyone to vote 3rd party. Green party, Libertarian... whatever else you would feel content casting a vote for. Nothing would make me happier than for Republicans and Democrats to both be a minority. However, I realize that asking Americans to step outside their little box, to sway from their norm is asking a lot. I know we have this mentality that voting for 3rd party might as well be voting for the other guy, so here is what I propose:

Vote for your party like you always have, simply vote for someone who is not currently in office. The American population could quite easily, without exceeding their social norm, cast a vote that would be heard loud and clear by the US government. It would send a message that would change the way congress governs for years to come.

In my opinion we should be aiming for a 100% turn over in congress. Most of these people are career politicians and they want to do whatever it takes to stay in office. Whatever it takes should be what the people of America want. If we don't get what we want, we should make that **painfully** obvious, and the best way to do that is to end their political career.

I'm pretty certain that the vast majority of Americans are unhappy with the current state of affairs and the trend in the police state, accomplishing 100% turn over should not be that difficult. Lets make it happen people.

This method should allow every device to connect and contribute to the new_net peer-to-peer internet-network. All wireless devices, router or laptop, would help aid in the transfer and the freedom of information. 

Given that ISPs only use about 2 cents / 1 GB, and charge us $1-2 for the same thing, it is becoming highly apparent that they will be greatly not needed in the future. 

Imagine sharing files from your house, without having to ask permission from your ISP, or worry about a hefty ftp server charge / or ban. Imagine using your cell phone for free, without any service charges or agreements in well-populated areas.

Because the FCC isn't doing their job with equal rights regulation of the internet, and falling to lobbying,  the government will adversely make it very tough to find criminals on the internet on their own. Because packets are decentralized, they would have to ask for individualized help to extract answers, instead of always spying on us. Hopefully this symbiotic relationship creates more trust between the people and their governments. 

The current form of Internet already includes decentralized compatibility functions. Such as packet distribution through multiple points. It just so happens that all packets are largely routed with ISP-owned routers. With the possibility of your information being blindly passed on from your ISP to 3rd parties such as the NSA, MPAA, RIAA without your permission.

In the future, routers in houses/busineses will contribute to the New'net using load-balancing features. This will be based on how much CPU power the router isn't using at the time, and what signal strengths are available.

Initially, ISPs will fight the idea, but they started this process a long time ago when they started putting data caps on 50 $ a month plans (remember that 200 GB would cost them about 4 dollars).  New'net will also alleviate everyones legal liability via anonymizing information packets. Information is free, and freedom of information should be as well (with only a very small electricity charge or zero with a small solar panel / battery) This method retorts humanity back into a positive mindset: that humans are generally caring of others, and they will do positive things if given the chance.

I'm personally in IT and am amazed at how supremely complicated the internet can get in its current form. This complication leads to blind eyes being granted, and backdoors being allowed. In this mesh-net scenario, the idea is to simplify and to take millions of cheap and simple devices and make them profoundly useful. 

tl;dr - Internets can be taken away from ISPs and ^^ is how it might happen.

Are the statutes governing obstruction that would ordinarily ensnare non-Presidents in conflict with the constitutional powers that are given to the president?

This includes military/police power (which tends to primarily be in government hands), as well as economic power (of which there is plenty of in the hands of governments, corporations, and other large organizations), and media power (often referred to as 'soft power,' or the power to influence peoples' hearts and minds.)

I feel the need to clarify and explain because there seem to be a lot of people who can't wrap their heads around the concept of structural power as anything other than ""government.""

**** ****

To continue-

Also -  I am referring to the typical politically aware individual on either the ""left"" or ""right.""  In other words, all of you.  **I am not referring to the politicians themselves.**

It seems a Libertarian/conservative would feel that minimizing the structural power concentrated in centralized government institutions, even if it means allowing structural power in private hands to become more concentrated, would still ultimately yield less concentration of structural power overall.

It seems a Progressive/liberal would feel that minimizing the structural power concentrated in private hands, even if it means allowing structural power in a centralized government to become more concentrated, would still ultimately yield less concentration of structural power overall.

So here, both sides want structural power **overall** to be less concentrated, but are willing to accept a little more concentration of it in one place.  This is because they each feel that the one place where they are willing to accept a little more concentration of power is easier for the less powerful masses to reign in.  

Ultimately most of us seem to be in favor of what we believe will lead to less concentration of structural power. Look at the things that most of us on the left or right (not including the politicians themselves or the less politically aware) do agree on:  Cutting military spending/overseas engagements, limiting the NSA, getting rid of vice laws, cutting government subsidies/bailouts to corporations, to name a few. These are all things that increase concentration of structural power somewhere without limiting concentration of structural power anywhere. 

Essentially the sole disagreement is this:  To libertarians/conservatives, the ability of the masses to reign in private/corporate power through their own purchasing power in the free-market exceeds the ability of the masses to reign in government power through their own political/voting power in the electoral process.  To progressives/liberals, it would be the other way around.

But we did forget. We completely forgot our values and way of life, and two skyscrapers is all it took.

Here are some irreverant but real thoughts to ponder on this day, the 11th anniversary:

1) For decades we lived the American dream but we FORGOT that abroad others lived the American nightmare as we carried on years of military adventurism throughout the world. A lot of Americans lived in such blissful ignorance of our aggressive foreign pursuit of American interests throughout the world that they were shocked when we were finally attacked. But even worse, some of us knew what was going on but somehow didn't think that eventually there would be some blowback like this.

2) It's often been stated that the difference between 'us' and 'them' is that when we fight wars, we don't target innocent civilians. Osama Bin Laden justified this by noting that Americans do not live under a monarch or a dictator. Can you really argue with that? We aren't just idly by for the ride while someone in a throne decides our country's miltary actions. We FORGOT that the buck stops with us. We FORGOT that this a participatory democracy. In so far as you believe in war, which we collectively as a people do, then we are responsible for the military actions carried out in our name.

3) In the decade following 9/11, we FORGOT that this was the Land of the Free. Nearly overnight we threw it all away. Kneejerk legislation like the PATRIOT Act, FISA, NDAA, HR347 combined with un-legislated acts of blatant disregard for the Constitution have resulted in the loss of our freedom. What's worse is we blindly keep celebrating our freedom when it's no longer there. Do folks still mistake freedom for our ability to buy Levis denim jeans while Soviet-era people could not? For better or worse, our vibrant consumer culture hasn't waned. But this is separate and apart from being free. You can still have malls in a police state.

And police state we have:

* Law enforcement and government now routinely wiretap us without the oversight of a judge, and for any reason (not just suspected terrorism). A lot of the crimes we found so aggregious in Watergate became commonplace in the last decade. We let this all slide so much that now the NSA has even constructed a multi-million dollar listening station in the Utah desert to monitor all of our private phone calls, texts and emails.

* Protection from undue search and seizure are a thing of the past. As is the ability to move freely about the country. Border Patrol and the TSA now set up random arbitrary checkpoints in the middle of highways. We are virtually or literally strip-searched in our airports. Citizens in our cities are routinely stopped and frisked. We FORGOT what we learned in school (at least I did) about the Stasi police in Nazi Germany barking ""papers please"" to civilians and what a contrast it was to our freedom. Now we allow it but somehow think it is fine because it is 'for our own protection'.

* Cross out due process as well. A portion of the military budget bill (NDAA) granted the President new executive powers to infinitely detain any citizen he deems a threat. But he was already targeting and killing American citizens abroad without any sort of a trial. Meanwhile those suspected of terrorism who do make it to trial find themselves indefensible as crucial evidence is withheld from their lawyers due to 'national security concerns'.

4) Russian media is now routinely reporting on America's oppression of freedom, rather than the other way around. In fact, one has to turn to RT.COM to get any coverage of this because our mainstream media blows it off. We FORGOT how hard we fought to see the Berlin Wall come down only to now build our own.

5) What Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists did was brilliant. I couldn't think of a better way to strike a blow to the gut (our economy) and the head (our minds) of a Goliath like the US. We FORGOT that because just because we were big we weren't infallible. We got sucker-punched with the greatest incident of psychological warfare ever perpetrated. And it worked. We laid down our freedoms in the name of safety much to the disgrace of all those who died that day.

If we really don't want to let the terrorists win, we must not FORGET the things that actually made this country great. Please join me in the fight for freedom.",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

* A majority of people actually do support invasive security measures. The minority is just very vocal.

I got a response from Mike Rogers, who claims that PRISM does not monitor communications of any U.S. citizen. But my understanding is that both pro- and anti-PRISM advocates all agree that U.S. citizens' data are being monitored (or at the very least collected), and the debate is whether warrants were obtained for these searches. Are pro-PRISM advocates now saying that no data from U.S. citizens are being collected at all? I have copied his response below. 


""Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding the protection of your Fourth Amendment rights. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
 
As chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), it is my responsibility to ensure strict and thorough congressional oversight of the important work done by America’s intelligence agencies. I have been disheartened by dangerous national security leaks that have grossly distorted two vital National Security Agency programs that have proved very effective in preventing terror attacks in the U.S. without infringing on Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.
 
At a time when the Obama administration’s IRS, Benghazi and Justice Department scandals have understandably damaged Americans’ trust in their government, it is important to understand why these programs are different. Neither program allows the NSA to read e-mails or listen to phone calls of American citizens. Both programs are constitutional and do not violate any American’s Fourth Amendment rights. Both are strictly overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a federal court created in 1978 to protect the rights of American citizens in the course of foreign intelligence gathering.
 
There are also several layers of checks and balances put in place around these programs within the executive branch and Congress. Both programs are overseen by lawyers and compliance auditors from the Department of Justice, the director of national intelligence and multiple independent inspectors general. Both have also been authorized by large bipartisan majorities in Congress and are regularly reviewed by the House and Senate intelligence committees. The effectiveness of these programs is without question. Both have produced vital intelligence that has prevented dozens of terrorist attacks within the U.S. and around the world.
 
The first program allows the NSA to preserve a limited category of business records to help identify foreign terrorists and their plots to attack the U.S. This court-authorized program allows NSA to preserve only phone records such as the numbers dialed and the date, time and duration of calls. These records do not include the names or personal information of any American and do not include any content of calls.
 
When the NSA wants to query the records, it must establish through a court-approved process that there is a reasonable suspicion a specific number is connected to a foreign terrorist. Only a limited number of analysts can obtain approval to conduct a narrow and targeted search of those numbers. If U.S. connections are found, they are passed to the FBI for further investigation. If the FBI wants to determine the identity of a phone number resulting from an NSA search, they must obtain a separate court order. These call record searches, which are regularly audited for compliance by all three branches of government, are a vital tool for connecting the dots between foreign terrorists plotting attacks in the U.S. and in other countries.
 
The second program, known as PRISM, allows the NSA to obtain a court order to access the electronic communications of suspected foreign terrorists overseas. Because much of the world’s Internet traffic flows through U.S. infrastructure, the law allows the NSA to obtain the specific communications of foreign suspects from U.S. companies with a court order. This program does not create a “back door” to any U.S. company’s server. This program cannot and does not monitor the communications of any U.S. citizens.
 
All 535 members of Congress have had access to classified briefings describing the specific uses of these two programs, though not all members have chosen to attend these briefings.
 
It is important to consider the source of the news media leaks about these two vital intelligence programs. These leaks came from a person not involved in the careful execution of these programs, and with access to only small pieces of a larger puzzle. He decided to break the law and the oath he took to the American people by publicly disclosing parts of these classified programs, and then fled to China. These are the actions of a felon, not a whistle-blower.
 
The effectiveness of these programs depends on them being kept secret from the foreign terrorists they target. It is much easier for terrorists to hide from us if they understand the sources and methods of our intelligence gathering. We have already seen al-Qaeda begin to shift their communication tactics as a result of these leaks, and it will now be much harder for us to find them.
 
It is no coincidence that the leaders from across the American political spectrum who take the time to understand these important programs are also their strongest supporters. They understand that these narrowly targeted programs are legal, do not invade Americans’ privacy rights, and are essential to detecting and disrupting future terrorist attacks.
 
 With regard to the program called XKeyscore, it is important to understand that this tool is not used in connection with the NSA’s receipt of metadata pursuant to Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The NSA may not use this tool to target a U.S. citizen without an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Further, the unauthorized disclosure of classified material about XKeyscore without the proper context only causes more confusion and harm to our national security.
 
As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee I take the privacy rights of Americans very seriously. That is why I believe in having a robust dialogue to address concerns expressed by the public and Members of Congress. Rest assured, I will continue reviewing potential changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to improve transparency, strengthen privacy protections, and further build the confidence of the American public while ensuring that our Intelligence Community retains the tools it needs to protect our nation. For a link to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on the issue, please click here: http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/313429-1. 
 
Again, thank you for contacting me. Please feel free to contact me in the future should you have additional questions or concerns.
 
 Sincerely,
Mike Rogers""

If the NSA is stopped from looking at our phones metadata, or other forms of electronic communication.

What would they see for me?

They won't find any kiddie porn sites, or anything really illegal from these taps so I wouldn't be worried. My privacy would feel violated as they want to catch me physically breaking the law in the privacy of my own home. Which they wouldn't since all my built in webcams are blocked with bandaids and ducttape. Can't say the same thing for built in microphones, but wouldn't arresting me based on what I say in my own home also be a violation of the first amendment? Which protects my right to speak out against the government.

Please don't get me wrong, these actions are against the constitutional amendment that outlines the government needing a warrant to gain access to a personal domicile. Computer use should be a part of that. Then again look at what the politicians used prior to the civil war to used to justify slavery, suppressing the female vote, and the acts of genocide committed towards the Native American population from since we were colonies to almost the 20th century. It was all by them twisting words that were written. Is it really suprising that this is happening? Would it be surprising that even if a law that stops the NSA from doing what they are doing, they would find away around it because of a technical loophole that exists in the verbage that such a law banning the NSA from illegal digital wiretaps.

68,Are the recent (potentially NSA mediated) law enforcement operations against Freedom Press and Lavabit connected to Snowden?,33.0,1k0m4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1k0m4e/are_the_recent_potentially_nsa_mediated_law/,13.0,1376040130.0,"We know that Snowden is now in a Russian government controlled safe house, with very limited ability to communicate. We also know that he is in daily contact with Greenwald, somehow, securely. He was reported in the past as using Lavabit as a secure email provider. I think it is a fair bet to assume he is being heavily surveilled by multiple parties. In such a situation he is probably using encrypted communication tools of some sort. 


The recent pressure on Freedom Press and Lavabit seem to have originated simultaneously. The former was taken out by surprise last week by a combined technological and law enforcement attack. The latter was probably set in motion some short time ago, in the form of a gag order on the owner of Lavabit. We know he said he agonized over the decision to burn everything down, so the timeframes do seem to overlap to some degree.

In addition it was clear that an older version of the Tor browser bundle was specifically attacked by the malware attack used against Freedom Hosting users, plus Tormail specifically was taken completely offline. To be fair Tormail is notoriously unreliable anyway, but it honestly does seem as if there is a pattern to these shutdowns, and the common thread is Snowden and the NSA.

Honestly this is all total speculation, but as (forgot the name)'s recent tweet today indicates - others agree. 


I think the most likely explanation is one of 2 things:

1. The NSA and related authorities are taking out high value targets while they still have the power and political capital to do so before potential reforms kick in after the current congressional recess. However these moves don't seem high value enough to be honest, and the media reaction has been largely suspicious and negative - especially with the Lavabit statement, which implied that they got no value from their demands there. Their political situation has been made weaker with these actions, and there clearly needs to have been a justification for it all.

2. For some reason they are trying to cut off Snowden from those he is in contact with outside Russia. That or they have recently uncovered evidence that he uses Tormail and/or Lavabit and wish to uncover what exactly he has been telling people. I suspect they will have access to Tormail server data soon if not already as pressure on the CEO of Freedom Hosting mounts in Ireland.

2.5. Moving into the realm of crackpottery here but Snowden is now in an incredibly vulnerable position. He may not have a clear line of contact to any of the press anymore, especially with the takedown of these popular encrypted services. He is not in a crowded airport, and is most likely in a relatively remote location, surrounded by state operatives. The Wikileaks handler's situation is unknown as well. Greenwald revealed recently that he received tens of thousands of leaked documents but importantly, only he and Poitras were given access. There have been persistent rumors of a dead mans switch but nothing definitive, as far as I can recall it may have stemmed from Greenwald's assertion that Snowden had ""taken measures"" to protect himself. I think this whole sequence of events is ominous; it is the perfect moment for a transfer of Snowden to somewhere he won't be able to communicate to the public from, or where his actions will become involuntary. I'm not talking about a commando raid, more on the scale of a quiet prisoner transfer  to agents that operate outside the public eye.


Anyway this got too long, what do you think of it all?

EDIT: Correction - Lavabit's CEO Levison said he was struggling with the decision for ""6 weeks"".

EDIT: should be ""Freedom Hosting"", my mistake, was late. I'm going to start including elaborations and more pertinent info in bullet form below.

* The warrant for Marques's  (CEO of Freedom Hosting) arrest was issued from Maryland and apparently was the culmination of a year long collaboration between Irish and American law enforcement.
* Snowden was quoted by Greenwald in a new article this morning, and the quote was meant to be from the same day and directly addressed Lavabit, so clearly they are still able to communicate. ",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

At a certain point, they basically concluded that the programs were legal because we were in ""Emergency Circumstances"" following 911, and nobody wanted another one to happen. Only problem being, these ""Emergency Circumstances"" never ended, and now it seems they've become policy. 

So my question, is if even lawyers working for the administration believed that there were unconstitutional violations taking place, and some even stepped down, this would lead me to believe there was at least some reasonable doubt that what they were going forward with was completely legal.

If one's worldview is that government if fundamentally corrupt and likely so spy on you and yours, then any any suggestion that that might indeed be happening, will be accepted without scrutiny.


I am just as susceptible as the next guy to this phenomenon which is why, when 'scandals' break, I tend to wait a few days before I start to read some of the coverage.   I don't want Glenn Greenwald forming my opinion for me. (Greenwald has been around a long time and has in that long time, always had an agenda--an agenda I agree with for the most part, but one that he supports with hyperbole and poorly sourced fact, at times).


At this point, all we know is that the government was using data supplied from some of the big internet companies.  There is no evidence that this data was collected illegally. There has been some conversation that the NSA could be reading these words as I type them *waves to the NSA agent*.  While I have no doubt this is true, I have plenty of skepticism that the NSA is doing such without an explicit warrant.  Two reasons: first, I'm an American citizen and second, consider the whistle blowers.  If the government was really listening in to people's phone calls without warrant, reading their emails without court approval, why hasn't it come to light?  Is it a cover-up?  Considering the amount of internet rage this week, it's a pretty piss poor cover-up.  


And then you look at how the WP has changed its reporting and then you look at the language that clearly shows Greenwald speculating, and you have the recipe for a scandal that isn't quite as scandalous as promise. 


That is not to say that privacy in a digital age isn't an important issue to discuss--it is.  After 9/11 I was horrified to watch the Patriot Act passed so quickly and was increasingly concerned at the scope of government power.  But to assert that the government has gone beyond what is legal (or even beyond what governments have been doing since the first radio communication was transmitted) is little more than idle speculation at this point.

Video: http://www.mediaite.com/online/watch-live-obama-to-recast-u-s-foreign-policy-in-west-point-address/

>So, let me spend the rest of my time describing my vision for how
the United States of America, and our military, should lead in the
years to come, for you will be part of that leadership...

While he certainly has a fair bit to say before and after that mark, both the President [and Pundits seem to be trumpeting his speech as a turn](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/obama-west-point-foreign-policy/index.html) in American foreign policy. This seems to me to be a great place to start when reviewing the speech.

>First, let me repeat a principle I put forward at the
outset of my presidency: the United States will use military force,
unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it, when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the
security of our allies is in danger.

This seems to be very much the position of every presidency to me. Does it differ from Bush or before?

>For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism. But a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is naive and unsustainable. I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy, drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold.

I'm not sure why the President is not trumpeting Libya as a success or failure to learn from here. In fact, he really doesn't mention the 2011 military engagement with Libya that lasted 9 months and had [10,000 sorties and toppled the government there at all in this speech.](http://world.time.com/2012/05/16/how-many-innocent-civilians-did-nato-kill-in-libya/) But again, I don't really see how this idea is unique or different to US policy. We have always sought allies and always will.

>And the need for a new strategy reflects the fact that today's
principal threat no longer comes from a centralized Al Qaida
leadership. Instead, it comes from decentralized Al Qaida affiliates
and extremists, many with agendas focused in countries where they
operate. And this lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style
attacks against the homeland, but it heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi. 

I'm not sure why the ""decentralized al qaida"" would be unable to mount another 9/11 style incident. That plot used 20+ people. And again... the president isn't mentioning that the attack in Benghazi that happened in 2012 occurred after the US, France and UK bombed Libya and destabilized it... He seems to be referring to it as if the US had nothing to do with the state of affairs in Libya at that point. To me, it has long been obvious that the issue he is talking about occurred because the US did not learn from the lessons of training and rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan and instead they left Libya without committing to any re-building. The result has been a long slide into a militia run country and has only grown worse over time. This seems to me to be the only moment he refers to Libya at all in the speech.

>So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse
threat, one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch
our military too thin or stir up local resentments. We need partners
to fight terrorists along-side us. And empowering partners is a large
part of what we have done and what we are currently doing in
Afghanistan.

This certainly makes sense, and is a traditional argument for all presidencies really. Why [was there an exception to this rule in Syria](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/politics/us-syria/) when the president argued for unilateral missile strikes?

>But sustaining this progress depends on the ability of Afghans to
do the job. And that's why we trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan
soldiers and police. Earlier this spring, those forces, those Afghan
forces, secured an election in which Afghans voted for the first
democratic transfer of power in their history. 

If this was so important, why was it not done in Libya?

>A critical focus of this effort will be the ongoing
crisis in Syria. As frustrating as it is, there are no easy answers
there. No military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering
any time soon.

This seems to contradict the president from a year ago in that he felt a military solution was worth a ""limited strike"".

>Let me make one final point about our efforts against terrorism.
The partnerships I described do not eliminate the need to take direct
action, when necessary, to protect ourselves. When we have actionable intelligence, that's what we do

I couldn't agree with the President more, and this sounds much the same as the Bush Doctrine.

>but as I said last year, in taking direct action, we must uphold standards that reflect our values. That means taking strikes only when we face a continuing, imminent threat, and only where there is no certainty -- where there is near certainty of no civilian casualties. For our actions should meet a simple test: we must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield.

Again, I would argue that this simple test has not been met by the way the Obama Administration left Libya. Or the way drone strikes work for that matter.

>And this issue of transparency is directly relevant to a third aspect of American leadership, and that is our effort to strengthen and enforce international order.

This has been an argument from the Administration from day 1, I think. It is certainly a sensible argument- However ""transparency"" in the days of Snowden and NSA wire taps and Drone bombing and IRS scandals seems to have a different meaning.

The president went on to talk about Russia and Ukraine, Iran and ends

>America does not simply stand for stability or the absence of
conflict no matter what the cost. We stand for the more lasting peace
that can only come through opportunity and freedom for people
everywhere.Which brings me to the fourth and final element of American leadership -- our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity.

This again rings hollow for me because of what was done in Libya, and also Syria, and Egypt during this administration. We very specifically do not commit to rebuilding or any ground troops because of the cost, and today [the US government is telling it's citizens in Libya to leave the country because it is too unstable.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27599301). The entire argument for entering Libya was to protect civilians and ""act on behalf of human dignity."" - but in the end we armed 1700 militias and left as soon as we saw evidence of Gadaffi's death. In Egypt, the President himself announced that he asked [Mubarrak to step down](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/02/04/obama-administration-urges-mubarak-to-step-down) and since then Egypt has been involved in a coup after coup. Syria's situation is far worse now than it was when it started 3 years ago, and still worse than it was a year ago when the administration publicly threatened attacks but took no action.

While much of the rhetoric seems to be in agreement with my views, I don't see where the actions hold up. It also seems to me like the majority of the rehtoric is not new at all, and exactly something Bush would outline as the ""Bush Doctrine"".

I would essentially be ripping off honest traders and investors who bet against me.

I’d like to present Snowden’s decision to release classified NSA documents through the lens of human morality. Most importantly, I’d like to frame this discussion within Lawrence Kohlberg’s stages of moral development, so if you are not already familiar with Kohlberg’s work, please [read this carefully](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development#Heinz_dilemma).

From what I have read in the media, the argument made for Snowden as a traitor is grounded in Conventional Stage Four Reasoning

*In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would — thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force*

However, recent verification that Snowden did actually [attempt to go through channels at the NSA before going to the press](http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2014/05/29/nbc-news-confirms-attempt-by-edward-snowden-to-go-through-channels-at-nsa/#.U4dddv621Fs.reddit) allows us to take on a higher level of moral judgment, as expressed in Post Conventional moral methodology.  To take that a step further, since there is no record of anyone being harmed or killed due to the ongoing release of documents, a strong case can be made that Snowden’s actions are absolutely morally defensible based on  Post Conventional Stage Six Reasoning

*In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon.*

Suppose a new revelation about the NSA comes out, and I ask someone about that and they give me that same response. How can I demonstrate that we DIDN'T know about this new information until now?

I think the waters have been muddled significantly about what the NSA is and is not doing, and so people are able to 'crawl beneath the fence' so to speak and claim that we already knew X or Y was happening. And then I realized, perhaps the question ""What ISN'T the NSA doing?"" is far more important than ""What is the NSA doing?""

Perhaps in ascertaining that, if people respond to future revelations about the NSA with claims that we already knew that, we can effectively demonstrate that that is not the case.

<analogy>

Of course, we knew they had this technology to watch terrorists, but they developed some special capabilities to install them very scalably (completely surreptitiously) and store, process, and search the huge amounts of footage.  Installing them in every home--both inside and outside the US--was understandably irresistible, since it would be an invaluable tool for finding terrorists.

While some people suspected they were doing this for a long time, there was never any definitive proof.  Some senators were upset that the NSA would dare to put all these cameras in people's homes without public discussion, but they didn't feel they could expose the program themselves.  They tried to get the NSA director to admit there were cameras in everyone's homes, but he denied it flat out while under oath.  The president publicly says, ""nobody is watching you inside your house.""

Then someone leaked information indicating that there were in fact NSA cameras in everyone's homes.

The media and public are outraged.  Everyone feels an intuitive sense of violation.

The president tries to mitigate the damage by saying that nobody is *actually* watching you--they admit all the video is recorded and stored, but the government can only watch the footage with a warrant (though perhaps there's also some software that is constantly scanning for suspicious activity and can flag you for human review even without a warrant--the details are a bit hazy).

Anyway, this only enrages the public even more.

You see, people immediately realize that even if nobody is watching the video, the capture and storage of the video is outrageously intrusive.  

Can we trust that the government won't abuse your footage? (especially after they lied about the cameras in the first place)  

Can we trust that individual employees and contractors won't abuse your footage?  (after all, one of them leaked the information, so how good are their internal controls and hiring processes?)  

Can we trust that they can keep this footage safe from outsiders (criminals, foreign govts, etc.) who would love to break into this treasure trove of sensitive data?

What is the cost/benefit analysis?  Terrorists already assumed they had cameras in their homes, so they always tried to do their planning and meeting in other places.  Maybe sometimes someone would slip up and get caught, but most of the time the serious ones are flying under the radar.  In the mean time, the entire rest of humanity is operating under the assumption that basic human decency would be respected, and that nobody would install a camera in their homes without well-supported cause.  We were wrong.

</analogy>

So you may say, cameras inside your home are much more intrusive than all of your telephone and internet activity?  I'd argue the exact opposite.  Someone watching footage of the inside of my house would learn relatively little about me compared to analyzing my electronic communications: every person I talk to, every person I email, every website I visit, everything I search for, *every place I go* (with my smartphone).  Maybe no single data point is particularly revealing, but if you piece it all together, there's simply no comparison.  (Go ahead, record what I eat for breakfast and what pajamas I wear.)

Or you may say, in the real world they're only tracking your metadata, not the content of your communications.  We don't know that for sure, but we do know that once they've tapped into everything, their instincts and incentives will be to vacuum up as much data as they are able to store and process and worry about the details later.

Going back to the analogy of the cameras, would you feel much better knowing that cameras are recording only low-resolution video?  Probably not.  How about knowing that with the mere change of software configuration, the video could be changed to count the hairs on your nose?

...

This analogy is simply meant to make it easier for non-technical people to realize what more tech-savvy people immediately know: that the level of intrusiveness *in what we already know* the NSA to be doing is patently unacceptable and cannot be done without great harm to innocents, even if not to myself personally.  

This doesn't even begin to address the equally disturbing fact that this was done without our informed consent (in fact, we were actively misled), and that the NSA's secrecy serves little operational benefit, except that the program wouldn't survive a truly democratic review in the first place.",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

I found this source while writing a report on the War on Terror for college. The information states that terrorism has significantly decreased since 2001. 
> The frequency of terrorist attacks in the United 
States has decreased since 2001.

It also shows how significant the number of attacks have dropped.

> From 1991-2000, the United States averaged 
41.3 terrorist attacks per year.1 After 2001, the 
average number of US attacks decreased to 16 
per year from 2002-2010

If you read further, you will see that a graph showing how Global terrorist attacks has dropped around 2001 and then risen to original 1970s numbers in roughly 2006, but the countries that have experienced the most attacks have shifted to middle eastern countries. Iraq is number one in terrorist attacks. Which suggests that the only reason it has risen is due to American forces being in Iraq and Afghanistan. 


My point with all this is that although we all hate the NSA for spying on us. The number of terrorist attacks we have experienced have significantly gone done. So are their actions justified in some way? or at least the actions of any of the other anti-terrorist offices in the US?

105,I Propose A Whistleblower Amendment,19.0,1hrrll,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hrrll/i_propose_a_whistleblower_amendment/,41.0,1373149242.0,"**Why I wrote this:**

I found myself wondering what the government WOULD want a citizen to do if he/she possessed classified information that possibly indicated unconstitutional practices...it’s not like you can go to your local police department and say, “I’ve got some killer info on the NSA...”

I finally had a thought: Why not make the states’ attorneys general the receptacles in which whistleblowers can deposit information on federal government behaviour? This way it doesn’t go to the media, but doesn’t get swept under the rug either.

**Why I like it:**

*It provides states with an oversight role to the federal government.

*It improves the democratic process at the federal level, as many AGs are popularly elected officials, therefore making oversight a more inclusive process.

*It would repurpose/expand the offices/responsibilities of existing officials (the attorneys general) instead of just creating new ones.

Providing oversight power to the states is an incentive that ⅔ of the state legislatures might jump at, regardless of party affiliation.

*I wrote it.

**Some things to know about me:**

*I’m an idiot.

*I don’t think this is sacred/inspired/brilliant/etc- feel free to trash its virtues. It’s just an idea.

*I’m posting this in hopes that perhaps a scrap of it could be taken by someone with experience/knowledge/resources and made better.


**With those things in mind, I give you, Reddit, my proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:**


The attorneys general of the states, individually and collectively, shall be the appropriate jurisdiction to report federal government corruption, crime, malfeasance, or negligence. The attorneys general are hereby endowed with the authority to receive, investigate, and, collectively, issue criminal indictment or file a civil suit in complaint matters offered to them by any United States Citizen in relation to any branch or agency of the United States Federal Government.

 No citizen shall be prosecuted for any information, data, or documents relayed or delivered to the duly-elected or appointed attorney general of any of the states, regardless of said documents’ or information’s classified or secret status. Any complainant is hereby guaranteed the right to anonymity.

Any duly-elected or appointed Attorney General of any of the states is hereby guaranteed temporary, circumstantial clearance up to the necessary requirement and and level, to review any classified documents or material for the explicit means of investigating a complaint.

All indictments and suits shall be made public.


**Hypothetical Process:**

**Complaint**

Whistleblower/complainant obtains information/documents which indicate an unconstitutional practice, corruption, or law-breaking by a branch, agency, or employee of the federal government. He/she delivers this information (anonymously if she/she desires) to the attorney general of any of the states. The attorney general reviews the information.

**Motion to Investigate**

If the attorney general feels that there is probable cause that a law has been broken, he/she will share the information with the other 47 attorneys general, including a Motion to Investigate (MI). If a second and third state attorneys general formally agree to an investigation, they return to him/her an Affidavit of Concurrence (AC)  for the investigation. All attorneys general can return an AC, but only two are required for the process to continue.

**Senate Judiciary Committee**

The attorney general who received the original complaint delivers his MI to the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC), along with the ACs from any other attorneys general who have delivered them to him/her. The SJC can decline the investigation with a unanimous vote. However, if one committee member votes for the investigation to proceed it will proceed. In the event that a member of the SJC is named as a potential target of the MI, the vote will be transferred to the House Judiciary Committee with identical voting rules. 

With at least one vote from the committee, a Prosecutorial Committee (PC) is established consisting of the attorney general who received the complaint and two other states attorneys general to be selected by the SJC. The PC is extended the subpoena power of the SJC, as well as a temporary, circumstantial clearance to review any secret documents related to the investigation.

**Investigation and Filing**

The collective states attorneys general become the Determinant Voting Body (DVB) for the investigation, once the investigation is completed. The PC presents to the DVB its findings. The DVB votes on whether an indictment, suit, or request for injunction is filed, by majority rule. Once filed, the suit will navigate through the established channels of the federal court system, civil or criminal.

If criminal activity is revealed as part of the PC’s investigation, the DVB shall act as a federal grand jury and if the majority vote to indict on criminal charges, an indictment is filed against the accused party in the federal court jurisdiction in which the investigation originated. In both civil or criminal cases, the PC maintains the right to prosecute the case itself or turn it over to a federal prosecutor.

**As example, below is hypothetically how the process might have worked in the Snowden situation:**

**Complaint.**

*Mr. Snowden, while working as a contractor for the NSA, comes across information and documents that appear to violate the 4th ammendment of the United States Constitution. Instead of leaking the information to the media, Mr. Snowden contacts the Attorney General’s office of the state of Kentucky (although it’s not his or his boss’ home state) and arranges to transfer the documents.*

**The Motion.**

*Mr. Madeupname, the Attorney General of the State of Kentucky, reviews the material, and feels that it is indeed likely that the constitution is being violated and criminal activity has taken place. He authors a Motion to Investigate (MI), delivering said motion to the remaining 49 attorneys general of each state. After reviewing the material, Mr. Mynameisfake (of Rhode Island), and Mrs. Namesareoverrated (of Nevada) second and third the motion, respectively, each delivering an Affidavit of Concurrence (AC) to Mr. Madeupname. The motion, along with the ACs, is delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee.*

**Senate Judiciary Committee.**

*The Senate Judiciary Committee reviews the MI, ACs, as well as the statement/documents from the complainant before holding a vote. Two senators vote in favor of the investigation. The committee selects two states attorneys general to assist Mr. Madeupname in his investigation, forming the Prosecutorial Committee (PC). They thereby grant Mr. Madeupname, and his committee, a circumstantial security clearance authorization and extend to them the committee’s subpoena power.*


**Investigation and Indictment/Suit.**

*Using the its subpoena power and clearance level, the PC investigates Snowden’s complaint. They find evidence of mass surveillance and unconstitutional invasions of privacy, and share their findings with with remaining 47 states attorneys general, who now constitute the Determinant Voting Body (DVB) for the purpose of filing suit for an injunction. The DVB votes 37-10 in favor of filing for an injunction against the NSA’s surveillance practices. Suit is filed in the United States District Court, District of Eastern Kentucky as Kentucky v. NSA.*

**Result**

*The NSA loses, but appeals, with the case eventually coming before the Supreme Court for a definitive decision. The release of sensitive information is controlled by a federal judge, limiting the national security damage that could result from a full disclosure. Snowden’s identity is never revealed and he keeps living the good life in Hawaii with his stripper girlfriend and his GED framed on the wall.*


**TL;DR** A proposed amendment to establish a process by which any conscientious whistleblower could share his/her information and convert his/her state’s (or any other’s) attorney general into a special prosecutor on the matter.

108,E-Mail I Received From Sen. Dianna Feinstein In Response To NSA Surveillance Programs,18.0,1ilnv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ilnv8/email_i_received_from_sen_dianna_feinstein_in/,16.0,1374196477.0,"Dear John Benjamin: 
  
I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond.  
  
First, I understand your concerns and want to point out that by law, the government cannot listen to an American's telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause.  As is described in the attachment to this letter provided by the Executive Branch, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary. 
  
As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that I believe the oversight we have conducted is strong and effective and I am doing my level best to get more information declassified.  Please know that it is equally frustrating to me, as it is to you, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights. 
  
These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, their activities, and those associated with terrorist plots, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming. 
  
• On June 18, 2003, the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified to the House Intelligence Committee that there have been ""over 50 potential terrorist events"" that these programs helped prevent.  
  
• While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified, I have reviewed the classified testimony and reports from the Executive Branch that describe in detail how this surveillance has stopped attacks.  
  
• Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates.  
  
• Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, the NSA has determined that in early September of 2009, while monitoring the activities of Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based Najibullah Zazi.  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks. Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested. Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system.  
  
• Regarding terrorist David Headley, he was also involved in the planning and reconnaissance of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India that killed 166 people, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, at the behest of Al Qaeda.  
  
Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but laws passed and enacted since 9/11 specifically authorize them.  The surveillance programs are authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which itself was enacted by Congress in 1978 to establish the legal structure to carry out these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans.  
  
The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, the phone call business record program was reauthorized most recently on May 26, 2011 by a vote of 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House.  The internet communications program was reauthorized most recently on December 30, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House.  
  
Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity, I believe it is important to ensure that the public record now available on these programs is accurate and provided with the proper context. 
  
Again, thank you for contacting me with your concerns and comments.  I appreciate knowing your views and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.

As you know, these leaks revealed the existence of NSA programs aimed at intercepting call and email data to target and prevent potential terror plots. While many people are understandably concerned about the scope and methods of these programs, these programs strictly prohibit warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens within the bounds of current U.S. law.  For example, each and every request to begin surveillance on any person in the United States requires a particularized warrant request submitted to and approved by an independent Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) court judge. 

In a post-September 11th era, the work of the intelligence community has been critical in thwarting potential terror plots. Importantly, this effort requires gathering information to identify terrorists and stop attacks before they occur, not after it's too late.  At the same time, the intelligence community is constrained by important checks and balances that prevent abuse and overreach. Furthermore, the NSA has publicly revealed steps they take to minimize the retention of irrelevant data including phone logs that are destroyed after five years.

Maintaining the balance between our civil liberties and our national security is a responsibility I take very seriously.  I will continue to keep a close eye on these programs and will never support any policy that I believe threatens the constitutional rights of the American people.

----------

Thank you for contacting me regarding intelligence gathering activities at the National Security Agency (NSA).  I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue, and I welcome the opportunity to respond.

As you may know, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a framework for the government to obtain judicial approval to conduct wiretapping or searches or to otherwise access records while gathering foreign intelligence information.  In 2008, I supported an effort to modernize the then 30-year-old FISA in order to allow us to effectively monitor terrorist communications overseas.  At the same time, I recognized the privacy concerns that many Missourians had regarding these new provisions.  That is why I voted in favor of several measures that would protect our national security without violating the constitutionally protected privacy rights and civil liberties of law-abiding Americans.  These included requiring the government to obtain a warrant whenever the target of surveillance is a U.S. citizen and bolstering the authority of the FISA courts to oversee the eavesdropping activities of the National Security Agency.

On June 5, 2013, the British newspaper, The Guardian, published a classified FISA court order directing Verizon Wireless to provide the NSA with telephone records of Verizon Business Network Services customers.  In addition, national intelligence officials have confirmed the existence of a program within the NSA aimed at collecting information on foreigners overseas from the nation's largest Internet companies.  Both of these programs are consistent with current law.
Threats to our nation's security are real, and there are terrorist organizations around the world who actively seek to harm or damage the United States and her citizens.  We must be vigilant in ensuring that our country remains strong and effective in our response.  To that end, we need to make sure that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks and keep America safe.

At the same time, we must ensure that those in our government who have been entrusted to handle some of our nation's most highly-classified national security information are upholding their oaths to do so.  I am a strong proponent of accountability within government, and there are appropriate and legal avenues available to individuals who have concerns about classified programs and information.  However, it is important to remember that we are looking for balance between our intelligence gathering being effective and our intelligence gathering being transparent.  Classified information that is improperly disclosed can do real harm to our national security and could risk the lives of American citizens.  In June, 2013, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight, I co-chaired a hearing examining the vetting process used for federal employees and contractors who have access to sensitive information.  There are some clear gaps in the current system, and I will continue my work to ensure these processes are effectively catching those who cannot be trusted with access to classified information.

We all agree that intelligence gathering tools must be consistent with American values, and all intelligence-gathering activities must be done within the constraints of the law.  All laws, including FISA, must pass constitutional muster.  Please know that I will continue to monitor this matter to ensure that we gather intelligence in a manner that strikes the right balance between advancing our national security interests, keeping Americans safe from terrorist attacks, and protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.

Again, thank you for contacting me. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of further assistance to you on this or any other issue.

This is the response I just got from my senator (CT).,16.0,1igp6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1igp6l/i_filled_out_an_online_petition_against_the_nsa/,20.0,1374033183.0,"Thank you for contacting me regarding recent reports of alleged improper actions by members of the Obama administration.

I have been hearing from many of my constituents, like you, every day, voicing their frustration with a number of improprieties that members of the Obama administration have allegedly taken over the course of the last several years. These reports deal with a range of issues important to our country, and I appreciate your correspondence and the opportunity to address your concerns.

First, it has become clear that the IRS improperly targeted and unfairly scrutinized the tax filings of certain political groups. I believe that political targeting of any group or individual is an outrageous abuse of power whether it be by the IRS or any other federal agency, and I agree that this incident must be investigated promptly. Also, like you, I am concerned by actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to obtain the telephone records of reporters and editors at the Associated Press and other news organizations. The DOJ is charged with upholding our laws and helping to keep the American people safe; these actions raise serious questions about whether the appropriate balance has been struck between the desire to prevent the release of classified information and the need to protect the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press. Please be assured that I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to make sure that those responsible for improper incidents are held accountable.

Second, it was recently reported that the National Security Administration (NSA) requested the phone records for millions of Verizon customers in the United States, and through a program known as ""PRISM"" tapped into the servers of several major online entities, including Google and Facebook, to intercept communications as part of alleged terrorism investigations. Though the NSA argues the programs are legal under laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Patriot Act, many Americans have understandably voiced their concern that the NSA's actions unnecessarily infringe upon the civil liberties of our citizens. I find the data collection by the NSA troubling, particularly given its apparent enormous scale. While we need to be diligent about strengthening our national security, I've always been skeptical of government overreach into private lives. During my time in the U.S. House of Representatives, I voted against measures that expanded this type of data collection in an effort to protect the privacy of individuals in Connecticut and across the country. I'm increasingly concerned that Congress and the American public have not been able to appropriately debate the trade off between security and privacy in our fight against terrorism, because too many of our efforts are being conducted in a covert manner. I am working with my colleagues and members of the administration to gain a better understanding of what information is being collected and why, and whether additional oversight mechanisms need to be put in place.

Finally, as you are aware, on September 11, 2012, the U.S. Ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in a horrific terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Stevens, a former Peace Corps volunteer, was dedicated to helping the Libyan people build a better, more democratic future. I condemn the attack on American diplomats in Benghazi in the strongest terms. These attacks cannot be tolerated and those responsible should immediately be brought to justice. Furthermore, we must improve our systems in order to ensure that these types of attempted attacks are thwarted in the future.

During a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that I participated in, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified regarding the Benghazi attack, and detailed the findings of the independent Accountability Review Board (ARB) that was convened in its aftermath. The State Department has already implemented several of the ARB recommendations, but it is clear that we must do more to address the systemic deficiencies that have been identified to improve the safety of American officials abroad. I recently cosponsored a bipartisan measure in the Senate to provide more funds for embassy security upgrades, and I will to continue to advocate for adequate resources to support and protect the members of our Foreign Service as they work to promote peace and democracy overseas. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as we continue to respond to these national security challenges and support our nation's diplomatic efforts.

As new reports shed additional light on these incidents, please know that my overriding priority as a United States Senator is to work for the good of the country, rather than a party or special interest group, and to ensure that the constitutional rights of all Americans are respected and upheld. As I continue to monitor developments and work with my colleagues in the Senate to investigate and find solutions, please be assured I will keep your comments in mind.

Thank you again for contacting me about this matter.  I appreciate hearing from you and assure you that I will always do my best to represent the views of my constituents in the Senate.  In the future, please do not hesitate to call me in my Connecticut office at (860) 549-8463 or my Washington office at (202) 224-4041.

Ostensibly this is done to protect the highest intelligence as well as methods and sources of said intelligence, particularly when sources could be jeopardized if those secrets got out.

Paul, and others criticize this as undemocratic. A similar outcry arose in the case of the NSA warrantless surveillance program, which affected American citizens which many believe didn’t have proper congressional oversight.

Is limiting such information to only these high-ranking officials provide enough oversight? Or would it be prudent to extend those briefings to full membership of the intelligence committees, or even the full house/senate as Paul suggests?

121,"Richard Clarke claims, ""Every expert I know believes that NSA could crack,"" Syed Farook's iPhone.",15.0,4ae86z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4ae86z/richard_clarke_claims_every_expert_i_know/,74.0,1457978416.0,"He goes on to say, ""they [the FBI] are not as interested in solving the problem as they are in getting a legal precedent,"" in [an interview with NPR](http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=470347719&m=470347720)

In a [Senate Judiciary Committee hearing](https://youtu.be/1ThJHxBtZmY?t=2m53s) before Darrell Issa, FBI director James Comey claims, ""We wouldn't be litigating if we could [crack the phone]. We have engaged all parts of the U.S. government to see, does anybody have a way, short of asking Apple to do it, with a 5c running iOS 9, to do this, and we do not.""

Interestingly, immediately following that statement in the same Hearing, Comey is (maybe understandably) utterly befuddled by Issa's questions regarding possible tactics in attacking the Farook's phone, Issa previously having been in the digital security business.  Comey later admits he's not sure he ""fully even understands the questions.""

I'm wondering: is it possible, if Richard Clarke is right and the NSA is absolutely capable of cracking this phone, that James Comey would actually lie under oath in claiming that he's worked with ""all parts of the U.S. government,"" prior to seeking legal action?  

Is it remotely possible that he would be unaware that the FBI is more interested in seeking legal precedent than cracking the phone, in the same way he might not be aware of the particular tactics his team has used?

Do you think the NSA or the FBI should be/would be capable of cracking this phone, if they really wanted to?

To be clear, I don't find the repercussions of James Comey lying under oath that interesting (although they would be pretty interesting) -- I'm more struck by the possibility of a huge scandal here, now that Apple is so adamantly refusing to cooperate.  I mean, if the FBI trying to pull the wool over our eyes, for appearance's sake I think James Comey could have at least been *a little more prepared* for Darrell Issa's questions, even just had a technical professional with him, which is certainly common in these types of hearings.

122,"With respect to Syria, why are so many people opposed to intervention now embracing public opinion polls?",14.0,1m2u21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1m2u21/with_respect_to_syria_why_are_so_many_people/,26.0,1378779820.0,"Personally, I'm still on the fence about whether or not the U.S. should intervene in Syria and I can see both sides of the argument as to why we should or should not get involved.  
  
What really bothers me though, is that on this particular forum (Reddit), a good deal of the posts are about how a majority of Americans are opposed to getting involved in Syria, thus we shouldn't get involved. While I generally agree that the actions of our government should align with the will of the people, I feel like there have been instances in the past where that hasn't been the case and it has turned out to be for the better. Further, some people seem to be holding up public opinion as infallible while only months ago they would decry the public for not being outraged at things like NSA data collection. I remember when all the NSA stuff was first coming to light, public opinion polls about it were pretty split on whether people thought the NSA was acting within its appropriate powers. When I mentioned this to those ardently against the NSA, they'd often reply that the American people were just ""ignorant of the real issues"" or ""too busy watching Jersey Shore to really know the gravity of the situation"". Now that public opinion conveniently lines up on the sides of these same individuals, most of them are taking that as de facto evidence that they must be right. It just seems all sort of flimsy to use that as an argument to me. 
  
Additionally, to go back and reinforce my first point, I feel that history has shown that the majority can at times be wrong. When Truman signed an executive order in 1948 ending segregation in the military, there was a strong public opinion in favor keeping segregation, yet it turned out to be the right thing to do.

123,Our Spying Scandal - The difference between a good nation and a bad nation.,14.0,1k14eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1k14eb/our_spying_scandal_the_difference_between_a_good/,7.0,1376062816.0,"Let me share a story that illustrates the difference between a good nation and a bad nation.

In Liberia, we get pulled over by cops all the time who are shaking us down for money. We give them the money rather than find our way to a dilapidated Liberian prison. The corrupt police even set up roadblocks between the capital city and the airport to shake down all foreigners leaving the country. We found ourselves in that situation too.

In Detroit, a few weeks ago, cops were shaking down citizens. But the response was different by the authorities than the response in Liberia.

In Liberia, the cops, if they are discovered, just pay a bribe. In Detroit, the two corrupt cops are being arrested and prosecuted.

We can say with the technology that we have and will improve upon that spying is going to happen. That is true. Spying can't be stopped. Just like corrupt police officers shaking down citizens will always be among us. But that doesn't mean we have to make it legal. A healthy nation fights against corruption rather than just accept corruption as the normal operation procedure.

The difference between a good nation and a bad nation is that corruption and abuses of power will not be allowed. Just saying that it will happen does not mean that we have to say that the behavior should be legal. If a government agent is abusing his power, then it should be prosecuted. We should not just allow corruption and abuse of power to be acceptable behavior. 

Now, we can say that we have nothing to hide.

Barry Eisler gave a better response to this than I could come up with. 

""A Facebook reader assures me regarding the NSA program, ""If you are doing the right thing and minding your own business you have nothing to hide.""  I know I'm being naive, but I can't stop being amazed when Americans blithely spout statements like this one, which would be perfectly at home in the North Korean Politburo or in 1984.  As I said in response:

""It's not a question of having something or nothing to hide.  If you were at a dinner party and someone took out a dictaphone and said he just wanted to record the conversation so he could listen to it later, what sort of impact do you think this would have on people's behavior?  Now, what sort of impact do you think there will be on the creativity, spontaneity, amount of dissent, and other aspects of the free flow of information that are critical to the healthy functioning of a free society if people have reason to believe the government is monitoring everything?

""If the framers had wanted the government to have a free rein surveilling the populace because 'if you are doing the right thing and minding your own business you have nothing to hide,' we wouldn't have or need a Fourth Amendment.  But we do -- unless you would prefer to abolish it.""

Also, what happens when the people that have something to hide are our judges, representatives, Senators, and President? Would they be willing to stand up against those holding their secrets against them? Would they do what's right at the expense of having an affair revealed, being bought off revealed, etc.? 

A spy system of this magnitude is not something that produces the healthy nation I want. I don't think it something produces a healthy nation that we all want.

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the recent revelations around the National Security Agency’s (NSA) telephone and internet surveillance program.  I appreciate hearing from you about this issue.  

 

In June 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed himself as the source of a leak of classified information relating to U.S. government surveillance program.  Disclosed through a series of articles in The Guardian (UK) earlier in the month, Snowden’s information included details on a court order for Verizon users’ phone data. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage, theft and conversion of government property. Since the leak, Snowden has traveled from Hong Kong to Russia. The Administration has urged Russia to transfer Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.

 

On June 12, 2013, General Keith Alexander, chief of both the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee. General Alexander said during the hearing that the U.S. surveillance programs have helped thwart “dozens” of terror attacks, including the cases of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American who pled guilty to a 2009 plot against the NYC subway system and David Headley, the Pakistani-American who facilitated the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India.  

 

Under the Patriot Act, as reauthorized in 2005, user data ""must be 'relevant' to an authorized preliminary or full investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities."" The 2005 Act also established congressional oversight for the FISA program, requiring the DOJ to conduct an audit of the program and the ""effectiveness"" of Section 215, and to submit an unclassified report on the audit to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary and Intelligence.  

 

We need to make every effort to ensure our national security and the safety of the American people.  It is also essential that the executive branch operate with transparency and ensure that our counterterrorism efforts do not infringe on the civil liberties of American citizens. 

 

I have concerns about how the administration has interpreted Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which makes it easier to obtain business records deemed relevant to a national-security investigation.  On June 13, I attended a classified briefing with administration officials to discuss these issues and Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  I look forward to continue examining this issue in the current session of Congress to ensure that we are not sacrificing our fundamental values and ideals in the face of critical threats.

 

Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future about this or any other matter of importance to you.

 

For more information on this or other issues, I encourage you to visit my website, http://casey.senate.gov.  I hope you will find this online office a comprehensive resource to stay up-to-date on my work in Washington, request assistance from my office or share with me your thoughts on the issues that matter most to you and to Pennsylvania.

Multiple Founding Fathers were extremely worried about a Bi-Partisan system emerging, and warned the American people about it.

It has become more apparent today that this will never be the case unless we start voting people in office who have their morals but are not going to be blind to the reality that compromise is the only way to go.

I recognize the time and effort that you are dedicating to actively participate in the democratic process, and I appreciate that you and other concerned citizens have provided me the benefit of your comments on this important matter.  
 
As you know, various laws provide law enforcement and intelligence officials with tools to investigate spies, terrorists, and foreign-based enemies of the United States.  At the same time, the Fourth Amendment to our Constitution guarantees privacy by protecting our homes, persons, and property from unreasonable government searches and seizures.  It is sometimes necessary to balance privacy interests against other important values, such as national security.  Though these questions are often difficult, members of Congress must always respect and obey the Constitution.  
 
Privacy is an essential part of the freedom that makes America great.  It is the duty of members of Congress to uphold the protections of the Constitution while also ensuring the safety and security of Americans.  I have worked with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that relevant laws are constitutional and that government searches are no broader than necessary to protect our nation from the continuing threat of terrorism.
 
On June 14, 2013, I attended the classified briefing provided to Senators by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA Director Keith Alexander, and other Obama Administration officials.  You may be certain that I take seriously the role of Congress in providing oversight of these programs, and that I have been and will continue to closely monitor the intelligence activities of the U.S. government.

131,"Many non-issues in American politics aren't non-issues at all - in fact, they're quite the opposite. We NEED people to speak out in these areas right now.",10.0,1htpw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1htpw9/many_nonissues_in_american_politics_arent/,34.0,1373235240.0,"So every time abortion, gay rights, equality, etc. is brought up, at least a few people shout out about how it's a ""non-issue"" and how we should be focusing on economy, foreign policy, jobs, whatever. 

I don't see it as such. In fact, I think that the fact that so many people brush aside ""non-issues"" as unimportant affairs is actually detrimental to the quality of politics, as well as the perception of our politicians. Hear me out. 

So let's look at the most popular things that people would consider ""non-issues,"" especially those that came up during the 2012 election: gay rights, abortion, sexism, racism, the justice system (i.e. Trayvon Martin, anti-protest violence), student loans, tax dodging, and some may even argue the recent NSA spying. 

What do all of these things have in common? 

*Each of these topics highlights a divide in privilege that affects a large portion of the country - half, if not more.* 

Sexual orientation, race, gender, religion, and class are the primary subjects of recent progressive movements, including Occupy, the feminist surge, and the ever-present gay rights movements. If you yourself are not affected by inequality (read: if you are not an average-intelligence, educated, moderately-wealthy white straight cisgendered man), you probably know someone who is affected by one of these prejudices. And chances are that you know at least one person who is politically active in these fields.  

What does this have to do with the deterioration of politics? 

By shrugging off the legitimate opinions of those who are affected by these issues, we are not only ignoring one of their standpoints - we're blocking them out in the main field of politics. 

If we think a woman is overreacting because she's an abortion activist, or a gay politician is only good for his gay rights activism, what do we think of their views on economics, jobs, drugs, immigration? Or better yet, what do those who have influence in their fields have to say about them? Most Congressmen are rich, old white men who endorse other white men, and are paid and endorsed by corporations to hold their standpoint. 

Very few are outspoken about these issues that concern the public directly. However, these few are constantly followed by their own supporters, creating a better representative for their people. Elizabeth Warren, for example, seems to be the new queen of /r/politics. Not for nothing, either - in Massachusetts, she was a hit with liberals, who were glad to see someone step up so boldly. They came for the basic liberal values and stayed for the outcry against big banks. 

The ongoing prejudice in media and government against those who speak out against these issues means that we'll have less and less awareness with the majority of the nation - who are, unfortunately, less active voters. 

Speaking of the majority of the nation - let's be realistic, how many people here are actually equal under the law in America today? Half of the human population is female, anywhere between 10-20% of people are gay, over a third of the country is ""lower middle class"" or poorer, a third is Black/Asian/Hispanic/etc., 20% has a disability with half of those being extremely debilitating... 

In other words, much more than half of our country - an overwhelming majority, really - probably has some sort of institutional/societal bias against them. It can be as small as prejudice in the streets, to an obvious job bias that you can't prove on paper, to the amount you make versus someone else of the same job, to being investigated on a city street just for looking suspicious. 

You can't focus on elephants stomping around in the room when a guy's coming after you with a knife. In other words, a lot of people would rather fight for direct change than focus on things beyond their reach. Cutting stem cell research funding? Well, what about the school funding that just got cut? Giving secret assistance to extremist groups? What about the fact that my own country won't let me marry? And forget NSA spying, when I can't walk down the street without a cop pulling me aside and patting me down. (Note: these do not necessarily apply to the author) Many people have no time nor energy nor accessibility anymore to be so politically knowledgeable as those who view these as ""non-issues"" seem to. 

With that said, as we widen our demographic spectrum, we also widen our government's viewpoints. As it stands, like I said, Congress has a majority of people of one specific background - rich, old, white men. Not that all of Congress is, but it's a significant number. Most were brought up with similar viewpoints, most likely. However, as we broaden the number of people with different views from the norm, we can also bring new viewpoints to so-called ""larger issues."" People with different experiences obviously bring different opinions to the table. To promote such an agenda would create a much healthier government.  

At the end of it all, the lack of caring by the privileged and political towards those below them may be beneficial to themselves. Corporations are growing, Congress's salary is growing, and at the same time, we, the everyday citizens, by the power of their oppression, lack our own power to have a say in much of anything. If we can't have a voice in how we are treated by our own government and society, will we ever have a voice of power for the things that concern the longevity of other fields of our country? 

To ignore these non-issues - which, by the way, are often combated against by liberals - means to ignore the basic welfare of our people. You don't have to agree with them, although that would be nice; it's just not in the best nature to shrug these things off as unimportant. It's a disgusting display of (dare I say it?) ignorant privilege to do so. 

**We cannot focus on the politics of the country as a whole unless the whole of our country is looked after.** 

Again, this is not that there aren't other issues that should be looked at. What I'm saying is that, unfortunately, our country is in such a state of turmoil that we can't just push aside the aforementioned types of issues that are so often discussed in politics.

But what sorts of impact can a vote have? We mostly think of it in terms of deciding who wins, but that's not the only possible impact. One of the main motivations of politicians and their parties are to win and keep winning. If they notice voters moving to one particular side on one or more issues, it could lead them to change their stance or priorities over time to try to win those voters. For instance, if a whole lot of people started voting 3rd party because opposition to something generally supported by both major parties (i.e. NSA-type stuff), that would likely cause some politicians in the major parties to drift in that direction. They would see it as a way to gain votes against their opponent in the other major party, *even if they don't think the third party could ever win*.

And for many parts of the country, where one party is almost always guaranteed to win, it seems that your vote is more likely to have this type of effect rather than change the outcome of the particular election you are voting in. In these cases, does it make more sense to vote based on how we think that may change the major party(ies) when they want to win your vote back, moreso than to simply ask ""who do I want to win"" and vote for that person?

As a more concrete example, I consider myself a ""free-market Democrat"". In the next presidential election I will probably prefer the Democrat to win. However, I feel like if a larger number of people voted libertarian, the Republicans and Democrats would be most likely to react in one of these ways to chase those voters: both may chill a bit on drugs and terrorism, Democrats may be more market-oriented, Republicans may be less anti-immigrant. I see those as being good ways for the 2 major parties to change. Does this mean it would make more sense for me to vote libertarian even though I won't want the libertarian to win?

In an article on Electronic Frontier Foundation ([source](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/fisa-court-has-been-radically-reinterpreting-privacy-law-secret)), the court has seemed to completely outstepped its original intent, as the article points out:

> The court, which was originally set up to just approve or deny wiretap requests now “has taken on a much more expansive role by regularly assessing broad constitutional questions and establishing important judicial precedents,” with no opposing counsel to offer counter arguments to the government, and rulings that cannot be appealed outside its secret structure.

The New York Times quite astutely stated that the FISA court ""has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court."" Now, my issue is what legal authority do these FISA courts derive their authority from? They make broad constitutional decisions, particularly regarding warrants and seizure under the 4th Amendment, without any proper constitutional authority delegated to the court. What is worse in my opinion is that it seems the court cannot be tried or appealed whatsoever, since it is a creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), enacted by Congress, though not with these intentions.

What do any of you think of the FISA courts which oversee the NSA surveillance programs? What authority are they derived from and what actions are legally available to begin to dismantle such gross over accumulations of power that seem to bypass checks and balances?",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

How does this change things?",8.0,19rhtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/19rhtc/lets_say_hypothetically_the_nsa_is_spying_on/,19.0,1362552973.0,"Before we launch into the political discussion about antiquated things like the fourth amendment of the constitution or the foreign intelligence act, let's have a quick discussion about the technical capabilities of the agency.

You probably don't know much about the NSA. Good, we'd like to keep it that way. The budget itself is classified. The question is, what does this classified budget buy you? Quite a lot. Let's look at publicly available information.

The Narus STA 6400 is a fast machine. As fast as the speed of light, give or take. Klein told us that these were installed in the infamous [Room 641A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A) in the SBC Communications building at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco. If his.. allegations are true, this would provide the capability to duplicate in real time, all traffic without slowing anything down. A win-win scenario. The question is where that information goes, and what's done with it. 

This brings us to [Utah](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1). $3+ billion and counting will buy you a very nice state of the art supercomputer facility these days. Except this one is focused on storage. Storing what exactly? Well, I'd love to say random numbers but you all aren't going to believe that, now are you? Those familiar with computer engineering will probably be able to work out on a napkin how many conventional hard disks you can buy for a billion dollars, and what kind of storage capacity that would provide. Has anyone even used the word Yottabyte in daily conversation?

Okay, so what goes in there? Nobody knows. Let's talk about what *could fit in there*. All the cloned internet traffic is no problem. We don't need to re-download every porn video, all that's really interesting is the URL. 1 copy is sufficient. Encrypted data, of course, given priority since it surely must be interesting material and can always be put on the top of the heap for the petaflop supercomputers to gnaw through. If we can't crack it now, at least archive it for later. 

So basically, e-mails, text messages, URLs, things of this sort are child's play. Unique images and videos, while slightly larger in the scale of things are barely a dent. Padded encryption and steganography is always tricky to deal with, but pattern recognition can often pull out the answers.

Finally the question that's always raised ""how are you going to analyze all this"", which is funny to me because being involved in downsizing myself there's one thing that applies to all industries: computers can replace humans. 30 years ago when an intelligence analyst had to sort through photocopied papers, it was a real hard job. Now, with computers like the Titan or Sequoia the problem of intelligence analysis can just become another massively parallel process. The task can be broken up just like any other.

Information is fed in, categorized and sorted (voice to text is no problem anymore, by the way). It's not technically a ""search"" until someone accesses those files.. of course they'd have to have a reason to get a warrant. So overall, let's just hypothetically assume that the NSA could analyze and process, in real time every phone call, skype call, text message, video stream, e-mail, reddit post...

How would this affect your behaviour? Would you think twice about what to search for on Google? Might you change your taste in adult videos? Do you see yourself talking to your friends in some sort of coded rhymes when writing e-mails? How badly do you want to visit Al-Jazeera?

Surveillance happens in public places. When I go to public places, I gotta expect to be seen by strangers anyways. It doesn't matter whether they see me face to face or through a camera.
If there's a camera in more private places such as restrooms I don't care either as long as it's for security reasons. And in case it's abused...What can happen? Some creep jerking off to a video of me taking a shit? If he thinks he should publish it on the internet, the law will be on my side.
Oh right, the internet. Well, it's pretty much the same. I don't mind if the government knows what I'm doing on the internet.

Well, they will know everything about my secret fetish or what kinds of food I like to buy...but does it affect me in any negative way? I don't think so.
It's the same with speed cameras. People think they are being ripped off by the state because of perfidious placement...Well, the truth is that nothing will happen as long as one doesn't exceed the speed limits.

So, all in all I think one should regard the problem in a teleogical way. Rather billions of ""exposed"" people than one more rape incident in public areas.

To be honest, I didn't read all of the comments carefully. However, I realized that I made a mistake. I think there's a **huge** difference between public surveillance (through cameras), speed cams and the ""secret"" monitoring of internet activities that is done by the NSA etc.

So, I think I'm gonna revise my opinion:

* After reading your arguments, I still think that surveillance cameras are nothing to worry about. As I said, the worst thing that can happen is that some creep is jerking off to some public restroom recordings. Meh. But if it increases the chance of a rape incident getting solved (even if just by a few percents) it is totally worth the 'risk'

* I gotta admit that I've been naive about the monitoring of internet activity. I revise my opinion on this, since it is indeed a fact that 

>the government is full of paranoids that see everyone as a threat
>and the chance of abuse is too high to feel safe.
([u/newpolitics](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/22b9b5/i_dont_really_mind_surveillance_speed_cams_or_the/cgl4kpj))

* Concerning speed cameras:

>Also speed cameras suck terribly, where I live there was a faulty one that was issuing people tickets for months before the cops fixed it. Guess what? Most people paid the fine anyway to avoid the court costs. 
([u/newpolitics](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/22b9b5/i_dont_really_mind_surveillance_speed_cams_or_the/cgl4kpj))

We often have faulty speed cameras in Austria too. It happened a few times. But each time, everyone got their fine (and eventual court costs) fully refunded. 


>Think about the concept of a speed camera. Its only purpose is to ticket people well after the fact, and the danger is passed. A cop on the beat could actually pull them over, write them a ticket, and they will no doubt be driving slower on the way home.

We have mobile speed cameras in Austria and Germany. And there are certain routes where people know that somewhere will be a speed camera. But you can never predict it, because they constantly change the position. Nowadays, almost everyone follows the speed limits on this particular route.


>The ""gotcha"" method of speed traps, red light cameras, etc. does not. It doesn't stop speeding and bad driving. It simply punishes after the fact.

However we now know that the NSA also archives much more than just the ""metadata"" (whatever that means anymore) of your personal communications. With this fact in mind, do you feel that there is a fundamental right to online communications which are not archived by the NSA (meaning it isn't sifted in any way by the NSA and remains completely private. Much like an old fashioned letter would be.) Or do you believe that the threat of terrorism is so strong that any online communcation should be subject to NSA oversight in order to make sure another 911 doesn't happen. 

The closure of lavabit concretes the idea that any service which is truly private will either be subject to turn over their data over to the Feds, or face closure. In the case of Lavabit he chose to close his company instead of complying, and now he faces a federal trial. So, to reiterate the question, should services like Lavabit be able to have a service which ensures private communications, or are we in a new age where any online communication should be at the very least sifted through by an NSA algorithm.

If you really think it is reasonable to consider the struggle against terrorism as a ""war"", do you think this war will ever end?

My own opinion is that for anything to be considered as a ""war"", there must be a possibility of the war ending at some point. Otherwise, it should not be called a war. Having a permanent war would mean that all laws, rules etc made for peacetime would become meaningless, which is in my opinion unacceptable.

While not an expert by any means, he is in law school and knows a bit about the constitution. He directed me to an interesting essay [about the national security exceptions for the 4th amendment](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226404). In the essay I found some interesting reasoning. 

 >In early 1954, Hoover wrote Brownell ostensibly for the Attorney General’s guidance on Irvine v. California, in which the Supreme Court had squarely held that the warrantless installation of a microphone inside a suspect’s house violated the Fourth Amendment.126
In May 1954, Brownell responded by memorandum. Recognizing that “in some instances the use of microphone surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons,” Brownell believed that “the national interest requires that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”127	Though warning that microphone surveillance involving “a trespass... must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances of each case

A very early form of warrentless wiretapping.

>The key to the legal theory in Brownell’s memorandum was a distinction between “evidence collection” and “intelligence gathering.""...  The Brownell memorandum, therefore, permitted trespassory bugging, so long as it remained for “purely intelligence” matters.

Personally, I see abuse that can easily arise from this reasoning, but I digress.

>Brownell’s memorandum served as precedent for succeeding administrations to authorize warrantless trespassory bugging in national security matters, and subsequent Attorneys General expressly authorized warrantless security searches if the Bureau limited their use to “intelligence” or non-evidentiary purposes.

And here we have a precedent to be followed.

>According to Justice Department memoranda, however, [William] Rogers restricted his authorization to searches “for purposes of intelligence and not for the purpose of prosecution.”

William Rogers was the successor to Brownell.

>By the 1960s, both agents and lawyers felt comfortable with the principle of the national security exception to the Fourth Amendment but acknowledged the exception’s limited nature, referring to security investigations as “intelligence” (rather than “evidentiary”) searches.

Again, the potential for abuse here is growing.

>The pure intelligence rule, in other words, was intended to regulate warrantless electronic surveillance and physical searches, and the practice helped avoid being under the thumb of judicial review.


So even before the Patriot Act, warrentless wiretapping was legal as long as it followed the pure intelligence rule.

>More recently, warrantless surveillance has become part of major counterterrorism operations. The Terrorist Surveillance Program, for example, allegedly collected thousands of transnational calls without judicial approval.

Treading rough waters

>And while FISA initially authorized only surveillance pursuant to a warrant, Congress recently amended the statute to permit certain warrantless surveillance. Today that authorization is found in Section 702 of FISA, added through the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA).

Really Congress?

>Like earlier operations, today’s warrantless surveillance can occur without agents first establishing probable cause. Section 702 of FISA, for example, eliminates the probable cause showing that Titles I and III of FISA require.271	Instead, the section only requires a “reasonabl[e] belie[f]” that the target is a non-U.S. person located outside the United States and thatthe collection has foreign intelligence purpose.

>Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, a case challenging the constitutionality of Section 702 surveillance on Fourth Amendment grounds, has recently been heard in the Supreme Court (on standing grounds).

There are dozens of cases like this that challenge the constitutionality of FISA and its rules.

Where's the outcry to change this policy? Wheres the petition to get rid of congressmen who support this interpretation of the 4th amendment?

The attacks on the World Trade Center marked the beginning of what has effectively become World War III.  Eleven years later, in 2012, at what posterity might consider the height of WWIII, the first World President was elected.

I've been on this planet nearly forty years and I don't ever remember anyone in Europe ever giving a rat's ass about who was elected President of the United States.  In 2012 they couldn't get enough of it.  Had there actually been a democratic election for President of the World, I have no doubt that Barack Obama would have been the choice.

The entire world is in a state of war fatigue.  In 2012 we saw a light at the end of the tunnel.  The tunnel has since collapsed.  The shadow war against Al Qaeda or militant Islam or whatever you want to call it is as hot as ever...and no longer confined to Iraq and Afghanistan.  Perhaps that was the original plan, to keep the conflict confined to a particular area or two, but if so, the train has come off the rails.

Add to the aforementioned conflict the chaos across the Arab world.  Egypt has undergone yet another military coup.  The civil war in Syria is two years old.  Qaddafi dead.  Attacks in Mali.  Fighting in Somalia.  Destruction in Nigeria.  Israel and Palestine are *still* killing each other.  Several European nations still have troops fighting, and I'm pretty sure the French Foreign Legion has been getting a workout.  There are literally *dozens* of countries whose soldiers are firing bullets at somebody right now.  Regular people are tired of this shit and I think that's what the citizens of the world were looking for in 2012, a beginning to the end of this mess the world is in right now.

But that's not what we got.  Instead of two big-ish wars we now have shedloads of little wars that everybody is involved in.  Keep in mind, when I say 'we' I mean everybody.  Humans.  All of us.  Everyone is tired of the fighting, of the bad news, every day.  Tired of the economy being in the dumps, tired of the absence of greatness.  On November 6, 2012, the entire world was watching for Filet Mignon.  What we got was chicken salad.

Barack Obama had the ear of the world on November 6, 2012.  On November 7th, he let it go.  The machine has been running itself, almost as if it's on autopilot the last few years.  The bureaucracies are now run with the purpose of perpetuating themselves.  No one is taking the lead to stop the madness.

If the statistics about U.S. Intelligence employees are true, i.e. 850,000 people are employed in such trade, what honestly can be done about anything Intelligence does?  *Eight hundred fifty thousand.*  To even put a dent in that number you'd have to fire General Electric.  Such a large mass cannot be led, cannot be controlled, cannot be managed.  The only real way to solve the problems of secret courts and wiretapping the world is to gut it.

But if we gut it, with the economy in the state that it is now, would, again, be like firing General Electric.  Even I can see that such a decision is unacceptable for the President of the United States.  These people are paid a very great deal of money and there are a great many of them.  It's almost a stimulus program of its own, pouring tens of billions of dollars into the hands of American citizens (and I'm sure citizens of many other countries too) every year.

This system that we've built for ourselves is driving itself.  It's not good, or evil or motivated by anything, it just exists.  It cannot be steered, if even vaguely directed.  It will continue to grow, to impose itself and to interfere with the lives and politics of all people.  Would a rational person bug European trade officials before a big trade agreement?  This isn't something that the President probably even knew about.  This isn't something that a President does.  It's like we got cheating at poker.  Not cool.

This is something that a flunkie in State who has drinks with some buddies at the NSA and they concocted some scheme to do stuff.  I can't even begin to imagine what the motive might be besides it giving people jobs for several months until they go onto the next project.  These supposed 850,000 people have to spend their time doing something, or why have them employed at all?  Having been a consultant myself, I know very well that end of a contract is not a good thing.  One can get very creative when it comes time to get a new contract.

While President Obama has been elected President of the United States, he is not presidential.  He has not stood up to the cronies who now issue orders to the FBI and even the security services of other countries.  Don't think the Motion Picture Association of America didn't have something to do with New Zealand SWAT raiding the home of a giggling fat man.  How exactly is it that we can just about force the law enforcement arms of other countries to act on our whim?  Detain the President of Bolivia?  No problem!

Somebody needs to step up to the plate and tell the children that playtime is over.  We have Big Brother watching our every move, we've got banks robbing their clients and citizenry blind, we've got police departments buying tanks and machine guns.  They don't do this because they're evil or wicked.  They do this because this is what these organizations do.  It's their job.  The spies are *supposed* to spy, the bankers are *supposed* to maximize profits.  The police are *supposed* to fight crime.  Why on Earth *wouldn't* they want all the tools available to them at their disposal?  Somebody needs to be there to tell them ""no"".

That somebody is you.  Get on the phone.  Call your elected officials.  Go to their offices.  Tell them, ""No.""

171,Failure From the Top Down; the Snowden Chronicles,7.0,1g2fsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1g2fsj/failure_from_the_top_down_the_snowden_chronicles/,4.0,1370895216.0,"The recently revealed data gathering on the part of the US government is the culmination of failures at nearly every level of our society, save the individual, which finds its expression in Edward Snowden.

According to Rep. Peter King, he is “dangerous to the country”, but in reality this guy isn't the problem, or a danger for that matter. If nothing, this man is a patriot. While I am not defending his actions outright; I have too little information to do that, his exposure to this program is certainly now at an end, and all the “danger” he poses now is as a spokesperson or a martyr. Care should be exercised, regardless of his level of deviation from the law, that he remain (and be encouraged to be) the former rather than become the latter. His actions, illegal though they are, fall well within the lines of civil disobedience exercised with reason and prudent consideration of the consequences not for himself, but for the nation. Knowledge that this program exists simply does not need to be Top Secret. Do you really think that anyone trying to hide their associations isn't cloning telephones and routing data through false IPs?

If Mr. Snowden wished to be a danger, he would have disclosed details of the program, not the program's existence itself.

From the top down, the US Government has failed its citizenry in the FBI's request to the FISC on behalf of the NSA. Whether or not you support the Patriot Act, it has been both passed and renewed by our elected representatives. The care with which it should be applied has evidently not been monitored, and so we have an indication, as many privacy advocated have accused, that the law is more porous than it ought to be if a court would permit an interpretation as egregious as this.

Not realizing that a patriotic citizen might perform this act of civil disobedience underpins the truly horrific nature of this order and the system that begot it. Truly, the litmus test for whether a government should ever exercise its authority in a covert manner is whether a breach of this sort might transpire through the acts of one of its loyal citizens.

Failure!

That our elected representatives on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including the slightly more noble Sens. Wyden and Udall, were unwilling to be whistle blowers themselves illustrates a moral failing in our elected representatives. Certainly, if a US Senator feels the need to “hint” at something he shouldn't be hinting at, then he should know that he ought not be circumspect. As a citizen patriot sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution, he should know that the Patriot Act is just an Act, and that the overriding precept of the Constitution is that it “outranks” mere laws, even the important ones. What's more, I hardly expect a rogue Senator to carry the same level of risk at disclosure than Mr. Snowden.

When it comes down to it, had a sitting Senator blown a whistle, I find it hard to believe that he would end up in the stockades. Rather, the debate would be elevated and the political will of the people would surely have defended him in a way that I'm not quite sure it will for Mr. Snowden. Our politicians are risk-averse when it comes to advocating for the citizenry, as a result of our politics and the introverted nature of the political world, and it has left our Constitution woefully undefended.

Failure!

That Mr. Snowden was not a US Government employee, but instead worked for the private consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton, signals yet another layer of failure. The outsourcing of work so deeply entrenched in our national security interests that it causes such an uproar upon its disclosure is simply unacceptable by any reasonable definition of discretion. Outsourcing to private companies, let alone one held by a globally interested Private Equity [Carlyle] firm, many of whose interests are capitally rather than patriotically oriented, is the pinnacle of poor decision making in an intelligence  field where controlling information is the bellwether by which performance can be measured.

Failure!

The screening process that permitted Mr. Snowden, a presumably honorably discharged, yet, in the formal sense, woefully uneducated individual, to access this information, must also be called into question. Clearance is administered by the Federal Government, and this process must either be considered wholly effective, in which case this breach signals Mr. Snowden's patriotism, or defective because it permitted someone who clearly embraces a worldview that values freedom over government to pursue this course of action.

Failure!

No executive at Verizon, and certainly not the team of executives, stood up and refused this order. To any reasonable person of merit, this order signals something deeply wrong with the execution of the law by which it derives its interpretation. At worst, it constitutes literally hundreds of millions of unconstitutional searches.

Think about it this way: would the FBI been able to obtain any warrants to search a citizen's house for their phone bill to obtain this same information without cause? Scale matters here, and the fact that more than one entity (Verizon and the customer) has access to this data does not mean that obtaining a warrant pell-mell for the information is any more constitutional than the IRS receiving daily updates of every individual's bank accounts in order to detect tax fraud. The IRS does get reports on the big transactions, but it is the banks that provide it, as it should be here with Verizon*.

Verizon's executives had neither the interests nor the courage to propel them to simply not comply. Complicity is the enemy of reason, and the number of scenarios by which this order could have been alluded to publicly. No disclosure of the order need have been made, simply a lack of compliance and let the chips fall where they may. After all, is the government going to sue Verizon out of business, stranding the American people who are its shareholders to destitution for that part of their portfolios?

Failure!

Mr. Snowden, finally, didn't tell his family, as far as we know, that he was about to do what he's done. Presumably, that was not to worry them. I can't help but think, though, that his mother's response would have been eerily close to that of my own mother's. That he should come to his senses, keep his head down, not ruin his life, and that others know better than he. In point of fact, families love each other and when a member is exposed to the threat of reprisal, this response is normal and healthy.

At the same time, this response that I have assigned the poor Mrs. Snowden (apologies, my dear), and the act of protection (for even a day) that her son most likely performed, indicates that our families are failing. There was a time, generations distant for the most part, where nearly every mother, despite her love and fears, proudly sent her sons off to war to defend our Great Nation. That Mr. Snowden presumably could not count on that same encouragement, from family, friends, and community to quite literally risk his life in the service of his nation, is a sad thing. On this last point, only, do I hope I'm gravely mistaken.

*In a marginally related sidenote: Why was there no protocol set up to query specific data from this database while creating a simple, one to one encrypted hash for personal information and GPS data? The NSA and CIA have exceptionally gifted cryptographers and statisticians who certainly have the ability to cull meaningful information from anonymous data with the same rigor, sophistication, and alacrity whether or not they can see specific data. A hash could have been created, sent to Verizon, and the data transmitted back could have been fully analyzed and queried through the hash to Verizon's database to deliver real-time, meaningful information. If I can think of it, they surely can, and if the judge ruling on this order could not, or did not consider this as a better alternative, then the failure gains yet another layer.",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

We take for granted that polarization is bad and that finding areas where we can agree and compromise is good. 


I'm starting to wonder if that actually is the case. I am getting the sense that within the progressive movement, their end goals- things like 'free' college, healthcare, basic income, etc. are far more important than any sort of compromise or agreement that would bring anything less than what they are after. I get this sentiment from liberals and progressives I see in the media, real life, and the campaigns of both Sanders and Clinton. And it makes sense too- why would you compromise on something like free community college when your real goal is to eventually make all higher education free? If you can do it, wouldn't it be better to have a highly polarized society full of shaming and beating down your opposition to get something done than to compromise?


So maybe this idea of 'political unity' is not so appealing after all. Many Republicans seem to be trying to campaign on this, assuming that this is what people want. Carson's book is called ""One Nation"", Jeb and Rubio talk about wanting to bring people together, and Rand Paul is probably doing the most of anyone to this end. He's campaigning for criminal justice reform in the war on drugs and nsa/patriot act wiretapping reform, areas Republicans generally never go near and has had great bipartisan success in the senate. He's going to berkely to talk about privacy rights, ferguson and detroit to try and reach out to minority voters, coming up with new ideas like restoring non-violent felons the right to vote. These are all places where democrats and progressives could agree and find common ground. Yet I just saw Paul go on the Daily Show and instead of talking about things like this, Stewart spent the majority of the interview grilling him on his position about whether or not christian businesses should have to bake gay wedding cakes. I understand that this is a very important issue to progressives, and you may really dislike some of the positions Paul might hold on it.


But my question is, is it more important to achieve progressive ideals by hook or by crook, or is there value in compromise and finding common ground in places where democrats and republicans can come together? I used to think the answer was obviously the latter, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe what the Obama years have taught us is that political unity is not actually so appealing after all, if your goal is to get things you want done. That could be a valid opinion, though I admit I disagree.


What do you think? Do you understand what I'm trying to say here? Would you frame it any differently? Will any of you openly say that you are more interested in achieving your end goals than working out compromises that may not get you everything you want? I don't think there's any shame in taking that position, I just disagree. Anyway, sorry for the huge post- let's discuss.",PoliticalDiscussion,NSA

An American who is more patriot than ""citizen of the world"" must oppose the revelation of classified information because American power in the world is reliant on secrecy. We are less valuable to allies and less fearsome to enemies if our military and intelligence capabilities are known.

Every President or Prime Minister would like the people of his country to be patriotic and the people everywhere else not to be. If we all loved America as much as Donald Trump claimed to, we'd sure be rich. Gates and Buffett would give their money to kids in Chicago and Appalachia instead of Africa and the Middle East. Thankfully, for the children half a world away who suffer from AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Bill Gates is not a patriot. A patriotic man thinks the suffering of foreigners is less important than the suffering of his countrymen. An enlightened man does not. A good man does not.

Last week, in a comfortable room in Moscow, Edward Snowden, the most infamous leaker of U.S. secrets of all time, told NBC anchor Brian Williams that he thought of himself as a patriot. If the motivation for his actions was patriotism, he must have been profoundly naive about U.S. politics. Otherwise he would have realized that the Supreme Court in 1972 and the Church Committee in 1975 and President Ford in 1976--all 3 branches of government in 4 years--tried to rein in the overreach of intelligence gathering and failed. The breadth of U.S. surveillance has only grown. The U.S. Senators and Presidents who promise transparency and easing of our intelligence operations are the same ones who were briefed on the contents of Bin Laden's computer.

Maybe Snowden was aware of the inefficacy of the previous attempts to restrict U.S. intelligence gathering, but in his patriotic fervor believed that the suite of documents he could bring to the American public would be enough to finally exhort change and strengthen the nation. But that sounds awfully foolish for a man shrewd enough to be branded a traitor and still capture American hearts.

All the evidence suggests that Snowden knew that his revelations would weaken the United States, at least in the short term and medium term. His leaked documents eroded the trust our allies had in us and gave our enemies reason to rally against us.

Who is Edward Snowden, then? Traitor? hero? His crime was telling 6 billion people the ways in which the most powerful intelligence community in the most powerful country in the world, which happened to be his own, was spying on all the citizens of the world.

People less aligned with Obama accuse him of being weak and incompetent, others blame the unprecedented push-back and resistance from Congress. Both claims are in part the answer. The true answer is that Obama has lame-ducked himself, by failing to manage his political capital properly. 

But this to me begs a bigger question: what is political capital? How does it function? How does one save and spend this elusive and all-powerful commodity? 

**Presidential Politics and Political Capital**

On the surface, one would argue the American President is one of the most powerful political figures in existence, if not in history. He commands the most powerful military in the world, through his veto power, he has incredible legislative sway, and his control over federal agencies grants increasingly massive regulatory power, not to mention the ability to name thousands of appointments, big and small, executive, and judicial. But the most powerful political asset, has been and always will be, his ability to command attention. 

The President can take control over the airwaves with hours notice, he has a press corp that has office space in the West Wing as well as travels with him. Anything he says is mentioned in the press, if not front line news/world news. The President can potentially put any issue on the table when he chooses or raise anyone's profile overnight. 

But there is a string attached to all this. It's called, you can't please everyone. And with the President, this catch can be excruciating, because of the massive profile of the position. There is nothing you do, that won't rub someone the wrong way. Every action you take, can please some people, and enrage others. Especially on your own side. 

**How Political Capital Works: Charisma of Different Kinds is the Catalyst**

The biggest challenge a President faces, is getting elected. Getting elected today requires a broad base of support, from both within your own party, and the electorate at large. Primary politics are all about building political capital. You have to convince your own side of four fundamental things before you can count on their financial and political support:

1. That you share their views and values (build rapport).

2. That you're a viable, strong candidate who will deliver gains (promise/deliver ""results"").

3. That you have a backbone and don't follow the herd (take a stand).

4. That you can and will *draw attention*, and therefore bring attention to their people and issues. 

These are the four fundamental levers of political capital. I can summarize them essentially as: Warmth, Authority, Vision, and Presence. 

When you think Warmth, think Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.

When you think Authority, think George W. Bush or Margaret Thatcher.

For Vision, JFK and FDR are good examples. 

And for Presence, the best example I can think of is Josiah Bartlet, from the *The West Wing*. [Skip to 3:15-ish for a good example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8unqrdurxyg)

The thing to notice from this, is what I am really describing is different forms of charisma (read *The Charisma Myth*!). All are important and ideal, but politicians specialize at different kinds. Some are better suited for campaigning, some for governing. I can separate them like this: governing politics are retail politics, campaigning politics are big-stage politics, or... micro and macro politics.

Micro politics is all about working a room - Warmth and Authority. It's building relationships and personal magnetism. That's what lines up support to get legislation passed, volunteers recruited and organized, and traditional fundraising. The ground game of politics. Doesn't lead to big plays, but little by little, decides the game, especially in the clutch moments. 

Macropolitics, utilizing Vision and Presence is the air game. Micropolitics gets people to support you, Macropolitics is what creates cults of personality and movements. Without good micropolitics, you can't build coalitions and power bases, without good macropolitics you can't turn the corner into a movement. 

Someone with good macro game but weak micro is the stereotypical politician who's support is ""a mile wide and an inch deep"". This is why small states are the early states in the primaries. It tests a candidate's ability to start a ground game, and establish the run so to speak. A politician with weak retail politics is a very vulnerable candidate.   

**Obama and Political Capital**

I argue the following: Obama won the primaries because Hillary Clinton excelled in Authority, but was weak in Presence, Vision, and Warmth. Obama utilized his political air game (Presence and Vision) to turn the primaries into a shootout that Hillary couldn't keep up in. 

Then Obama did something politically miraculous. He used the air to successfully establish the run, leveraging his developing cult of personality into a motivated ground game, both from the grassroots and the establishment, who were desperate to see the Republicans out. 

He then won the general because McCain picked a VP candidate who could match Obama for Presence, and then allowed her to be undercut on Authority. Which in turn led to his Authority being undercut by association. His refusal to aggressively attack Obama also undercut any Vision points he could have scored. No wonder 2008 was a rout.

Now we get to Obama's first term, and his weaknesses with micro politics begin to manifest themselves. Obama's weakest suit is Warmth. Bill Clinton survived his later 6 years in office because he was able to utilize his Warmth and political savvy to cut viable compromises with Congressional Republicans (triangulation). Clinton fell back on his ground game, to preserve his air game, and it worked. 

Obama based much of his Authority off being ""above the fray"" and removed from traditional political shenanigans, and in accordance with that, handed control over his legislative centerpiece to Pelosi and Reid, two of the most loathed Democrats, among Republicans. This was a mistake as it undercut his own political Authority, while Obamacare, remained Obamacare. 

Now he had to deal with angry Republicans. Why? Because the congressional Democrats needed Republican cover to survive the midterms, especially with an increasingly agitated Republican base, and Obama, with his systemic weakness of Warmth, and new found weakness in Authority, had nothing to offer. Presence and Vision only work with people who can be swayed, and fall flat in the face of entrenched resistance, where Warmth and Authority provide better results. 

The different forms of charisma (and the political capital that flows from them) feed off of and mutually support each other. The McCain campaign's inability to protect Sarah Palin from the media assault, not only neutralized what she brought to the air game, but also bled McCain's inherent strengths as well. 

Obama won the Presidency because he successfully used his Presence and Vision to create an air of Authority. He lost his political capital because his inability to move the chains on the Hill undercut his Authority. 

Now, someone of a Democrat persuasion would blame this on Republican intransigence and they'd be right. I say, don't stop there, why were the Republicans so intransigent? Why did Bill Clinton succeed where Obama failed? 

Obama has achieved his best results when public opinion was firmly against the Republicans and he could successfully use that stick to bring them to the table. By but refusing to grant the Republicans any ""results"" they wanted, or even convince them that he saw their point of view, he made his Authority dependent upon public opinion. When the wind was blowing his way, he was strong, when it stopped, he was weak. Nothing undercuts Vision faster than this.

So Obama turns to his strong suit which his is incredible Presence. No American president in recent history has had as much sway with the media as Obama has enjoyed, when he encountered resistance, his go-to move was to draw attention to an issue and attempt to shame opponents into cooperation. This has worked a couple of times, but each time it didn't, it brought the bane of Presence closer: over-exposure.

He was able to beat Romney because Romney was a weak candidate. Strong in Authority and Vision, but weak in Presence and Warmth. The Obama campaign's strategy was to neutralize Romney by painting him as bland and unsympathetic. It worked. The only time this strategy was in danger was when Romney trounced Obama in the first debate with the successful use of Authority. However, Romney's lack of Warmth and Presence not only doomed him with independents, it also turned his base off, even though they were just as desperate for a win as Democrats were in 2008.

But now we come to the present. Obama still owns the bully pulpit and has his strength on Presence, but every bit of over-exposure, every strong speech, with a lack of action in its wake, undermines it. His Authority has been completely compromised by the animus Republicans now have towards him. But the real danger he faces is having his Vision undermined. The NSA scandal in particular is the closest Obama has come to looking completely hypocritical, and has given Republicans like Rand Paul the opportunity to take a stand, and score Vision points of their own. 

If I was on Obama's team, I would say the biggest issue by far is the West Wing hemorrhaging what's left of Obama's authority. He can't recapture Vision unless he can deliver results. He can't protect Presence without delivering results. He can't compensate for his lack of Bill Clinton-style micropolitical charm without being able to deliver results. I suspect, that if Obama's team has any brains, you'll see big bipartisan pushes on immigration and the NSA, the lynchpin of which will be Republican support. He needs a win, badly.

Quite right 

The REAL purpose of NSA Mass Surveillance is to undermine democracy in America & the West to promote the interests of large crony Corporations 

International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance - privacy is required in order to maintain democratic processes

Privacy is a fundamental human right, and is central to the maintenance of democratic societies. It is essential to human dignity and it reinforces other rights, such as freedom of expression and information, and freedom of association, and is recognised under international human rights law.[1] Activities that restrict the right to privacy, including communications surveillance, can only be justified when they are prescribed by law, they are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and are proportionate to the aim pursued.[2]

Mass Surveillance is highly ineffective as a counter terrorism measure - see Boston.

It is however a highly effective method of :
Collecting data on people that might otherwise be future domestic political dissenters.
Suppressing any critical media articles and potential government whistle blowers.
Controlling senior government officials and politicians.

The information collected is intended to be used for future blackmail or intimidation to suppress any dissent - see Stasi.

Why not do something about it?,7.0,1kgscj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1kgscj/why_cant_we_do_something_to_take_a_step_towards/,62.0,1376623883.0,"We need to start a good old fashioned letter writing campaign. 

We need a clear concise message, asking for a small change. 

We need to write up a simple letter stating what we believe and what we want changed. 

We need to spread the letter on all social media. Everyone sends the letter to their local representative. It can be any country (letters can be adjusted for each country, or even region). We send the letter at the exact same time. 

Millions of us. We demand change. We demand one small step. The first of many.

I don't know what the step is but it should be simple. Maybe some kind of electoral reform. A step towards changing the way candidates are funded and a step towards proportional representation. 

Demand they limit the amount a corporation or single person can donate. Limit the maximum any one candidate can receive so no one person has too much of an advantage. Candidates should have enough money to properly represent themselves, not enough to make it impossible for anyone else to compete.

Demand a spot on the ballot to write in ""none of the above"". Show these guys that we will vote if they present a candidate to cater to our wants. 

Our wants will be simple. A compromise, a way we can all agree would be better then what we have. 

Incorporate aspects of a free market but tax the shit out of those lucky enough to succeed. 

Reform social programs and actually fund them. 

Rebuild the education system from the ground up.

Initiate free child care!! My god, I'd pay so many taxes to have free childcare. I took a year of early childhood education and have 3yo and a 6yo daughters. Kids are sponges! They love to learn if it's presented in a fun, enthusiastic manner. They fucking crave it. They'll ask you why for 30 minutes (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u2ZsoYWwJA). Hell, give working a parents a place they can drop their kids off for 8 hours where they'll be taken care of by passionate teachers. Fed healthy food. Get the chance to interact with other kids. People already pay $20-$40/day for child care. Make everyone pay an extra $5/day in taxes and we could prob fund it. The effects would be immeasurable. 

Can you imgaine the increase in productive citizens if everyone grew up with that? My god. 

The details don't matter. Someone smarter then me can come up with the specifics. We just have to compromise. The letter could be as simple as asking for a spot on the ballot to vote for ""none of the above"". That alone would give us an avenue to show we will vote if they give us a candidate we can believe in. 

I'm sorry guys, but a lot of us knew Obama wasn't any different then anyone else. The dems and repubs are bought and paid for. Some of them mean well but we're not finding any significant change from them. 

What Obama was, and still is, is a symbol of hope for any non white american. It may sound trite but the effect that has on the average minority american is incalculable. If you don't understand how that's a positive thing (and was way better then Romney, for that reason alone), then I'm afraid you don't get it.

If we say what we want someone will step up and provide it. Millions of votes won't be looked down on. At the very least, they'll give us something. They'll throw us a bone.

People talk about needing change. They think the NSA is spying on them and it's time for revolution.

Why not just try something like this. No one person can make a difference but if we can agree on a simple, unifying message, we could actually stand a chance.

After watching the Sunday news shows, I felt the need to address why I think many of the arguments that are being said without any attempt at expressing the other side should be challenged. 

**-The attacks on Edward Snowden are generational attacks by defensive baby boomers who willfully traded away their civil liberties after 9/11 and are now resistant to admit it was a bad idea.** In their efforts to escape blame they are using Edward Snowden as an opportunity to make classic generational arguments that make the Information Generation the real threat to freedom and national security while ignoring the actual issues raised by the leak. The most egregious example of this technique is David Brooks Op-Ed The Solitary Leaker where he bemoans how Snowden, along with practically any Redditor, ""appears to be a product of one of the more unfortunate trends of the age: the atomization of society, the loosening of social bonds, the apparently growing share of young men in their 20s who are living technological existences in the fuzzy land between their childhood institutions and adult family commitments.""

[Brooks goes on to argue](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/opinion/brooks-the-solitary-leaker.html?_r=0) that we are to blame for ""the rising tide of distrust, the corrosive spread of cynicism, the fraying of the social fabric and the rise of people who are so individualistic in their outlook that they have no real understanding of how to knit others together and look after the common good.""


He makes this argument [seemingly unaware of the irony](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/borowitzreport/2013/06/us-seemingly-unaware-of-irony-in-accusing-snowden-of-spying.html), that a government who sets up a massive, invasive surveillance system on its own citizens might in fact be to blame for the rise of distrust.  

As a thirty-year old, Snowden's first election would have been Bush v. Gore, an election that was full of corruption, cynicism, and ultimately was decided by the Supreme Court. Snowden then volunteered for Army to serve in Iraq, a war which it was later revealed was based on a lie. He saw torture, extrajudicial prisons, and warrant-less wiretapping authorized. He then was inspired by a candidate who sold us all on a dream of Hope and Change, promising to bring transparency to Washington and to [""Strengthen the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board with subpoena powers and reporting responsibilities.""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/civil-rights/) Instead Obama has vastly expanded secret government surveillance programs. The Information Generation is not to blame for the rising level of distrust between citizens and their government. 

**-Senators, Congressmen and Government officials have a conflict of interest when it comes to commenting on Edward Snowden's leak.** What you have to understand about these officials being interviewed about PRISM and the other surveillance programs is that they are the ones who set them in motion. They voted for the Patriot Act. They authorized these programs. Of course they think Edward Snowden is a traitor, if he wasn't that would mean that THEY had done something wrong. The officials going on Sunday shows arguing that these programs did nothing wrong are trying to absolve themselves of blame. This is why the only government officials who are speaking out are people like Rep. Justin Amash and Senator Ron Wyden, who have been wanting to end these programs for years. 

**-Government Surveillance has proper oversight.** PRISM does not have proper government oversight. Consider the facts. Edward Snowden, a contractor of three months gained access to the most privileged secret information. That Snowden was able to make this leak at all proves that there was not proper oversight of this program. But there are plenty of other reasons.

**The leaders of national intelligence agencies have a [conflict of interest when it comes to oversight of spying programs.]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden)** There is a massive conflict of interest between Booz Allen Hamilton (the defense contractor company Snowden worked for) and many of the leaders of the U.S. Intelligence community. The companies that are paid huge sums to spy on us are a revolving door for top officials, including the Director of the C.I.A., James Clapper. In short, government officials are rewarding Booz Allen Hamilton huge contracts then going to work there where they reap the benefits of those contracts. The more they can make this leak about Edward Snowden and the less it is about Booz Allen Hamilton, the better for them.

**-If you are a U.S. citizen, the NSA cannot listen to your conversation:** This is literally just semantics. They CAN listen to your conversation, they're just not supposed to without a warrant. [Here is a better analysis of that statement than I could ever write](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5895887). 

**-Congress has oversight of PRISM and other programs:** First off, congress has a [10% approval rating, the lowest ever measured by Gallup](http://www.newsmax.com/politics/congress-gallup-approval/2013/06/13/id/509815). Why exactly are we supposed to be reassured that they have oversight? Secondly, [James Clapper in testimony before Congress under oath in March of this year lied](http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/making-alberto-gonzales-look-good/) and said there was no program collecting data on U.S. citizens. 
Third, numerous members of congress have publicly stated that they have not gotten answers to their questions on this program. 

**-The judiciary branch oversees PRISM:** The FISA Court has never turned down a PRISM request and filed a court opinion that ""determined that the government had violated the spirit of federal surveillance laws and engaged in unconstitutional spying."" [The Department of Justice is trying to keep that opinion secret.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/06/justice-department-electronic-frontier-foundation-fisa-court-opinion) 

**-50 terrorist plots have been foiled thanks to PRISM:** What is great about this claim is that it can't be proven because all of the evidence is secret. However, the one foiled attack that has specifically been mentioned, the 2009 New York City subway bombings by Najibullah Zazi, [have public documents that contradict the claim that PRISM foiled this plot.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/public-documents-contradict-claim-email-spying-foiled-terror)  

**-The Tech Industry is against PRISM because they have a ""Libertarian streak"":** This attack is specifically designed to marginalize and dismiss the opinions of Americans who are most informed to understand what a program such as PRISM is capable of. It is designed in the hope that when non-tech sector citizens hear cries of alarm, they will think of techies as ""the other"". That tech sector values are different than their own and their concerns shouldn't be heeded. 

**-Edward Snowden was motivated by fame, wasn't self-less, etc.:** This is the most ridiculous charge of them all. Best case scenario, Edward Snowden will spend the rest of his life in a foreign country looking over his shoulder for drone attacks and U.S. agents seeking to extradite him. While he is not military, if he is treated at all like Bradley Manning he can expect to spend [years in solitary confinement, naked without sheets or a pillow, limited physical activity, no access to the outside world and pumped full of anti-depressants](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/05/extreme-solitary-confinement-what-did-bradley-manning-experience.html). Or, there is a possibility like Anwar al-Awlaki, he will end up on Obama's kill list and will be executed without trial. In short, the rest of Snowden's life will likely be terrible.

Given how much media coverage there is of the situation, I wanted to make my headline clear just to warn you what my article is about.   The same man being called a traitor by some is being hailed as a hero by others.   Given the wide range of reasoning behind these viewpoints, I want to bring in to focus the case for and against Edward Snowden.

First, let's make the case for Edward Snowden.   He was hired as a contracted worker for the NSA.  Upon starting the job, he discovered that the government was overriding civil liberties and privacy laws in the name of national security.   While the government is trying to make the case that such steps are necessary, and that they have prevented terrorist attacks, the problem in that argument is that the Boston Marathon Bombers used those same online resources that were being monitored, and despite being warned about the two bombers, somehow they never managed to intercept the attack.  So if they weren't tapping into people they had been warned about, who were they tapping into?  This is a major flaw in the ""necessary for national security"" argument they are presenting.   What doesn't help is that this whole ordeal is coming on the heels of uproar about the IRS targeting certain groups, and media phone records being tapped.   Whilst the Obama administration is swearing there isn't a fire, there is a whole lot of smoke that doesn't look too good.   By all intents and purposes, Edward Snowden appears to be a whistleblower, and the only reason it appears otherwise is that the person he is blowing the whistle on is the United States Government.   For the government to charge Edward Snowden with espionage whilst they are spying on their own citizens is, as the old saying goes, the pot calling the kettle black.  

Then there's the case against Edward Snowden.  The government cannot afford to give details of what they were looking for in tapping the phone and computer records of it's own citizens.  As long as it remains unknown, potentially harmful threats to America do not know what to and what not to avoid.  They have had to remain secretive.   It was also revealed in Hong Kong that Edward Snowden went into the job looking for a way to disseminate information about the NSA.   This report would suggest that he WANTED to find information to give out.  If that was indeed his sole purpose, then there is more validity to the notion that he is a spy.  When police search warrants are issued, they have to specify what they are looking for.   If they search a house looking for drugs, they could find prostitution going on, but they cannot arrest someone for prostitution because that wasn't what they went looking for.  Essentially, an employee accepting tax dollars did not follow proper procedures to investigate the NSA.   Further damaging the case as a whistleblower is that Edward Snowden now seems to be releasing information for the purpose of protecting himself from being extradited.  

So, in my opinion, what this boils down to is how we choose to define a whistleblower.    Can a person be a protected whistleblower when they entered a situation looking for something to be wrong?  It does damage the case suggesting that Edward Snowden innocently found this material.  However, that is an unconfirmed news report:  one that may well sway how you view Edward Snowden.

   These words ring extensively through my head as I imagine someone asking Orwell what he thought of our countries current state of affair, in light of all the transgressions becoming publicly visible with the NSA and the White House’s vehement support of its own actions. The visage of public freedom and personal privacy are slowly being eroded under the guise of anti-terrorism efforts and national security. In some respects these two things have all but disappeared. If one steps back and looks with a worrisome eye, it is hard to not think that our generation stands on the cusp of what must have been the beginning of the setting when Orwell so amiably gave us one of his most important works. 1984 allows us to peer into the future and understand what happens when the looming horrors of war and death, caused over conflicting ideologies gives rise to “national security” and one government’s “protection” against violence and radical activism. But I ask you, who decides what activism is radical and where do we draw the line in legal and warranted actions against wrong doers? How do we maintain an adequate freedom and still secure the safety of our borders and its people? If you are content to watch personal liberties fade away and are willfully ignorant to those in power maintaining power then I would guess that the current state of our country doesn’t give you cause for a second glance. 

   Much like our forefathers misgivings in rebelling against the British crown, I am constantly conflicted between supporting my government and supporting the principles my country was founded on. How do we decide, and more importantly when do we decide that our government no longer has our best interests at heart? These two questions ultimately lead one down a road that ends with what actions should be necessary to remedy the original two. Is it moral to call for bloodshed and violence against the powers that be when those same powers are derelict in their duties? As a humanist I am repulsed by violence but at the same time I know that there are those sitting in our capitol who would not think twice at wiping persons, who threaten their seat of power, from the face of the Earth and would do whatever they could to maintain their status quo. There are groups and gatherings of people who share ideologies like freedom of speech, freedom of press, governments are answerable to the governed, and they are labeled as “radicals” and “terrorists”. Could that be the point when we know things have been all but lost and the time for revolution is at hand? When we see those we elected to do right by us and ensure our own safety and uphold all that we believe to be right turn their backs on the principles of liberty all in the name of corporate profits and personal power.

You cannot limit free speech, you cannot deny people fair trials, and you must not use the threat of violence to justify the need for doing these things. Our mark as a civilized nation is not how we act in times of great success and peace, but by how we act when things look their worst. You can judge a nation by how it values its laws and adheres to them when that nation is threatened. Had Americans murdered Germans on the scale that Nazis murdered Jews, all in the name of security and winning the war, history would have painted a drastically different picture of our country. I have served in war, and defended myself and my brothers from violence, but I would be remised to think that I was defending my country. We are at the end of a war that has cost us countless lives and damaged our image with the rest of the world – something I fear we may never come back from. Every day I am constantly plagued with conflicts of conscience in whether what my country is doing is right. I know that it’s not, but I don’t know what to do. I can continue pursuing my degree and come out of college with a paper that will be worth more than some peoples house but will there be room left to fix the wrongs that are going on now? Or will we as a nation tread so far down the path of moral damnation that any hope of seeing light will have forever been lost?

[**DROPBOX MIRROR OF THE .XLSX FILE**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73h1pk6xx7wxzoi/Surveillance_For_Reddit%202%20-%20Copy.xlsx).

**EDIT**:  Getting questions about accessing the data.  Click 'file - > download' to save a .xlsx spreadsheet to your hard drive for easy manipulation.

The list includes congressional members' names, party, chamber (house or senate), and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy, and a low intrusion score means they have done less damage (or acted to protect our privacy).

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn), other data I assembled myself.  If you see an error (and there will be errors) let me know or correct it yourself if possible.

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab, which contains all of the data.

**Key**:  This is the second tab, which explains the column headings in the master list.

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the Holt ['Repeal the Surveillance State Act'](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2818#overview) is sitting in committee.  I have ranked the House Judiciary Committee (roughly) by the priority with which they should be contacted, and included my reasoning and their DC office numbers.  The higher the name on the list (ideally), the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What You Can Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above, and I've also copied the names and numbers below.

When you dial the number, you'll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes.  Wasting your breath with long-winded discussion helps no one.  Keep it as clear and simple as possible, and be kind to the person you're talking to; they control whether your message goes up the chain.

""Hi, I'm calling to ask representative X to support Rep. Holt's 'repeal the surveillance state act, HR 2818.  I'm very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore.  Please pass my message along to the representative.""

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, don't provide it.  

If you are a constituent, make sure they get your zip code.  

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, say, ""I'm calling Rep. [X] in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again, keep it brief.  Ask them to support Holt's 'Repeal the Surveillance State Act, HR 2818'.



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, you are (doubling, tripling, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation, how to talk to interns (as I explained to you above), then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to 100% success.

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, claim it's your brilliant idea, or link people directly to this post.  Change it however you want.  Just share this information (Facebook, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

Reddit we need to understand that we are an open community which means there are people posting in these threads that are paid to spin the conversation away from the real issue. It is causing us to waffel on the issue at hand. If you have nothing to add to the conversation then please don't post so we can see those individuals that are spinning the conversation. Otherwise do everything you can activist wise to help our cause. No cynics, pessimists, detractors please. 

CISPA could allow any private company to share vast amounts of sensitive, private data about its customers with the government.

CISPA would override all other federal and state privacy laws, and allow a private company to share nearly anything—from the contents of private emails and Internet browsing history to medical, educational and financial records—as long as it “directly pertains to” a “cyber threat,” which is broadly defined.

CISPA does not require that data shared with the government be stripped of unnecessary personally-identifiable information. A private company may choose to anonymize the data it shares with the government. However, there is no requirement that it does so—even when personally-identifiable information is unnecessary for cybersecurity measures. For example, emails could be shared with the full names of their authors and recipients. A company could decide to leave the names of its customers in the data it shares with the government merely because it does not want to incur the expense of deleting them. This is contrary to the recommendations of the House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force and other bills to authorize information sharing, which require companies to make a reasonable effort to minimize the sharing of personally-identifiable information.

CISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity. The government could use any information it receives for “any lawful purpose” besides “regulatory purposes,” so long as the same use can also be justified by cybersecurity or the protection of national security. This would provide no meaningful limit—a government official could easily create a connection to “national security” to justify nearly any type of investigation.

CISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks. ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a “cybersecurity system,” regardless of any other privacy or telecommunications law.

CISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect information about domestic Internet users. Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security. CISPA contains no such limitation. Instead, the Department of Defense and the NSA could solicit and receive information directly from American companies, about users and systems inside the United States.

CISPA places too much faith in private companies, to safeguard their most sensitive customer data from government intrusion. While information sharing would be voluntary under CISPA, the government has a variety of ways to pressure private companies to share large volumes of customer information. With complete legal immunity, private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure. There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government, either before or after the fact. As informed consumers, Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies, telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data, so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our business.

The competing narratives:

**US/Ukraine:**

MH17 was deliberately shot down by Russian military units either from Russian or Ukrainian territory.

Evidence:

* BUK missiles are made in Russia
* Photos of Russian BUK missile launchers
* Photos/video of BUK missile launchers being fired
* Everyone knows that the Russian are a bunch of baby eating killers. What more proof do you need than that? /s

**Russia:**

MH17 was deliberately shot down by Ukrainian military units

Evidence:

* Ukraine has lots of BUK missiles
* Photos of Ukrainian BUK missile launchers
* Photos/video of BUK missile launchers being fired
* Everyone knows that the Ukrainians are a bunch of baby eating killers. What more proof do you need than that? /s

**Independent press, governments that are not the US, Russia or Ukraine:**

MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile battery captured from the Ukrainian army by pro-Russia separatists. The separatists believed they were firing on a Ukrainian military transport.

Evidence:

* Ukraine is a former SSR. Most of their equipment is Russian made. Including BUK's of which they have a lot
* During the first year of the Ukrainian conflict separatists made steady advances. Ukrainian leadership was in disarray, troops were demoralized and logistics were in chaos. Many Ukrainian units were overrun and their equipment captured. Including BUK's.
* Five years later I have trouble finding the same photo I saw in 2014. It featured a clearly marked Ukrainian army BUK manned by separatists not wearing uniforms. The photo does exist and their is no logical reason to believe it isn't true. I did find one image of a BUK with several individuals wearing camo jackets and blue jeans but it was unsourced so I don't know where or when it was taken.
* Prior to MH17 separatists shot down a Ukrainian military transport using a BUK. They proudly took credit for it and they were not contradicted by Ukraine.
* Immediately after MH17 was shot down, separatists announced over radio and social media that they shot down another Ukrainian military transport. They received many congratulatory replies. Until they got word to stop talking about it because maybe that wasn't a Ukrainian transport after all.
* Every nation with an interest in the conflict monitors radio communications in the zone. If the US NSA can keep a recording of every phone call I ever made then they have a transcript of those radio transmissions. The press was informed of tis in 2014 but later their sources clammed up as contradictory narratives arose.
* The credibility of the competing sources. From Polonium poisoning to ""weapons of mass destruction"", given the long history of demonstrably false narratives and propaganda from Russia and the US the obvious question is not whether they are lying but whether they are even capable of telling the truth.
* In truth, neither the Russians or Ukrainians are baby eating killers. Except for Andrei Chikatilo of course. Feel free to debate whether he was Ukrainian or Russian.",geopolitics,NSA
2,Analysis of Russia's Information War,101.0,50ioyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/50ioyi/analysis_of_russias_information_war/,41.0,1472667997.0,"This post will discuss Russia's use of black/white propaganda.

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

That unit was part of Ukraine's Interior Ministry until Crimea's March 2014 annexation, upon which the Crimean Berkut was incorporated into Russia's Interior Ministry. CyberBerkut's ""Ukrainian identity"" is vigorously asserted, however, as it postures as an internal opposition group. 

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

Here's a good article to read: [The pro-Russian Disinformation Campaign

I see from reddit.com/r/The_Donald that you people already hate Soros (links often lead to Russian disinformation websites) and think NATO should turn into a protection racket, ignoring basic hegemonic theory and forward deployment strategy of the U.S. near Russia and China. 

As an example, take a look at this conspiracy theory (and irrational) self post from /r/The_Donald: 

>[Is it just me or does it seem kind of funny that whenever there's emails leaked of people in the Clintons circle a shooting or riot comes up to distract people right after the leaks happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4xnree/major_leak_hurts_clinton_campaign_blm_riots/)

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

For now, read some of this history regarding Soviet Active Measures (relevant to our current situation):

In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

He frequently re-tweets WikiLeaks, just like DCLeaks. He re-tweets and follows conspiracy theory outlets like Alex Jones and Roger Stone, just like DCLeaks followed RT and PressTV. Of course, he sprang back to life two days ago, right before Election Day, to complain about ""Democrats rigging the election."" I thought he didn't favour any political party?

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites?

>TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight. But first questions.

>Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing “Free Press” is not being “Free as in free beer” or “Free as in free of government influence?

>Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

Iran: The Next War

Even before the bombs fell on Baghdad, a group of senior
Pentagon officials were plotting to invade another
country. Their covert campaign once again relied on false
intelligence and shady allies. But this time, the target
was Iran. BY JAMES BAMFORD

I. The Israeli Connection

A few blocks off Pennsylvania Avenue, the FBI’s eight-
story Washington field office exudes all the charm of a
maximum-security prison. Its curved roof is made of thick
stainless steel, the bottom three floors are wrapped in
granite and limestone, hydraulic bollards protect the ramp
to the four-floor garage, and bulletproof security booths
guard the entrance to the narrow lobby. On the fourth
floor, like a tomb within a tomb, lies the most secret
room in the $100 million concrete fortress—out-of-bounds
even for special agents without an escort. Here, in the
Language Services Section, hundreds of linguists in padded
earphones sit elbow-to-elbow in long rows, tapping
computer keyboards as they eavesdrop on the phone lines of
foreign embassies and other high-priority targets in the
nation’s capital.

At the far end of that room, on the morning of February
12th, 2003, a small group of eavesdroppers were listening
intently for evidence of a treacherous crime. At the very
moment that American forces were massing for an invasion
of Iraq, there were indications that a rogue group of
senior Pentagon officials were already conspiring to push
the United States into another war—this time with Iran.

A few miles away, FBI agents watched as Larry Franklin, an
Iran expert and career employee of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, drove up to the Ritz-Carlton hotel
across the Potomac from Washington. A trim man of fifty-
six, with a tangle of blond hair speckled gray, Franklin
had left his modest home in Kearneysville, West Virginia,
shortly before dawn that morning to make the eighty-mile
commute to his job at the Pentagon. Since 2002, he had
been working in the Office of Special Plans, a crowded
warren of blue cubicles on the building’s fifth floor. A
secretive unit responsible for long-term planning and
propaganda for the invasion of Iraq, the office’s staffers
referred to themselves as ""the cabal."" They reported to
Douglas Feith, the third-most-powerful official in the
Defense Department, helping to concoct the fraudulent
intelligence reports that were driving America to war in
Iraq.

Just two weeks before, in his State of the Union address,
President Bush had begun laying the groundwork for the
invasion, falsely claiming that Saddam Hussein had the
means to produce tens of thousands of biological and
chemical weapons, including anthrax, botulinum toxin,
sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. But an attack on Iraq
would require something that alarmed Franklin and other
neoconservatives almost as much as weapons of mass
destruction: detente with Iran. As political columnist
David Broder reported in The Washington Post, moderates in
the Bush administration were ""covertly negotiating for
Iran to stay quiet and offer help to refugees when we go
into Iraq.""

Franklin—a devout neoconservative who had been brought
into Feith’s office because of his political beliefs—was
hoping to undermine those talks. As FBI agents looked on,
Franklin entered the restaurant at the Ritz and joined two
other Americans who were also looking for ways to push the
U.S. into a war with Iran. One was Steven Rosen, one of
the most influential lobbyists in Washington. Sixty years
old and nearly bald, with dark eyebrows and a seemingly
permanent frown, Rosen was director of foreign-policy
issues at Israel’s powerful lobby, the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee. Seated next to Rosen was AIPAC’s
Iran expert, Keith Weissman. He and Rosen had been working
together closely for a decade to pressure U.S. officials
and members of Congress to turn up the heat on Tehran.

Over breakfast at the Ritz-Carlton, Franklin told the two
lobbyists about a draft of a top-secret National Security
Presidential Directive that dealt with U.S. policy on
Iran. Crafted by Michael Rubin, the desk officer for Iraq
and Iran in Feith’s office, the document called, in
essence, for regime change in Iran. In the Pentagon’s
view, according to one senior official there at the time,
Iran was nothing but ""a house of cards ready to be pushed
over the precipice."" So far, though, the White House had
rejected the Pentagon’s plan, favoring the State
Department’s more moderate position of diplomacy. Now,
unwilling to play by the rules any longer, Franklin was
taking the extraordinary—and illegal—step of passing on
highly classified information to lobbyists for a foreign
state. Unable to win the internal battle over Iran being
waged within the administration, a member of Feith’s
secret unit in the Pentagon was effectively resorting to
treason, recruiting AIPAC to use its enormous influence to
pressure the president into adopting the draft directive
and wage war against Iran.

It was a role that AIPAC was eager to play. Rosen,
recognizing that Franklin could serve as a useful spy,
immediately began plotting ways to plant him in the White
House—specifically in the National Security Council, the
epicenter of intelligence and national-security policy. By
working there, Rosen told Franklin a few days later, he
would be ""by the elbow of the president.""

Knowing that such a maneuver was well within AIPAC’s
capabilities, Franklin asked Rosen to ""put in a good word""
for him. Rosen agreed. ""I’ll do what I can,"" he said,
adding that the breakfast meeting had been a real ""eye-
opener.""

Working together, the two men hoped to sell the United
States on yet another bloody war. A few miles away,
digital recorders at the FBI’s Language Services Section
captured every word.

II. The Guru and the Exile

In recent weeks, the attacks by Hezbollah on Israel have
given neoconservatives in the Bush administration the
pretext they were seeking to launch what former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich calls ""World War III."" Denouncing
the bombings as ""Iran’s proxy war,"" William Kristol of The
Weekly Standard is urging the Pentagon to counter ""this
act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against
Iranian nuclear facilities."" According to Joseph
Cirincione, an arms expert and the author of Deadly
Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats, ""The
neoconservatives are now hoping to use the Israeli-Lebanon
conflict as the trigger to launch a U.S. war against
Syria, Iran or both.""

The White House accuses Iran and its president, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, of developing WMDs and posing ""a grave
threat"" — the exact same pretexts it used to invade Iraq.

But the Bush administration’s hostility toward Iran is not
simply an outgrowth of the current crisis. War with Iran
has been in the works for the past five years, shaped in
almost complete secrecy by a small group of senior
Pentagon officials attached to the Office of Special
Plans. The man who created the OSP was Douglas Feith, the
undersecretary of defense for policy. A former Middle East
specialist on the National Security Council in the Reagan
administration, Feith had long urged Israel to secure its
borders in the Middle East by attacking Iraq and Iran.
After Bush’s election, Feith went to work to make that
vision a reality, putting together a team of
neoconservative hawks determined to drive the U.S. to
attack Tehran. Before Bush had been in office a year,
Feith’s team had arranged a covert meeting in Rome with a
group of Iranians to discuss their clandestine help.

The meeting was arranged by Michael Ledeen, a member of
the cabal brought aboard by Feith because of his
connections in Iran. Described by The Jerusalem Post
as ""Washington’s neoconservative guru,"" Ledeen grew up in
California during the 1940s. His father designed the air-
conditioning system for Walt Disney Studios, and Ledeen
spent much of his early life surrounded by a world of
fantasy. ""All through my childhood we were an adjunct of
the Disney universe,"" he once recalled. ""According to
family legend, my mother was the model for Snow White, and
we have a picture of her that does indeed look just like
the movie character.""

In 1977, after earning a Ph.D. in history and philosophy
and teaching in Rome for two years, Ledeen became the
first executive director of the Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs, a pro-Israel pressure group
that served as a flagship of the neoconservative movement.
A few years later, after Reagan was elected, Ledeen had
become prominent enough to earn a spot as a consultant to
the National Security Council alongside Feith. There he
played a central role in the worst scandal of Reagan’s
presidency: the covert deal to provide arms to Iran in
exchange for American hostages being held in Lebanon.
Ledeen served as the administration’s intermediary with
Israel in the illegal-arms deal. In 1985, he met with
Manucher Ghorbanifar, a one-time Iranian carpet salesman
who was widely believed to be an Israeli agent. The CIA
considered Ghorbanifar a dangerous con man and had issued
a ""burn notice"" recommending that no U.S. agency have any
dealings with him. Unfazed, Ledeen called Ghorbanifar ""one
of the most honest, educated, honorable men I have ever
known."" The two men brokered the arms exchange—a
transaction that would result in the indictment of
fourteen senior officials in the Reagan administration.

""It was awful—you know, bad things happened,"" Ledeen says
now. ""When Iran-Contra was over, I said, ?Boy, I’m never
going to touch Iran again.’ ""

But in 2001, soon after he arrived at the Pentagon, Ledeen
once again met with Ghorbanifar. This time, instead of
selling missiles to the Iranian regime, the two men were
exploring how best to topple it.

""The meeting in Rome came about because my friend Manucher
Ghorbanifar called me up,"" Ledeen says. Stout and balding,
with a scruffy white beard, Ledeen is sitting in the
living room of his white-brick home in Chevy Chase,
Maryland, smoking a Dominican cigar. His Airedale terrier,
Thurber, roams the room protectively. In his first
extensive interview about the covert Pentagon operation,
Ledeen makes no secret of his desire to topple the
government in Tehran. ""I want to bring down the regime,""
he says. ""I want the regime gone. It’s a country that is
fanatically devoted to our destruction.""

When Ghorbanifar called Ledeen in the fall of 2001, he
claimed, as he often does, to have explosive intelligence
that was vital to U.S. interests. ""There are Iranians who
have firsthand information about Iranian plans to kill
Americans in Afghanistan,"" he told Ledeen. ""Does anyone
want to hear about it?""

Ledeen took the information to Stephen Hadley, the deputy
national security adviser at the White House. ""I know
you’re going to throw me out of the office,"" Ledeen told
him, ""and if I were you I would throw me out of the office
too. But I promised that I would give you this option.
Ghorbanifar has called me. He said these people are
willing to come. Do you want anybody to go and talk to
them?""

Hadley was interested. So was Zalmay Khalilzad, then the
point man on Near East issues for the National Security
Council and now the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad. ""I think
we have to do this, we have to hear this,"" Hadley said.
Ledeen had the green light: As he puts it, ""Every element
of the American government knew this was going to happen
in advance.""

III. The Meeting in Rome

Weeks later, in December, a plane carrying Ledeen traveled
to Rome with two other members of Feith’s secret Pentagon
unit: Larry Franklin and Harold Rhode, a protégé of Ledeen
who has been called the ""theoretician of the neocon
movement."" A specialist on Islam who speaks Hebrew,
Arabic, Turkish and Farsi, Rhode had experience with shady
exiles like Ghorbanifar: He was close to Ahmed Chalabi,
the Iraqi dissident whose discredited intelligence helped
drive the Bush administration to invade Baghdad. According
to UPI, Rhode himself was later observed by CIA operatives
passing ""mind-boggling"" intelligence to Israel, including
sensitive information about U.S. military deployments in
Iraq.

attended the meeting in Rome, has pleaded guilty to

lobbying group. (photo: AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)

Completing the rogues’ gallery that assembled in Rome that
day was the man who helped Ledeen arrange the meeting:
Nicolò Pollari, the director of Italy’s military
intelligence. Only two months earlier, Pollari had
informed the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had
obtained uranium from West Africa—a key piece of false
intelligence that Bush used to justify the invasion of
Iraq.

To hide the shadowy rendezvous in Rome, Pollari provided a
well-protected safe house near the noisy espresso bars and
busy trattorias that surround the Piazza di Spagna in
central Rome. ""It was in a private apartment,"" Ledeen
recalls. ""It was fucking freezing—it was unheated."" The
Pentagon operatives and the men from Iran sat at a dining-
room table strewn with demitasse cups of blackish coffee,
ashtrays littered with crushed cigarette butts and
detailed maps of Iran, Iraq and Syria. ""They gave us
information about the location and plans of Iranian
terrorists who were going to kill Americans,"" Ledeen says.

Ledeen insists the intelligence was on the mark. ""It was
true,"" he says. ""The information was accurate."" Not
according to his boss. ""There wasn’t anything there that
was of substance or of value that needed to be pursued
further,"" Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later
conceded. ""It went nowhere.""

The men then turned their attention to their larger goal:
regime change in Iran. Ghorbanifar suggested funding the
overthrow of the Iranian government using hundreds of
millions of dollars in cash supposedly hidden by Saddam
Hussein. He even hinted that Saddam was hiding in Iran.

Ledeen, Franklin and Rhode were taking a page from Feith’s
playbook on Iraq: They needed a front group of exiles and
dissidents to call for the overthrow of Iran. According to
sources familiar with the meeting, the Americans discussed
joining forces with the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an anti-Iranian
guerrilla army operating out of Iraq.

There was only one small problem: The MEK had been
certified by the State Department as a terrorist
organization. In fact, the White House was in the midst of
negotiations with Tehran, which was offering to extradite
five members of Al Qaeda thought to be of high
intelligence value in return for Washington’s promise to
drop all support for the MEK.

Ledeen denies any dealings with the group. ""I wouldn’t get
within a hundred miles of the MEK,"" he says. ""They have no
following, no legitimacy."" But neoconservatives were eager
to undermine any deal that involved cooperating with Iran.
To the neocons, the value of the MEK as a weapon against
Tehran greatly outweighed any benefit that might be
derived from interrogating the Al Qaeda operatives—even
though they might provide intelligence on future terrorist
attacks, as well as clues to the whereabouts of Osama bin
Laden.

Ledeen and his Pentagon cabal were not the only American
officials to whom Ghorbanifar tried to funnel false
intelligence on Iran. Last year, Rep. Curt Weldon, a
Republican from Pennsylvania, claimed he had intelligence—
from an ""impeccable clandestine source"" he code-
named ""Ali""—that the Iranian government was plotting to
launch attacks against the United States. But when the CIA
investigated the allegations, it turned out that Ali was
Fereidoun Mahdavi, an Iranian exile who was serving as a
frontman for Ghorbanifar and trying to shake down the CIA
for $150,000. ""He is a fabricator,"" said Bill Murray, the
former CIA station chief in Paris. Weldon was furious: The
agency had dismissed Ali, he insisted, ""because they want
to avoid, at all costs, drawing the United States into a
war with Iran.""

After the Rome rendezvous, Ledeen and Ghorbanifar
continued to meet several times a year, often for a day or
two at a time. Rhode also met with Ghorbanifar in Paris,
and the Iranian phoned or faxed his Pentagon contacts
almost every day. At one point Ledeen notified the
Pentagon that Ghorbanifar knew of highly enriched uranium
being moved from Iraq to Iran. At another point, in 2003,
he claimed that Tehran was only a few months away from
exploding a nuclear bomb—even though international experts
estimate that Iran is years away from developing nuclear
weapons. But the accuracy of the reports wasn’t important—
what mattered was their value in drumming up support for
war. It was Iraq all over again.

IV. On the Trail of Mr. X

Such covert efforts by Feith’s team in the Pentagon
started to have the desired effect. In November 2003,
Rumsfeld approved a plan known as CONPLAN 8022-02, which
for the first time established a pre-emptive-strike
capability against Iran. That was followed in 2004 by a
top-secret ""Interim Global Strike Alert Order"" that put
the military on a state of readiness to launch an airborne
and missile attack against Iran, should Bush issue the
command. ""We’re now at the point where we are essentially
on alert,"" said Lt. Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of the
8th Air Force. ""We have the capacity to plan and execute
global strikes in half a day or less.""

But as the Pentagon moved the country closer to war with
Iran, the FBI was expanding its investigation of AIPAC and
its role in the plot. David Szady, then the bureau’s top
spy-catcher, had become convinced that at least one
American citizen working inside the U.S. government was
spying for Israel. ""It’s no longer just our traditional
adversaries who want to steal our secrets, but sometimes
even our allies,"" Szady declared. ""The threat is
incredibly serious."" To locate the spy sometimes referred
to as Mr. X, agents working for Szady began focusing on a
small group of neoconservatives in the Pentagon—including
Feith, Ledeen and Rhode.

The FBI also had its sights on Larry Franklin, who
continued to hold clandestine meetings with Rosen at
AIPAC. Apparently nervous that the FBI might be on to
them, the two men started taking precautions. On March
10th, 2003, barely a week before the invasion of Iraq,
Rosen met Franklin in Washington’s cavernous Union
Station. The pair met at one restaurant, then they hustled
to another, and finally they ended up in a third—this one
totally empty. As an added precaution, Franklin also began
sending faxes to Rosen’s home instead of to his AIPAC
offices.

A few days later, Rosen and Weissman passed on to Israeli-
embassy officials details about the draft of the top-
secret presidential directive on Iran, saying they had
received the document from a ""friend of ours in the
Pentagon."" They also relayed to the Israelis details about
internal Bush-administration discussions on Iran. Then,
two days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rosen leaked
the information to the press with the comment ""I’m not
supposed to know this."" The Washington Post eventually
published the story under the headline ""Pressure Builds
for President to Declare Strategy on Iran,"" crediting the
classified information to ""well-placed sources."" The story
mentioned Ledeen, who helped found the Coalition for
Democracy in Iran, a pressure group dedicated to the
overthrow of the Iranian government, but gave no
indication that the leak had come from someone with a
definite agenda for planting the information.

That June, Weissman called Franklin and left a message
that he and Rosen wanted to meet with him again and talk
about ""our favorite country."" The meeting took place in
the Tivoli Restaurant, a dimly lit establishment two
floors above the metro station in Arlington that was
frequently used by intelligence types for quiet
rendezvous. Over lunch in the mirrored dining room, the
three men discussed the Post article, and Rosen
acknowledged ""the constraints"" Franklin was under to meet
with them. But the Pentagon official placed himself fully
at AIPAC’s disposal. ""You set the agenda,"" Franklin told
Rosen.

In addition to meeting Rosen and Weissman, Franklin was
also getting together regularly with Naor Gilon, an
Israeli embassy official who, according to a senior U.S.
counterintelligence official, ""showed every sign of being
an intelligence agent."" Franklin and Gilon would normally
meet amid the weight machines and punching bags at the
Pentagon Officers Athletic Club, where Franklin passed
along secret information regarding Iran’s activities in
Iraq, its missile-testing program and even, apparently,
New York Times reporter Judith Miller. At one point, Gilon
suggested that Franklin meet with Uzi Arad, Mossad’s
former director of intelligence and former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign-policy adviser. A week later,
Franklin had lunch in the Pentagon cafeteria with the
former top Israeli spy.

V. Iran’s Double Agent

Larry Franklin, it turns out, wasn’t the only person
involved in the Pentagon’s covert operation who was
exchanging state secrets with other governments. As the
FBI monitored Franklin and his clandestine dealings with
AIPAC, it was also investigating another explosive case of
espionage linked to Feith’s office and Iran. This one
focused on Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National
Congress, the militant anti-Saddam opposition group that
had worked for more than a decade to pressure the U.S.
into invading Iraq.

For years, the National Security Agency had possessed the
codes used by Iran to encrypt its diplomatic messages,
enabling the U.S. government to eavesdrop on virtually
every communication between Tehran and its embassies.
After the U.S. invaded Baghdad, the NSA used the codes to
listen in on details of Iran’s covert operations inside
Iraq. But in 2004, the agency intercepted a series of
urgent messages from the Iranian embassy in Baghdad.
Intelligence officials at the embassy had discovered the
massive security breach—tipped off by someone familiar
with the U.S. code-breaking operation.

The blow to intelligence-gathering could not have come at
a worse time. The Bush administration suspected that the
Shiite government in Iran was aiding Shiite insurgents in
Iraq, who were killing U.S. soldiers. The administration
was also worried that Tehran was secretly developing
nuclear weapons. Now, crucial intelligence that might have
shed light on those operations had been cut off,
potentially endangering American lives.

On May 20th, shortly after the discovery of the leak,
Iraqi police backed by American soldiers raided Chalabi’s
home and offices in Baghdad. The FBI suspected that
Chalabi, a Shiite who had a luxurious villa in Tehran and
was close to senior Iranian officials, was actually
working as a spy for the Shiite government of Iran.
Getting the U.S. to invade Iraq was apparently part of a
plan to install a pro-Iranian Shiite government in
Baghdad, with Chalabi in charge. The bureau also suspected
that Chalabi’s intelligence chief had furnished Iran with
highly classified information on U.S. troop movements, top-
secret communications, plans of the provisional government
and other closely guarded material on U.S. operations in
Iraq. On the night of the raid, The CBS Evening News
carried an exclusive report by correspondent Lesley Stahl
that the U.S. government had ""rock-solid"" evidence that
Chalabi had been passing extremely sensitive intelligence
to Iran—evidence so sensitive that it could ""get Americans
killed.""

The revelation shocked Franklin and other members of
Feith’s office. If true, the allegations meant that they
had just launched a war to put into power an agent of
their mortal enemy, Iran. Their man—the dissident leader
who sat behind the first lady in the president’s box
during the State of the Union address in which Bush
prepared the country for war—appeared to have been working
for Iran all along.

Franklin needed to control the damage, and fast. He was
one of the very few in the government who knew that it was
the NSA code-breaking information that Chalabi was
suspected of passing to Iran, and that there was absolute
proof that Chalabi had met with a covert Iranian agent
involved in operations against the U.S. To protect those
in the Pentagon working for regime change in Tehran,
Franklin needed to get out a simple message: We didn’t
know about Chalabi’s secret dealings with Iran.

Franklin decided to leak the information to a friendly
contact in the media: Adam Ciralsky, a CBS producer who
had been fired from the CIA, allegedly for his close ties
to Israel. On May 21st, the day after CBS broadcast its
exclusive report on Chalabi, Franklin phoned Ciralsky and
fed him the information. As the two men talked,
eavesdroppers at the FBI’s Washington field office
recorded the conversation.

That night, Stahl followed up her original report
with ""new details""—the information leaked earlier that day
by Franklin. She began, however, by making clear that she
would not divulge the most explosive detail of all: the
fact that Chalabi had wrecked the NSA’s ability to
eavesdrop on Iran. ""Senior intelligence officials were
stressing today that the information Ahmed Chalabi is
alleged to have passed on to Iran is so seriously
sensitive that the result of full disclosure would be
highly damaging to U.S. security,"" Stahl said. ""Because of
that, we are not reporting the details of what exactly
Chalabi is said to have compromised, at the request of
U.S. officials at the highest levels. The information
involves secrets that were held by only a handful of very
senior intelligence officials."" Thanks to the pressure
from the administration, the public was prevented from
learning the most damaging aspect of Chalabi’s treachery.

Then Stahl moved on to Franklin’s central
message. ""Meanwhile,"" she said, ""we have been told that
grave concerns about the true nature of Chalabi’s
relationship with Iran started after the U.S. obtained,
quote, ?undeniable intelligence’ that Chalabi met with a
senior Iranian intelligence officer, a, quote, ?nefarious
figure from the dark side of the regime, an individual
with a direct hand in covert operations against the United
States.’ Chalabi never reported this meeting to anyone in
the U.S. government, including his friends and sponsors.""
In short, the Pentagon—and Feith’s office in particular—
was blameless.

VI. The Cabal’s Triumph

Soon after the broadcast, David Szady’s team at the FBI
decided to wrap up its investigation before Franklin
leaked any more information. Agents quietly confronted
Franklin with the taped phone call and pressured him to
cooperate in a sting operation directed at AIPAC and
members of Feith’s team in the Pentagon. Franklin, facing
a long prison sentence, agreed. On August 4th, 2005, Rosen
and Weissman were indicted, and on January 20th, 2006,
Franklin, who had earlier pleaded guilty, was sentenced to
twelve years and seven months in prison. In an attempt to
reduce his sentence, he agreed to testify against the
former AIPAC officials. The case is set to go to trial
this fall.

So far, however, Franklin is the only member of Feith’s
team to face charges. The continuing lack of indictments
demonstrates how frighteningly easy it is for a small
group of government officials to join forces with agents
of foreign powers—whether it is AIPAC or the MEK or the
INC—to sell the country on a disastrous war.

The most glaring unindicted co-conspirator is Ahmed
Chalabi. Even top-ranking Republicans suspect him of
double dealing: ""I wouldn’t be surprised if he told
Iranians facts, issues, whatever, that we did not want
them to know,"" said Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., who chairs
the House subcommittee on national security. Yet the FBI
has been unable to so much as question Chalabi as part of
its ongoing espionage case. Last November, when Chalabi
returned to the United States for a series of speeches and
media events, the FBI tried to interview him. But because
he was under State Department protection during his visit,
sources in the Justice Department say, the bureau’s
request was flatly denied.

""Chalabi’s running around saying, ?I have nothing to
hide,’ "" says one senior FBI official. ""Yet he’s using our
State Department to keep us from him at the same time. And
we’ve got to keep our mouth shut.""

In the end, the work of Franklin and the other members of
Feith’s secret office had the desired effect. Working
behind the scenes, the members of the Office of Special
Plans succeeded in setting the United States on the path
to all-out war with Iran. Indeed, since Bush was re-
elected to a second term, he has made no secret of his
desire to see Tehran fall. In a victory speech of sorts on
Inauguration Day in January 2005, Vice President Dick
Cheney warned bluntly that Iran was ""right at the top"" of
the administration’s list of ""trouble spots""—and that
Israel ""might well decide to act first"" by attacking Iran.
The Israelis, Cheney added in an obvious swipe at
moderates in the State Department, would ""let the rest of
the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess
afterward.""

Over the past six months, the administration has adopted
almost all of the hard-line stance advocated by the war
cabal in the Pentagon. In May, Bush’s ambassador to the
United Nations, John Bolton, appeared before AIPAC’s
annual conference and warned that Iran ""must be made aware
that if it continues down the path of international
isolation, there will be tangible and painful
consequences."" To back up the tough talk, the State
Department is spending $66 million to promote political
change inside Iran—funding the same kind of dissident
groups that helped drive the U.S. to war in Iraq. ""We may
face no greater challenge from a single country than from
Iran,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared.

In addition, the State Department recently beefed up its
Iran Desk from two people to ten, hired more Farsi
speakers and set up eight intelligence units in foreign
countries to focus on Iran. The administration’s National
Security Strategy—the official policy document that sets
out U.S. strategic priorities—now calls Iran the ""single
country"" that most threatens U.S. interests.

The shift in official policy has thrilled former members
of the cabal. To them, the war in Lebanon represents the
final step in their plan to turn Iran into the next Iraq.
Ledeen, writing in the National Review on July 13th, could
hardly restrain himself. ""Faster, please,"" he urged the
White House, arguing that the war should now be taken over
by the U.S. military and expanded across the entire
region. ""The only way we are going to win this war is to
bring down those regimes in Tehran and Damascus, and they
are not going to fall as a result of fighting between
their terrorist proxies in Gaza and Lebanon on the one
hand, and Israel on the other. Only the United States can
accomplish it,"" he concluded. ""There is no other way.""

Here are some of mine (heavily Russia/Ukraine-focused as that's where my interests lie):

---


**U.S. Domestic and International Policy**

[Doug Bandow](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/#219a58dc6ba5) - Critic of U.S. foreign policy, specially towards Russia. Bit of an isolationist.

[Bill Gertz](http://freebeacon.com/author/bill-gertz/)

---

**Pro-Russian**

[Alexander Mercouris](http://theduran.com/author/alexander/) - Lawyer and Russia watcher. Frequently appears on RT. His [old blog](https://mercouris.wordpress.com) has some good stuff about Libya and highly-detailed analyses of high-profile legal cases in which Russia has been accused by the West of implementing for political reasons (which he debunks) e.g. about Alexei Navalny, Sergei Magnitsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, etc. **Highly recommended.**

[Anatoly Karlin](http://www.unz.com/author/anatoly-karlin/) - Russia watcher and debunker of common Western tropes about Russia. Also has a [blog](http://akarlin.com) which contains some good stuff about Russia.

[Paul Robinson](https://irrussianality.wordpress.com) - Canadian historian of Russia but has good commentary about geopolitics sometimes

---

**Critical of Russia** - MSM has a lack of valid criticism about Russia so these guys are relatively unknown


[Anton Shekhovtsov](http://anton-shekhovtsov.blogspot.ca) - **Highly recommended.** Posts infrequently, but has done the most in-depth research into Russia's ties with far-right extremists in Europe, and analyzes juicy leaks/hacks of Kremlin insiders' emails/texts.

[Christo Grozev](https://cgrozev.wordpress.com) - Another good Russia commentator. Specializes in MH17, Ukraine, counter-intellignence, and Russian intelligence operations. His [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christogrozev?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) has more frequent commentary about Russia. Also **highly recommended**.
 
[Paul Goble](http://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.ca)

[Joel Harding](https://toinformistoinfluence.com) - Takes on Russian disinformation.

---

**Middle East/Israel/Rest of the World**

[M. K. Bhadrakumar](http://blogs.rediff.com/mkbhadrakumar/) - Also posts on [Asia Times](http://atimes.com/author/m-k-bhadrakumar/). Not sure why he has two separate posting locations, but as there is no overlap, make sure you follow both sources. Former Indian ambassador to former USSR states. **Highly recommended.**

[Gregory Clark](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/author/int-gregory_clark/). Also has a [website](http://www.gregoryclark.net) with an archive of all his articles/columns. British-Australian diplomat fluent in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Japanese and specializing in economics, Japanese domestic/international policy and geopolitics. Slightly pro-Russian and critic of anti-China critics.

[Michael Hudson](http://www.counterpunch.org/author/michael-hudson/) - Actually an economist, but tends to talk about it with relation to geopolitics and international relations.

[J. J. Golderg](http://forward.com/author/j-j-goldberg/) - Recently started following him due to a lack of Israel watchers.

[Robert Fisk](http://www.independent.co.uk/author/robert-fisk) - Specializes in Syria and rest of Middle East. Critical of Western policy towards Syria.

[Nafeez Ahmed](https://medium.com/@NafeezAhmed) - Covers international security and far-right forces in Europe.

[John R. Schindler](https://20committee.com) - Former NSA intelligence analyst and counter-intelligence officer. Russia critic. Infamous for being an NSA-apologist and for having his dick pics leaked, but has good ELINT commentary sometimes.

My post follows below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's all an act of aggression against everyone involved. They are just testing the water to see what they are capable of getting away with.

You want a spy movie read? Check this out. It's all from real world events.
If you piece together all the Wikipedia articles about Litvinenko, the Russian Apartment Bombings, Assassinated businessman Boris Berezovsky, Asassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Stratfor Hack which ties multinational corporations to Private Intelligence Corporations, Global Intelligence, Private Security Contractors, Money Laundering to hide the trail of the decision makers, their relations to Wikileaks, Wikilieaks relation to whistleblowers, and Snowden's current situation of being a whistle blower....

Everything starts to get crazy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Russian_apartment_bombings
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stratfor_email_leak

>WikiLeaks founder **Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad,** and especially its targeting of activist organizations.[5] He also called the company a ""shadow CIA"" and stated that the emails would ""reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.""[24]

>Al Akhbar, citing internal emails from the **Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi**, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]

>An email involving **a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.**[11]

>emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, a former **Goldman Sachs director, along with other informants, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets.** They created an offshore ""share structure"" known as ""StratCap"" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations.

Also worth checking out is Russian President Vladimir Putins role in Gazprom the largest natural gas comapany in Europe and one of the largest corporations in the world. 

Here is the type of organization Putin made Gazprom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_champions

>National champion is a political concept in which large corporations in strategic sectors are expected not only to seek profit but also to ""advance the interests of the nation.” This policy has been popular and practiced by many countries.

Next is worth checking out Putin's networth. (Dick Cheney, Haliburton, etc)

Review everything above with past CIA/NSA scandals from the United States at home and abroad and you can see just how fucked up and interwoven everything and everyone in power really is.

As well as *whistleblowers from the World Bank* of which almost every nation is a member. They help move the secretive money around and launder it all.

http://nsnbc.me/2013/06/12/world-bank-whistleblower-karen-hudes-arrainged-to-federal-court-on-13-june/

>**Allied Barton, the International Security Contractor and contractor for security personnel at the World Bank** who was responsible for **Hudes´illegal arrest**, *is owned by members of the same cartel that controls the Bank for International Settlements, 40 percent of the asset value of 43,000 transnational corporations and financial institutions, and 60% of their annual earnings.* http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf

another one - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-lawton/world-bank-whistleblower_b_3350872.html

http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2012/0716/feature-world-bank-robert-zoellick-too-big-to-fail.html

Internal reports, reviewed by FORBES, show, for example, that even after Zoellick implemented a budget freeze some officials operated an off-budget system that defies cost control, while **others used revolving doors to game the system to make fortunes for themselves or enhance their positions within the bank.** Why not track all the cash? 

Good luck: Bank sources cite up to $2 billion that may have gone unaccounted for recently amid computer glitches.

Sadly, the last part is cultural: The bank, those inside and outside it say, **is so obsessed with reputational risk that it reflexively covers up anything that could appear negative, rather than address it. Whistle-blower witch hunts (see box, p. 92) undermine the one sure way to root out problems at a Washington headquarters dominated by fearful** yes-men and yes-women, who–wary of a quick expulsion back to their own countries– rarely offer their true opinions.

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmintdev/writev/402/contents.htm

The UK Serious Fraud Office also called the Securities and Exchange Commission to inquire into the World Bank’s accounting irregularities. Hudes reported to UK Parliament that the SEC stonewalled the Serious Fraud Office.

Edit - Just to note since my comment will probably have a lot of responses I would like you to remember the links posted and their stories and also think about how it's all just so unbelievable that these situations are happening.

*And have been for a while. It just goes to show how much distraction there is and how much pressure is put onto whistleblowers to keep information like these stories from having staying power in the mainstream media.*

Imagine if these were the types of stories the press reported on instead of the stories we get from them now.

\* whether Donald Trump and the Christchurch shooter meant to be racist.
