0,Missing Flight 370,6458.0,iypndt,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iypndt/missing_flight_370/,629.0,1600918774.0,"On March 13, 2018[,](https://imgur.com/a/EId0nRH) a twitter user who went by the name strayedaway, or Ty, posted a thread about a creepy voicemail he received regarding the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The thread went viral and many more people came out claiming to have received the same one.. This prompted people all over the internet to get involved and help solve the mystery. However, there was never a real conclusion, and after receiving an overwhelming amount of publicity and even death threats, Ty and many others linked to the thread deactivated their accounts. Many people claim the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or even an alternate reality game, but I am not satisfied with those answers. Ty’s thread and the bizarre disappearance of MH370 still linger in the back of my mind to this day.

[https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/creepy-military-voicemail-warning-of-impending-doomsday-sends-internet-into-meltdown/news-story/afe34f8dce8d48a0269cd925838743e8](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/creepy-military-voicemail-warning-of-impending-doomsday-sends-internet-into-meltdown/news-story/afe34f8dce8d48a0269cd925838743e8)

For those who are unaware, MH370 was an international flight that disappeared on March 8, 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The voicemail Ty received 4 years later was an SOS message thought to be recorded on the missing plane’s black box. Some said solar flares happening around that time may have allowed the message to be picked up by cellphones. Solar flares cause electromagnetic pulses in the atmosphere, so with increased electromagnetic activity, signals would have been amplified and had a farther range.

The voicemail was a recording of a robotic voice speaking in military code. After twitter investigators deciphered it, they discovered a chilling warning about aliens followed by a string of numbers that turned out to be coordinates close to the place MH370 vanished from radar. Besides the voicemail, there are many more oddities surrounding this event and there seems to be a synchronistic pattern hiding in plane sight. Flight 370, a Boeing 777, left on the 7th day of the 3rd month and Malaysia Airlines is said to fly nearly 37,000 passengers daily.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26492748#:\~:text=Malaysia%27s%20national%20carrier%20is%20one,Jennifer%20Pak%20in%20Kuala%20Lumpur.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26492748#:~:text=Malaysia%27s%20national%20carrier%20is%20one,Jennifer%20Pak%20in%20Kuala%20Lumpur.)

The television show Lost seemed to predict the event as well, 10 years before it happened. In the show, a Boeing 777 deviates from its path, turns around, and disappears somewhere off the coast of Australia. This is exactly what MH370 did. The show also seemed to predict who would be on the plane. In Lost, some of the passengers included an actor and two men who used fake passports. On MH370, there was an actor and two men who used fake passports as well.

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10688861/Mystery-fake-passport-holders-on-flight-MH370-were-Iranian.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10688861/Mystery-fake-passport-holders-on-flight-MH370-were-Iranian.html)

[https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/uncategorized/2014/03/13/marco-polo-stuntman-and-jet-lis-body-double-ju-kun-was-also-on-flight-mh370/](https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/uncategorized/2014/03/13/marco-polo-stuntman-and-jet-lis-body-double-ju-kun-was-also-on-flight-mh370/)

The actor was Ju Kun, Jet Li's body double, and fake identities were used by two Iranian men seeking asylum in Europe. Oddly enough, in Lost, a psychic predicts the plane crash. MH370‘s disappearance also seemed to be predicted by the Nigerian prophet T. B. Joshua. In 2013, T. B. Joshua warned that an aircraft carrying over 200 passengers from an Asian nation would have some serious problems. MH370 had 227 passengers on board. The video of his proclamation went viral on YouTube after the flight’s disappearance.

Another strange synchronicity is Lost was first aired on September 22, 2004. September 22 would turn out to be big day for CERN, exactly 7 years later. If you‘re unaware, CERN is a facility that smashes atoms together to create mini black holes and look for other dimensions. On September 22, 2011, CERN succeeded in sending particles faster than the speed of light. Physicists hypothesize that going faster than light speed could actually result in time travel. However, the claim was supposedly debunked sometime later. But this is still up for debate.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light\_neutrino\_anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly)

But what I find most strange, is the fact that the man who made this discovery was forced to resign. Conspiracy theorists claim CERN did in fact achieve time travel and caused the past to change, a phenomenon known as the Mandela Effect. They say this historical event constantly switches back and forth between having happened on the 22nd or 23rd. Supposedly, every year around this time, new inconsistencies in history pop up.

[https://www.alternatememories.com/historical-events/general/september-22-23-date-anomalies](https://www.alternatememories.com/historical-events/general/september-22-23-date-anomalies)

Ironically, the plot of Lost is centered around a time travel experiment called the Dharma Initiative. In The Lost Experience, it’s revealed that the goal of the experiment was for people to alter the timeline and push back doomsday. Oddly enough, its logo looks just like CERN.

[CERN compared to the Dharma Initiative's logo](https://preview.redd.it/ndc0p030l0p51.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=716d61e3e7e8a0f6735612a38e137b7c60cd7abf)

Coincidentally, The Lost Experience was an alternate reality game. Remember that the voicemail received by Ty was thought to be part of an ARG as well. Similarly, the investigation sparked by Ty’s thread uncovered the date of a supposed doomsday event, April 18, 2018. Many speculated that on this day there would be an alien invasion. Obviously this didn’t happen, but perhaps uncovering the plan pushed back doomsday, like in the Lost game. With UFOs now in the news, the idea of an alien invasion or apocalyptic event seems even more relevant. If you’ve read my other threads, you know I think the apocalypse has something do with something known as the Black Sun. Oddly enough, MH370 also has connections to this concept. The Black Sun is a symbol that some say represents a portal to somewhere beyond space and time. This strange mural dedicated to the disappearance of MH370 depicts the plane flying straight into something resembling a black hole. The portal seems to be luring the passengers inside by telling them to come in.

[\\""Come in!!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/f37r87ggl0p51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3dae44e7f2db8a91d2f78dcbf2857f7e14a48da5)

Another mural seems to depict this as well. In this picture, we see a plane flying right into what appears to be a tear in the fabric of reality. Yet another mural shows the missing flight returning through one. Were the passengers of MH370 taken to another dimension?

[Some questionable murals](https://preview.redd.it/uxrmm5ssl0p51.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f3250cf6424730e3ba0fd7cde9bdbfc29b987bf)

This all seems reminiscent of Donnie Darko, a movie about doomsday, time travel, and a plane falling through a black hole in the sky. Just like in Lost, the main character, who is guided by a demonic humanoid rabbit, is tasked with closing a time loop and stopping the apocalypse. The Black Sun is also symbolic of Saturn, which was known to the ancients as the god of time. Saturn is also famous for having a hexagon on its North Pole. In the painting below, we see MH370 trapped behind a net of hexagons. Were the passengers victims of a Saturnian ritual?

[A literal hex on MH370?](https://preview.redd.it/1s1b4ku2m0p51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a182489ad9d2c85fca865d706d11629b0214d85b)

Even stranger, in Man of Steel, a trident shaped UFO that resembles the Malaysian Airlines logo crashes off the coast of Australia, just like MH370 did. The movie shows the coordinates of the UFO being 37° S 76° E. Here we see more numerology at work. But it gets weirder. If you type in the opposite coordinates, 37° N 76° W, you get the location of King Neptune‘s Park on Virginia Beach. At the park there is a statue of King Neptune holding a trident. The streets leading up to the park, which are adjacent to 33rd Street, form a trident as well.

[Just a coincidence?](https://preview.redd.it/puakh53hm0p51.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71509f27baa5642a6a4a07d068604064a9d8d873)

[Okay, these 'coincidences' are getting a little out of hand.](https://preview.redd.it/k51dd4wkm0p51.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a162979060b767a4507c22ebdb831cd456aebf2)

Ironically, Virginia Beach is an hour drive from Middlesex, the town where Donnie Darko takes place. In Mission Impossible III, another movie centered around chasing a white rabbit, there’s a scene where the Malaysian Airlines logo can be seen from behind, revealing a hidden 666.

[Do you see?!](https://preview.redd.it/tvyfk9bqm0p51.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf23311b5fc9685c97fc224d509dbd97506b8a26)

The same exact scene was also used in the movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The movie is about sun harvesting robots who reside on one of Saturn’s moons. I find it odd they reused the same footage for two films released roughly 3 years apart.

[Hmmm...](https://preview.redd.it/pyfra3jwm0p51.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8feb789f6da2f1197db2c73fa353e2ab0a62ee3b)

The area MH370 went missing was also near one of the 12 Vile Vortices. The Vile Vortices are anomalous regions where the planet’s electromagnetic field is thought to be stronger than usual. The regions are known for UFO activity and strange disappearances of boats and planes. The Devil’s Triangle, better known as The Bermuda Triangle, is one of the most famous Vile Vortices. Oddly enough, on the exact opposite side of the globe, is the region MH370 disappeared. Are these two places somehow connected?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan\_T.\_Sanderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_T._Sanderson)

[The Bermuda Triangle \(right\) and the area MH370 went missing \(left\)](https://preview.redd.it/zx01qrf9n0p51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=890b8e04efa5509a6066a5a0819c3edcc62baea8)

All these connections could be nothing more than a coincidence, but I find them too profound to dismiss. I believe the matrix speaks to us in symbols and I believe it is trying to tell us what really happened to MH370. There is still a lot more to this story and it involves the rabbit symbolism I mentioned briefly. I’ve written about the white rabbit and it’s connection to time travel before, but maybe I will do a part 2 where I go into it in more detail another time. Anyways, as always, thanks for reading.",conspiracy,hoax
1,This is all of the evidence that I have compiled proving that singer Avril Lavigne died circa 2003/2004 and was replaced by a clone/doppleganger.,4672.0,7w3tkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7w3tkf/this_is_all_of_the_evidence_that_i_have_compiled/,641.0,1518084394.0,"I have been sitting on all this for a while now.

**Perhaps you have heard stories in the mainstream media contemplating the massive changes that have taken place over the course of Avril Ramona Lavigne's career, which officially began with the hit song** ***Complicated*** **in 2002.**

**The story goes that Avril had been on her first major tour in support of her smash debut album** ***Let Go*** **when she was suddenly informed of her grandfather passing. As the story goes, Lavigne was extremely unhappy with the newfound pressures of fame. One of the major breaking points that led to her decision to kill herself** ***(whether this was a voluntary act or not is debatable)*** **was an incident where she was ambushed by the paparazzi vying to take her picture in the middle of a small cramped environment** ***(supposedly an underground subway)*** **which led her to realize that fame was a trap. She managed to get away unscathed thanks to the help of her bandmate, Evan Taubenfeld, but had been supposedly psychologically scarred by the incident. The story goes that Avril ended up hanging herself while she was in the middle of recording her follow-up album,** ***Under My Skin.***

**Considering that she had ended up being the biggest star of the year when she debuted in 2002, her label was desperate to let the success of her fledgling career continue. It was then that they resorted to the old playbook of replacing Avril Lavigne with an imposter (the way Paul McCartney had been replaced by William Shepherd (stage name Billy Pepper) who was frontman of the band Billy Pepper & The Pepperpots in 1966) in order to continue her legacy. Just as with The Beatles, Avril's music endured a drastic overhaul in order to fit more in the style with of the new impostor so as to make her feel more comfortable playing her new role. Whereas The Beatles music became more complex with the release of 1967's** ***Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club,*** **Avril's music became decidedly more cheerful and immature with the release of 2007's** ***The Best Damn Thing*** **and its lead single** ***Girlfriend.***

All this information was stumbled upon either by accident, or information was fed to the Avril fanbase from the illuminati (under the pretense of a hoax) from one of her international fansites. In any case, death by hanging always signs of illuminati ritual sacrifice. Robin Williams, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington all died by ""hanging"" as well. 

There are several ways to know this isn't the same Avril Lavigne:
- First a comparison pic between Avril's typical look from the beginning career to Melissa, the girl who portrays her today: http://i.imgur.com/EsEZNYR.jpg

- Her voice has gotten higher over the years. Never heard of puberty causing a person's voice to turn higher than before. 

- **2002:** https://youtu.be/2axL4T3R2ak?t=56
- **2011:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YobX6aQFahU *(Even when she attempts to hit the low notes she can't get her voice to go as deep as ""she"" was able to when she was a teenager)*

- ""Avril"" once did a photoshoot around 2007 with the word Melissa written on her hand: http://i.imgur.com/bqV5tv3.jpg

- Her ears are completely different. Ears are like fingerprints, everybody's is unique. http://i.imgur.com/w51CnzO.jpg

- Her teeth have caps now. The original Avril has a snagtooth on her left canine which is pretty noticeable. The new Avril does kind of look like she has it but it's drastically reduced and her crowns are always shiny now, indicating that it's not her real teeth.

- Her moles & birthmarks have disappeared: http://i.imgur.com/9oecmUF.jpg

- She never ages anymore. The original Avril had terrible skin with big red pimples breaking out everywhere. This new Avril hasn't aged a day in 10 years and her skin has a synthetic waxy look. On the other hand, here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked with problem skin:
http://i.imgur.com/8AUPvVp.jpg

- And here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked without makeup on circa 2002/2003: http://i.imgur.com/CWvMfil.jpg

- Her handwriting changed between 2004 - 2006. Her original handwriting: http://i.imgur.com/dtQoVFG.jpg. New handwriting (which has been used since at least her third album onwards): http://i.imgur.com/r02pls7.jpg

- The original Avril wouldn't be caught dead lipsynching. She used to trash Britney Spears all the time for doing it in 2002. This new Avril lip-synchs all the time and fools her fans into thinking it's live, which is worse than Britney, who lip-synchs but is upfront about it without recording new vocals to fake sounding live. As you can see in this performance, Avril makes a mistake at 02:34 and accidentally says the word ""thinking"" directly into the microphone but no sound comes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uPka1pCSH4

**Once you become familiar with stuff like this, including the ""Paul McCartney Died In 1966"" evidence, it becomes so easy to pinpoint all the signs that indicate an imposter. It's so obvious that all the things people say Avril is a hypocrite for is actually because it's a completely different person playing her now. In fact, nothing about Avril's past history makes sense either. She just so happened to be called up to sing along at a Shania Twain concert, one of her first concerts ever? She just happened to go to California and booked a meeting with LA Reid and got to sing in front of him? Please. These things don't just ""happen"". It seems to me that she was groomed for this from the beginning and replaced when they decided to change her image and mock her fans who bought into it.**",conspiracy,hoax

He was anti- mandate, and pro *choice on vaccines. 

He refused a salary as president, and remains one of the only presidents to LOSE in overall net worth during his presidency.

First president in 40 years to NOT enter us into a conflict (even though it's a sure-fire second-term win.) 

He brokered PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. MORE THAN ONCE, and he was nominated for the Nobel peace prize for it ffs. 

The economy was booming before covid, with the highest unemployment rate for Black Americans EVER RECORDED. 

He capped the profit margins on drug companies for things like insulin, donated more to Black Universities than any other president. Thanks Obama.

You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,hoax

I’ve talked about this subject many times before, but since then I have discovered much more information. So, if you’ve heard some of this before, please bear with me, because by the end you will be mind blown. I honestly think this thread includes some of the most compelling evidence for the Mandela Effect being a real phenomenon.

But first, lets start with the basics. CERN, or the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a massive laboratory in Switzerland. The facility is famous for being home to the world’s largest particle collider and discovering the legendary Higgs Boson, or God Particle, in the summer of 2012. A particle collider is a machine that uses extremely powerful magnetic fields to shoot beams of subatomic particles at each other. These beams travel at nearly the speed of light, and when they collide, scientists are able to see what the universe looked like right after the Big Bang.

[https://home.cern/about](https://home.cern/about)

However, some say the people at CERN are really trying to create a portal to the underworld. This sounds ridiculous, but even the official CERN website says they are looking for dark matter and other dimensions. Sounds a lot like the plot of Stranger Things. The symbolism used by CERN only fuels the speculation of conspiracy theorists. For example, many point out the giant statue of Shiva the Destroyer standing outside. There’s even a video floating around the internet that shows men in black robes doing a ritual sacrifice in front of it.

[Notice the hidden 666 in the CERN logo?](https://preview.redd.it/78x8q5laght41.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c3549010fba4482a75282315b02c54ad426e069)

Snopes says the video is a hoax and that some of the researchers at the facility were just having fun. I don’t always trust Snopes but that’s definitely a possibility. What I really want to know is why the researchers would make a joke about something like this. Watch the video for yourself and decide.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeE3pw4qSbA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeE3pw4qSbA)

Others say CERN is messing with time and changing our past. This is actually not too far fetched to believe if you take into consideration what theoretical physicists say about the speed of light. If an object were to somehow travel faster than it, the object would actually go back in time. Is it possible CERN managed to break the light speed barrier? Wouldn't something going back in time change the past? Most physicists say traveling faster than the speed of light is impossible. However, in 2011 CERN detected an anomalous particle that seemed to do just that. The claim was supposedly debunked and the scientist who announced the discovery was forced to resign. This caused a lot of controversy in the physics community and has been a topic of heated debate ever since. The subject seems to be a trigger, like politics, except for smart people.

But even if didn’t happened on that occasion, is it possible it’s happened other times we aren’t being told about it? Conspiracy theorists claim the Mandela Effect is proof of time manipulation. However, skeptics say it is nothing more than the result of a faulty memory. The Mandela Effect is a term used to describe a situation where many people remember a certain event occurring when it actually didn’t. For example, many people believed Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 80s. However, they were shocked to find out he really died in 2013 and lived a long happy life, hence the name of the phenomenon. The Mandela Effect is noticeable in many logos and cartoons. For example, the Fruit of the Loom logo never had a cornucopia, Curious George never had a tail, Mr. Monopoly never had a monocle, and Pikachu never had a stripe on his tail. There are many more examples. Below is a list of 450.

[https://www.alternatememories.com/mandela-effect-list](https://www.alternatememories.com/mandela-effect-list)

The link below is a video created by scientists at CERN, and it seems to be mocking conspiracy theorists. Towards the end of the video, it shows one of the physicists wearing signs around his neck. One says “Bond 1” and the other says “Mandela”. The first actor to play James Bond was Barry Nelson. Nelson Mandela. Mandela Effect.

Some say CERN is not only changing the past, but shifting us into different timelines within the multiverse. Once again, this sounds crazy. However, CERN openly talks about working with D-Wave Systems, a quantum computing company that claims its machines work by “collaborating with parallel universes”. Below is a video of one of the founders giving a talk. Skip to 5:20 if you want to get right to the parallel universe stuff.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqN\_2jDVbOU&t=326s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqN_2jDVbOU&t=326s)

Is it possible our universe is becoming entangled with another? Are timelines overlapping? I feel like the video below may be evidence of that. In the video, a man finds a car that seems to be stuck between two worlds, the world with the Ford logo Mandela Effected people remember, and this world, with the Ford logo that’s always existed according to official records.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fHE0E9SpK8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fHE0E9SpK8)

Is an oddly named brand of cold medicine more evidence of entangled timelines? All my life I have never heard of 666 Cold Preparation, yet it’s been around for over 100 years. What I find most odd is if you look the stuff up online, many stores offer it, but not one of them ever seems to have it in stock. 666 Cold Preparation is a whole rabbit hole in itself. Supposedly a man named Dr. John Palmer created the medicine. He was the local physician and mortician of a small Florida town called Monticello. Its notorious for being the most haunted place in the state. Legend says Dr. Palmer’s sick practices are to blame.

I’ve also seen a lot of memes lately joking about God creating new animals. Some conspiracy theorists jokingly call these Mandanimals. What the hell is a sea pig or a scale worm? These things look like they’re literally from another dimension. They look Lovecraftian. I could just be uneducated, but c’mon.

[Look at these dudes.](https://preview.redd.it/r9t76i37kht41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7fafedc48447ea7756af8d194305b0dbfb9428af)

There is also a weird website dedicated to CERN that seems to be stuck in another time. The website shows music videos from Les Horribles Cernettes, an all woman pop group made up of CERN employees. A picture of the band was the first image ever uploaded to the internet. At least in this timeline. What’s strange though is the group formed in 1990. Les Horribles Cernettes is an obvious reference to the LHC, a machine at CERN that wasn’t operational until 2008. They also made a song in 1993 called Surfing on the Web. Were people using that kind of slang in the early 90s?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ox-tTPuZE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ox-tTPuZE8)

According to official history, CERN created the World Wide Web. Some say the real reason for it is to gather as much data about the world as possible. The data could be put into advanced computers to create simulations of the future. Once future events are predicted, scientists could act accordingly. Advanced simulations could also tell them what little changes in history would create drastic changes in the present. If CERN really is capable of time travel, they could theoretically send data to scientists in the past, telling them how to shape the future. Perhaps this is why right now we only notice subtle differences. So is CERN improving it’s technology in the past... from the future? This sounds confusing but this is what is known as retrocausality. Instead of a cause creating an effect, an effect creates a cause. This phenomenon is actually supported by quantum theory.

[https://phys.org/news/2017-07-physicists-retrocausal-quantum-theory-future.html](https://phys.org/news/2017-07-physicists-retrocausal-quantum-theory-future.html)

According to CERN’s official website, the first proton-proton collision happened in 1971. However, you can find contradicting articles and videos saying the first time it happened was in 2010. Did the scientists in 2010 send some data to the scientists in 1971? CERN's website also says a machine called the LEP existed many years before the LHC. However, if you search for images of the LEP, you get pictures of the LHC, which do look old, but as I’ve stated before, the LHC wasn’t operational until 2008. This picture of the ""LEP"" is literally the LHC seen from another angle.

[Notice the 1997 copyright? The LHC was still being built in 1998!](https://preview.redd.it/egcdplrhmht41.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d7a6ea56aea72b7e1a448cd81ffa97619a1dd42)

At present, there are over 30,000 particle accelerators around the world. When did these things start showing up? I feel like I haven’t heard about them until recently. Apparently they’ve been around since the 1930s. Are we experiencing what some call quantum infiltration? But why would CERN want to advance itself faster than time allows? And why do they want these machines everywhere? When certain particles collide with each other at extremely high speeds, they create antimatter. I think they are trying to bring as much antimatter into the world as they possibly can. Scientists at CERN believe when the universe was created it must have been made up of a perfectly even amount of normal matter and antimatter. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other. So this begs the question, why is there something instead of nothing?

&#x200B;

[The supersymmetry model.](https://preview.redd.it/3162ztusmht41.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6247845389f49574c61aabc9bf64a3ed5a9de644)

The official CERN website literally says some “unknown entity” must have intervened during the creation of the universe. Who would this “unknown entity” be? What kind of “entity” would rather us have more normal matter than antimatter? Why is this a problem?

[This quote is from an actual CERN scientist.](https://preview.redd.it/8etnd3pvmht41.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cb1f03972718faa919ddd3ef1fe4c416aaafd5ab)

According to a supposed CERN insider, being around antimatter too long can cause one to have nightmares, become aggressive, or even go crazy. UC Berkeley was one of the first places to store the substance, and ironically, it was also the site of one of the most violent protests of our time. The violence broke out primarily between alt-right and alt-left activists. Many of the alt-right activists were members of the Cult of Kek. The Cult of Kek ""worships"" the ancient Egyptian god of chaos. Interestingly enough, Japan has a particle collider named KEK. There is also a particle accelerator named PEP-II. Pepe is the name of the cult's mascot. Is the god of chaos manifesting himself through antimatter? This is also a whole rabbit hole in itself, but I just wanted to throw the idea out there.

Perhaps antimatter is what demonic entities are made up of? Considering the satanic symbolism we’ve seen so far, I don’t think this is too much of a stretch. Coincidentally, some Satanists believe they must balance the forces of good and evil to become whole. Sounds like CERN’s vision of the universe.

Like I said at the beginning of this thread, 2012 was the year CERN discovered the God Particle, but since then, they’ve found nothing. Since then, the Cernettes have disappeared, and weirdly enough, it’s the earliest you can find any articles written about their legendary photograph. This is also something I’ve written about before, but I often wonder if 2012 was the year our original world ended and CERN pushed us into a new one. Perhaps Stephen Hawking was right when he told us the particle could destroy the universe.

But the scientists at CERN seem desperate to prove their “mathematically perfect” model of the universe. One of them even admits their experiments could “dissolve what we think of as reality”. It seems they must always push the boundaries. There are even plans to build a much bigger collider. Whatever this monster of a machine will be capable of, who the hell knows. The scientists say they yearn for a new physics. What does that really mean? What would a world that no longer obeys the laws of nature look like?

A front page thread at nearly 100% upvoted is now sitting at 0 points and *44%* upvoted. This is an *extremely* low number for a thread that initially had many dozens of upvotes.

Now note the *users* with the top comments. I won't link them here for obvious reasons, but it should come as no surprise that they are as *inorganic* as they come.

In addition, they all claim to have been ""affected"" by these various diseases and tell their ""stories"" in a similar fashion.

The top voted comment is from an account that's 4 months old, with *negligible* history on reddit.

The 2nd highest comment is from a 2-year-old account, with only 3 pages of history on reddit. This was their first comment on /r/conspiracy. What a surprise!

Another user claiming to have had ""swine flu"" *twice* has a 5-month-old account, with less than a page of reddit history.

In addition, there are multiple ""new users"" in that thread with comments that have *not* been approved (new accounts have to wait 2 months before posting here). IOW, fresh accounts were activated and used to comment in the thread, even though the comments were removed by the automod.

What does this mean?

It means they are trying to game this forum. They know this is the last true skeptical holdout on this entire website, and I say that with all sincerity.

The staging of viral pandemics has the frightening ability to fool the brainwashed *and* the conspiracy researchers, if we aren't careful.

They will plant many seeds, but it's all predictive programming. To what end remains to be seen.

I've edited in direct links to the two versions of S.3178 ""The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act"" and quoted a section near the top because a sly poster linked the amended text, tried to mislead people, and deflect with a long wall of text.

Legal language in this anti-lynching bill has little actually to do with lynching. The text is written with focus on penalties for perceived ""hate crime"" with bodily injury to a person perpetrated by two or more persons on the basis of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

---

The timing of Smollett's fake hate crime attack, his relationship with Kamala Harris, and the stealth rider addition of LGBT protections into Harris and Booker's anti-lynching bill seems like it could be connected.

For Booker and Harris, they are vying to secure the support of LGBT groups for their 2020 Presidential run. If they convinced Smollett to fake an attack, it benefited them directly. 

Jessie Smollett a crisis actor?

There is obviously no shortage of modern day lynchings.

Years ago, a brilliant scientist named Peter Doshi eviscerated the flu hoax:

[Are US flu death figures more PR than science?](https://www.bmj.com/content/331/7529/1412)

>US data on influenza deaths are a mess. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges a difference between flu death and flu associated death yet uses the terms interchangeably. Additionally, there are significant statistical incompatibilities between official estimates and national vital statistics data. Compounding these problems is a marketing of fear—a CDC communications strategy in which medical experts “predict dire outcomes” during flu seasons.

>The CDC website states what has become commonly accepted and widely reported in the lay and scientific press: annually “about 36 000 [Americans] die from flu” (www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease.htm) and “influenza/pneumonia” is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm). But why are flu and pneumonia bundled together? Is the relationship so strong or unique to warrant characterising them as a single cause of death?

Here's the rub: They're *lying through their teeth* about ""the flu"".

The ""flu"" is their convenient excuse for the mass poisoning of the population with their lethal pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

Lockdowns didn't reduce ""flu"" cases...they're just calling ""flu"" cases ""COVID-19"".

This is the single stupidest and most obvious hoax in the history of mankind.

The 61-year-old leader has not been seen in public for more than two weeks. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said last week that Mr. Magufuli was ""healthy and working hard"". And [today](https://news.yahoo.com/tanzanias-president-john-magufuli-died-210554352.html) is reported that he died of a heart failure. 

To add some context, John Magufuli is one of the “Covid denier” heads of state from Africa.

He famously had his office submit five unlabelled samples for [testing](https://odysee.com/@TruthVault:0/Tanzanian-President-John-Magufuli---Papaya%2C-Goats-and-Cars-Oil-are-Corona-positive:a) – goat, motor oil, papaya, quail and jackfruit – and when four came back positive and one “inconclusive”, he banned the testing kits and called for an investigation into their origin and manufacture.

In the past, he has also questioned the safety and efficacy of the supposed “covid vaccines”, and has not permitted their use in Tanzania.

In the Western press Magufuli has been portrayed as “anti-science” and “populist”, but it is not fair to suggest that the health of the people of Tanzania is a low priority for the President. In fact it’s quite the opposite.

After winning his first election in 2015 he slashed government salaries (including his own) in order to increase funding for hospitals and buying AIDs medication. In 2015 he cancelled the Independence Day celebrations and used the money to launch an anti-Cholera campaign. Healthcare has been one of his administration’s top priorities, and Tanzanian life expectancy has increased every year while he has been in office.

The negative coverage of President Magufuli is a very recent phenomenon. Early in his Presidency he even received glowing write-ups from the Western press and Soros-backed think tanks, praising his reforms and calling him an “example” to other African nations.

All that changed when he spoke out about Covid being hoax.

When he was re-elected in October 2020 the standard Western accusations of “voter suppression” and “electoral fraud” appeared in the Western press which had previously reported his approval rating as high as 96%.

He is not the first African head of state to suffer such a fate in the age of Covid.

Last summer Pierre Nkurunziza, the President of Burundi, refused to play along with Covid and instructed the WHO delegation to leave his country…before dying suddenly of a “heart attack” or “suspected Covid19”. His successor immediately reversed every single one of his Covid policies, including inviting the WHO back to the country.

&#x200B;

Isn't it weird that these protests and riots seem to be corporately sponsored? How about the politicians, celebrities, and main stream media outlets that seem to be encouraging it.

And we bought
it. As did a LOT of people. But let's look at it for what it is, logically.

Donald Trump spoke, BEFORE all this crap, about passing laws to take down media he
did not like, did not agree with, and wanted to punish. NY Times.

Shortly after, we got Pizzagate. A divisive theory that got a LOT of people and
a sub banned from Reddit.

This pizza conspiracy continued to dominate the news during the election. Which only
served the GOP. And added fuel to the calls to 'lock her up.'

Fine. But it has continued after the election. And even expanded with MORE 'fake news.'

The goal this time is to silence dissent of all types. Meaning us, meaning any 'news source'
the government does not like.

Soon, the government will pass new laws that outlaw freedom of speech in the name of 'protecting' 
innocents  harmed by the Fake News THEY created and nurtured. Already happening in the UK.

Who gets to decide what is News and what is Fake News? The government, of course.

The flag burning debate? A prelude to altering the First Amendment. Not via the constitution, but
by stirring up anger and derision using 'Fake News' as the excuse.

Look at the  House Bill that passed a couple days ago. It allows the government to
decide which news sources are Russian Propaganda. At their discretion. How long until they
come for /r/conspiracy ?

This is a consolidation of power. And it is a major sign that something is afoot, that Donald
Trump is readying a takeover of media. And after that? Well, he has already telegraphed much of
his plan. It involves mass deportations, imprisonment for dissenters, rule by military force 
(the National Guard is already patrolling our border and could easily be used against 
so-called Sanctuary Cities) and on and on.

Once the inevitable protests erupt in Sanctuary Cities, Trump has all the reasons he needs to
declare Martial Law nationwide. Think I am joking? Just look, carefully, at his appointees.
He has loaded his administration with military lackeys who maintain total loyalty to HIM. Not
to the Constitution, but loyalty to Donald Trump.

Fake News (pizza gate) is a pretext to wipe out /r/conspiracy and other news and forum sites
across the social web. Trump will target anyone who opposes him or espouses Truth To Power.

We cannot let this happen. This is our First Amendment under attack in a calculated and broad
assassination attempt during daylight. We must find a way to fight this.

People have taken the bait, planted by Trump, Clinton, or the Russians. Who did it doesn't much matter.
Now it is a pretext to shut us all down, to censor us, in the name of protecting innocent people 
like 'pizza parlor owners.' WE are the innocents and THEY built this to distract us and 
tear us apart. And we were not even looking.

What now? I don't have the slightest clue. It may be too late.

First off, it is in a near perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe.  Whereas the other planets have tiny moons orbiting them (relative to the size of the planet), our is MASSIVE in relative size.  It is more than a quarter the size of earth. http://www.jgiesen.de/moons/index.htm  This is **gigantic** in so far as moons go.  Our moon is the perfect size and the perfect distance from the earth to cause a perfect eclipse.


The moon never rotates from our perspective.  In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun.  It’s almost as if someone planned it that way.  Hmmm….


There are many scientific evidence that suggests the moon maybe hollow.  This is not wild speculation or a conspiracy theory.  The moon is lighter than it should be. The moon's mean density is 3.34 gm/cm3 (3.34 times an equal volume of water) whereas the Earth's is 5.5.  Experiments have shown that the moon reverberates like a hollow sphere when struck. https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/nasas-unexplained-files/videos/why-does-the-moon-sound-hollow   Hell, even PhD’s are claiming that it could be made of metal and could be hollow. http://www.woowoomedia.com/phd-says-the-moon-is-older-than-earth-and-is-made-of-metal/


Now if all this weirdness hasn’t convinced you that the moon is not what you think it is, I don’t know what will.  So, then what is it?  Could it be an observation deck?  Could it have been placed there on purpose to secretly observe how life developed and evolved on earth?  Could our planet be just a one big biological experiment?  Could the aliens have planted the seeds of life on earth and setup an observatory deck to see how it develops?


Let’s just ditch the idea that the moon landing was a hoax.  I know some people are passionate about this, but for the sake of this article, let’s just ignore that theory.  So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972, why are scientists now saying “we don’t have the technology to go to the moon.  We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.”  Huh?  Say what?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MMZJlp_0Y

Just WTF?  How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore?  

Why is there suddenly a layer of deadly radiation called the Van Allen Belts that would kill any astronauts leaving the earth’s orbit today, but didn’t kill them in the 60’s? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBBUwdyz4I 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt



The answer lies in the fact that there are countless evidence that the entire moon landings from start to finish were carefully observed by alien entities.   We have photos of objects floating above the astronauts as they walked on the moon. https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/610270/Final-proof-THREE-separate-UFOs-seen-watching-moon-landings-in-new-Nasa-photos  Heck, even good ol’ Buzz Aldrin admitted seeing something while on the moon. http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/  We even have videos of astronauts trying to contain their shock as they notice strange objects above them while they were on the moon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw  


So what does all this mean?  Yup.  Gonna say it. **The moon landings were accomplished with the assistance of aliens**  Call me crazy because even I think it is.  But this is the only explanation my tiny mind can come up with to answer all of the mysteries listed above. 


Why would they do this?  Well, I’d imagine that too many questions were being asked about the moon.  If people started noticing that the moon is a big ole spaceship, the aliens would have a problem with the ongoing secret observation of our development on earth.  So they assisted NASA in getting to the moon so they can walk around the surface like children and report back to the ignorant earthlings “Yup, the moon is just a rock”.  LOL.  


But things are a changing.  Our technology is advancing rapidly.  They’re not gonna be able to keep it a secret much longer.  We will reveal the truth about the moon very very soon. (I hope)

* Gardasil is said to protect against cervical cancer, a disease that in the U.S., has a relatively low mortality rate of 1 in 43,478 (2.3 per 100,000) 
* In “The  Plaintiff’s Science Day Presentation on Gardasil,” Robert F. Kennedy,  Jr. reveals Merck data showing Gardasil increases the overall risk of death by 370%, risk of autoimmune disease by 2.3% and risk of a serious medical condition by 50%  
* Postmarketing and adverse events reported during use of the vaccine post-licensing are listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert and include blood and lymphatic system disorders, pulmonary embolus, pancreatitis, autoimmune diseases, anaphylactic reactions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders and more 
* Merck’s use of a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a proper placebo in its safety trials effectively renders its safety testing null and void, as the true  extent of harm cannot be accurately ascertained 

 

The HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted European license in February 2006,1 followed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval that same year in June.2  Gardasil was controversial in the U.S. from the beginning, with vaccine  safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to  fast track the vaccine to licensure.3

Lauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer, there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that [Gardasil vaccine](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/05/05/hpv-vaccine-gardasil.aspx)  has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls (and young boys) in the  U.S. and in countries across the world. Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4

 

* Anaphylaxis
* Guillain-Barre Syndrome
* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)
* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)
* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)
* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)
* Sudden death

 

Postmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.

According to ""Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,"" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.

Despite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.

The Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.

The information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.

However, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, ""because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander"" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.

Kennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.

Instead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.

 

## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing 

Kennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.

In his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.

A third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.

Next, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the ""Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.""  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.

Now all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. ""They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,"" Kennedy says.

Looking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.

In reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.

Merck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.

As noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, ""The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.""

## Risk evaluation

When making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.

If 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?

And how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.

## Protocol 18

Merck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.

Protocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — ""a very, very tiny group of  people,"" Kennedy says, ""for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.""

Aside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  ""fraud and flimflam,"" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.

Instead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the ""placebo"" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).

Very little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control ""fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,"" Kennedy says.

None of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.

>*""They tested a completely different formulation,""* he says*.  ""And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  
>  
>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.""*  
 

## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks

Kennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.

For example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

Yet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with ""any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.""

Merck also used ""sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,"" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.

Also ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.

The researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.

Many of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  ""new medical conditions"" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.

According to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had ""new medical  history"" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.

## Risk evaluation, take 2

**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**

## More lies 

According to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.

>*""Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,""* Kennedy says.  
>  
>*""Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   
>  
>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.""*

 

But it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients ""include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,"" Kennedy says.

He goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)

What this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:

&#x200B;

* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV 
* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease
* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition
* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer

## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections 

""To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,"" Kennedy says. ""Type  replacement"" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. 

The study,14  ""Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,"" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:

>*""… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   
>  
>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   
>  
>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   
>  
>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.""*

It's f***ing creepy.

We also have the problem of Kreepy Kamala's secret occult police force that the media seems to be completely blind to and her connections to the Jussie Smollett racism hoax that proves all of these racist media narratives are staged from the bottom to the top.

Nobody is talking about transparency of government, which is the one solution to all of these problems.

The election was stolen.

Disagree with me? Then why is only your opinion allowed to be told by Big Tech? Why are massive astroturfing firms silencing conversations about the stolen election on the Internet?

Why has the Internet and media completely suppressed and eliminated Dominion Voting conflicts of interest? Or their mapped out social media, proving it?

Why has the Internet and media suppressed and eliminated Hunter Biden' laptop, despite there being wire transfer data between the Bidens and Chinese Intelligence?

Pedophiles. Money launderers. Secret Police. Stolen elections.

Has everyone forgotten the stolen primaries?

Anyone speaking up for these people are part of huge astroturfing campaigns. If you compare Trump's social media numbers and Biden's, it is very, very clear Trump is far, far more popular. It isn't even a contest, as Biden's numbers are minuscule in comparison.

Why are there multiple documents like this?

Astroturfers will come in and complain about Trump supporters but they fail to understand that people weren't supporting Trump as much as they were supporting the idea that pedophiles might finally start getting arrested.

Arrest. Prosecute. Execute.

That is the appropriate solution for child sex traffickers.

That is the appropriate solution for Ghislaine Maxwell. 

That is the appropriate solution for Keith Rainier (who bundled votes for Hillary, btw).

Pedophile rings exist at the benevolence of corrupt politicians, priests and corporations.

Striking at the heart of pedophile rings is to strike at the heart of corruption. 

You shills can complain about Trump and racism and politics all you want, but we all know it is a distraction so to protect the child sex traffickers and that is why you all belong in jail, too.

The shills who work with Reddit admin to politically astroturf and suppress legitimate evidence are participating in a massive game to run forensic interruption operations so that human traffickers can continue their trade unimpeded. The closer we get to prosecuting them, the more they will take away our rights.

The Great Conspiracy is not that hard to understand. It is about gradually asserting authoritarianism until the corporate totalitarian state can keep every drop of proceeds for your labor and decide how you spend every dollar and your identity can only be from a predetermined set of corporate slave identities that will all have their own shade of mental illness so that big pharma can continue to engineer your bodies and minds.

More than corruption is happening. Your agency is being stolen and the UniParty MultiCult is laughing in your face. They are sending shills to laugh in your face. Hunter Biden had a Reddit account and the first thing he did was go shill against Pizzagate. They are straight up coming here and laughing in your face because they still get to f*** little kids and God knows what else.

Shout out to http://www.endthebacklog.org/. If you are, at all, interested in justice, and you want to actually do something. Call your leaders in your local jurisdictions to inquire about and apply pressure to get back logged sexual assault examination kits tested.

Every time they do a huge chunk, multiple serial rapists are caught. Detroit had huge success.

End the kit backlog is another way to target a lot of corruption with the smallest amount of effort. Everyone who stands against the testing of rape examination kits is a problem.

Kamala Harris and her secret police WANT SERIAL RAPISTS ON YOUR STREETS. San Diego has been harboring an atrocious backlog despite money being available. 

Retard excuses are presented like, ""they don't have investigative value."" So what. We all agreed and paid to test the damn kits. Don't give us any more excuses.

Trump is irrelevant. The issue of racism is irrelevant. If you want to fix society, you will target corrupt politicians.

If corruption is addressed through transparency and accountability, our society will enter a Golden Age. It is literally the last hurdle. Anyone telling you to fight each other instead of fight child sex traffickers is 1) a psychopath 2) a terrible person 3) deserves to be named and shamed.

THAT is what over reaching spy powers be for. Corrupt politicians and child sex traffickers. Our spy apparatus is not catching anyone except political opponents. Anyone who supports the current administration is complicit in aiding a corporate totalitarian state (at one of their critical turning points in their ability to manipulate stupid people) and everyone should be made aware.

And, ultimately, even if you, as an individual don't have much of a political will, at least be kind to each other. Abuse only creates more abusers and that is really the heart of society's problems.

52,Exclusive: FBI document warns conspiracy theories are a new domestic terrorism threat,575.0,ckqppi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ckqppi/exclusive_fbi_document_warns_conspiracy_theories/,311.0,1564677210.0,"https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html

----------------------------------

The FBI for the first time has identified fringe conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat, according to a previously unpublicized document obtained by Yahoo News. (Read the document below.)

The FBI intelligence bulletin from the bureau’s Phoenix field office, dated May 30, 2019, describes “conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists,” as a growing threat, and notes that it is the first such report to do so. It lists a number of arrests, including some that haven’t been publicized, related to violent incidents motivated by fringe beliefs.

The document specifically mentions QAnon, a shadowy network that believes in a deep state conspiracy against President Trump, and Pizzagate, the theory that a pedophile ring including Clinton associates was being run out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant (which didn’t actually have a basement).

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document states. It also goes on to say the FBI believes conspiracy theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential election cycle.

The FBI said another factor driving the intensity of this threat is “the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups involving illegal, harmful, or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures.” The FBI does not specify which political leaders or which cover-ups it was referring to.

President Trump is mentioned by name briefly in the latest FBI document, which notes that the origins of QAnon is the conspiratorial belief that “Q,” allegedly a government official, “posts classified information online to reveal a covert effort, led by President Trump, to dismantle a conspiracy involving ‘deep state’ actors and global elites allegedly engaged in an international child sex trafficking ring.”

This recent intelligence bulletin comes as the FBI is facing pressure to explain who it considers an extremist, and how the government prosecutes domestic terrorists. In recent weeks the FBI director has addressed domestic terrorism multiple times but did not publicly mention this new conspiracy theorist threat.

The FBI is already under fire for its approach to domestic extremism. In a contentious hearing last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray faced criticism from Democrats who said the bureau was not focusing enough on white supremacist violence. “The term ‘white supremacist,’ ‘white nationalist’ is not included in your statement to the committee when you talk about threats to America,” Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said. “There is a reference to racism, which I think probably was meant to include that, but nothing more specific.”

Wray told lawmakers the FBI had done away with separate categories for black identity extremists and white supremacists, and said the bureau was instead now focusing on “racially motivated” violence. But he added, “I will say that a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.”

The FBI had faced mounting criticism for the term “black identity extremists,” after its use was revealed by Foreign Policy magazine in 2017. Critics pointed out that the term was an FBI invention based solely on race, since no group or even any specific individuals actually identify as black identity extremists.

In May, Michael C. McGarrity, the FBI’s assistant director of the counterterrorism division, told Congress the bureau now “classifies domestic terrorism threats into four main categories: racially motivated violent extremism, anti-government/anti-authority extremism, animal rights/environmental extremism, and abortion extremism,” a term the bureau uses to classify both pro-choice and anti-abortion extremists.

The new focus on conspiracy theorists appears to fall under the broader category of anti-government extremism. “This is the first FBI product examining the threat from conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists and provides a baseline for future intelligence products,” the document states.

The new category is different in that it focuses not on racial motivations, but on violence based specifically on beliefs that, in the words of the FBI document, “attempt to explain events or circumstances as the result of a group of actors working in secret to benefit themselves at the expense of others” and are “usually at odds with official or prevailing explanations of events.”

The FBI acknowledges conspiracy theory-driven violence is not new, but says it’s gotten worse with advances in technology combined with an increasingly partisan political landscape in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. “The advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access,” the document says.

The bulletin says it is intended to provide guidance and “inform discussions within law enforcement as they relate to potentially harmful conspiracy theories and domestic extremism.”

The FBI Phoenix field office referred Yahoo News to the bureau’s national press office, which provided a written statement.

“While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve,” the FBI said.

In its statement, the FBI also said it can “never initiate an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity. As with all of our investigations, the FBI can never monitor a website or a social media platform without probable cause.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which has also been involved in monitoring domestic extremism, did not return or acknowledge emails and phone requests for comment.

While not all conspiracy theories are deadly, those identified in the FBI’s 15-page report led to either attempted or successfully carried-out violent attacks. For example, the Pizzagate conspiracy led a 28-year-old man to invade a Washington, D.C., restaurant to rescue the children he believed were being kept there, and fire an assault-style weapon inside.

The FBI document also cites an unnamed California man who was arrested on Dec. 19, 2018, after being found with what appeared to be bomb-making materials in his car. The man allegedly was planning “blow up a satanic temple monument” in the Capitol rotunda in Springfield, Ill., to “make Americans aware of Pizzagate and the New World Order, who were dismantling society,” the document says.

Historian David Garrow, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Martin Luther King Jr. who has worked extensively with FBI archives, raised doubts to Yahoo News about the memo. He says the FBI’s default assumption is that violence is motivated by ideological beliefs rather than mental illness. “The guy who shot up the pizza place in D.C.: Do we think of him as a right-wing activist, or insane?” Garrow asked.

Garrow was similarly critical of the FBI’s use of the term “black identity extremists” and related attempts to ascribe incidents like the 2016 shooting of six police officers in Baton Rouge, La., to black radicalism. He said the shooter, Gavin Long, had a history of mental health problems. “The bureau’s presumption — the mindset — is to see ideological motives where most of the rest of us see individual nuttiness,” he said.

Identifying conspiracy theories as a threat could be a political lightning rod, since President Trump has been accused of promulgating some of them, with his frequent references to a deep state and his praise in 2015 for Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy site InfoWars. While the FBI intelligence bulletin does not mention Jones or InfoWars by name, it does mention some of the conspiracy theories frequently associated with the far-right radio host, in particular the concept of the New World Order.

Jones claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which 26 children were killed, was a hoax, a false flag operation intended as a pretext for the government to seize or outlaw firearms. The families of a number of victims have sued Jones for defamation, saying his conspiracy-mongering contributed to death threats and online abuse they have received.

While Trump has never endorsed Sandy Hook denialism, he was almost up until the 2016 election the most high-profile promoter of the birther conspiracy that claimed former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. He later dropped his claim, and deflected criticism by pointing the finger at Hillary Clinton. He said her campaign had given birth to the conspiracy, and Trump “finished it.”

There is no evidence that Clinton started the birther conspiracy.

Epstein's victims spoke about Ivanka Trump working with Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein, Trump was good friends with Epstein and has always been good friends with Bill and Hilary. 

If he was on our side he would call a press conference and expose Fauci for his spending on Corona and his history as a medical conman, he would expose the whole thing. Instead, he's a pawn used to lay the foundations for the eventual civil war Bill Cooper predicted. Since JFK the powers that be would never ever let a threat to their power be the president of the united states. His role is purely to sow division and alienate half of the country like Obama did.

Nothing has changed positively under him, he has just verbally opposed our enemies with no substance or end result. 

They have used him to create a period of time where the elite can get away with anything and the general public will look back and think 'the Trump administration were awful they did this and that etc.' when it was them. Stop falling for this 'administration' nonsense, there's a permanent government that these presidents serve without question.

If there was any doubt before, The Guardian has fully cemented itself as a propaganda rag with this unconscionable drivel, aka the perfect fodder for the front page of /r/all.

/r/news is lapping it up of course...I defy you to read through that comment section and not come away with a grave concern for humanity. 

These folks have been swallowed by hatred, fear and cognitive dissonance. It's depressing and terrifying.

What we're seeing is the culmination of decades of propaganda meant to create an unquestioning slave class through medical tyranny.

What we're seeing is the Endless War Machine slowly relinquishing its position as the great evil to the Pharmaceutical Mafia, which is now the means to which these criminals can get their quota of sacrificial lambs.

FTR, I never was *remotely* interested in the subject of vaccines when I began my personal journey down the rabbit hole.

It was only when I saw the ignorance and vitriol emanating from the narrative swallowers regarding the subject of vaccine that it started to pique my interest.

Whenever someone tells you ""the science is settled"" and not to do your own research, that's when you know you've found something vital that requires further investigation.

It couldn't be more clear that unquestioning obedience to our vaccine overlords is a key ingredient in the implementation of the New World Order. It's why these corrupt interests have attempted to stifle any discourse on this subject, and why it can elicit such an emotional and visceral response from individuals who are still asleep.

In the early days of reddit, the shilling for the MIC, big pharma, and companies like Monsanto was rampant. I remember realizing that certain topics would bring them out of the woodwork like rats, and they would harass and attack folks like me with impunity.

It became clear that I could discover which were the ""controversial/taboo"" topics and truths by how much push back I would receive for even discussing them.

I remember that questioning Monsanto was a BIG one. There was a massive propaganda effort deployed on reddit (and the internet in general) to attack and malign everyone who dared question the ""noble"" intentions of the abjectly corrupt company.

However, NO TOPIC came CLOSE to inciting abuse and harassment than questioning the vaccine paradigm.

When I realized that THIS was THE topic of concern, it became clear the vaccine/virus/pandemic issue was at the heart of the deception and war against the people being waged by these anti-human criminals.

As a result, I've made it my personal mission to sound the alarm about what they are currently attempting to implement. Not that several of these threads are 6 or 7 years old, which speaks to their persistence and the sheer amount of preparation leading to this planned pandemic:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ncovshills/comments/evpdzo/chinese_shills_the_50_cent_party/

I was told by some people from this sub to post any interesting discoveries.

&nbsp;

Credit to u/5nordehacedod for finding this. **Now to start the conspiracy:**

5 out of the 8 authors work at the Wuhan Institute for Virlogy, which is only 8 miles from the wet market. There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists: The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Here are some bits from the study:


“Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotyping

“Viral pseudotyping can also be very useful for studying emerging and highly pathogenic viruses. These viruses are often difficult for researchers to study because of the danger they pose. Pseudotypes can be made where the HIV envelope glycoprotein or the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein are replaced with the envelope from a highly pathogenic virus. These pseudotypes allow scientists to characterize the cellular tropism and entry determinants of otherwise challenging to study viruses”

This is important because yesterday a study was published suggesting that nCoV has bizarre HIV gene segments:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1

Here is the conclusion:

“Our analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date. To our surprise, all the 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV mapped to short segments of amino acids in the HIV-1 gp120 and Gag among all annotated virus proteins in the NCBI database. This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is **unlikely to be fortuitous**. Further, 3D modelling suggests that atleast 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site. Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation. Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.”

Fortuitous def:

“Happening by accident or chance rather than design.”

This study has since been withdrawn since it has not been peer review, but the HIV proteins they are talking about are the ones the Chinese scientists were working on.

&nbsp;

You may have also noticed the mention of ACE2 molecules. A study was published that Asian males are genetically much more vulnerable to nCoV due to their presence:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full

Here are the important parts:

""We further compared the characteristics of the donors and their ACE2 expressing patterns. No association was detected between the ACE2-expressing cell number and the age or smoking status of donors.
“Of note, the 2 male donors have a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than all other 6 female donors (1.66% vs. 0.41% of all cells, P value=0.07, Mann Whitney Test). In addition, the distribution of ACE2 is also more widespread in male donors than females: at least 5 different types of cells in male lung express this receptor, while only 2~4 types of cells in female lung express the receptor.”

“This result is highly consistent with the epidemic investigation showing that most of the confirmed 2019-nCov infected patients were men (30 vs. 11, by Jan 2, 2020).""

""We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.""

""The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.”

Look at those numbers.

&nbsp;

I have not deep dived the info and data in the original study, but I think it is worth a look and our posting and discussing it may have been what caused our mysterious quarantine. Don't let them memory hole this. Save and screenshot.

&nbsp;

A virus like this escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat (like bat soup), and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice in 2004!

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/sars-escaped-beijing-lab-twice-50137

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

As for why it hurts Asian males more? There could be a few reasons. Perhaps they were working on a race targeted weapon, and they only had Asian subjects to work on. Perhaps they were testing out ways to defend against such a race targeted virus from the U.S.

&nbsp;

EDIT:

As for reasons to deliberately release a virus that targets specifically Asian men? 

This could be one. In China, males outnumber females by 34 million people due to sex targeted abortions.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/too-many-men/

Many studies have shown that polygamy breeds civil war. Millions of angry single men who can't get a family or girlfriend.

https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/03/19/why-polygamy-breeds-civil-war

The PLA only has a ground force of 975,000 personnel.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army

They would be greatly outnumbered, and groups like the CIA would love to funnel in guns, IEDS, ATGMs, MANPADS, etc. Many other Chinese will join in due to the horrible crimes and extreme repression of the CCP regime. It would be the ugliest civil war in history.

The virus also does increased damage to the elderly.

China has a problem with too many old people. “It’s the No. 1 economic problem for China going forward,” says Stuart Leckie, chairman of Stirling Finance Ltd., a Hong Kong–based pension-fund consulting firm that has advised the Chinese government."" By 2050, 330 million Chinese will be over age 65, which is a huge issue because China is entering negative population growth.

https://time.com/5523805/china-aging-population-working-age/

Two birds with one stone. Kill a few million people, but not too many to truly cripple China in the long run. Remember, China killed 45 million people in 4 years, such a scheme is not beyond them.

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html

This virus also gives them cover to purge dissidents. With martial law declared and so many people dying, you could kill a shit ton of people without much notice. Maybe they move into Hong Kong to help manage the sick and enforce quarantine. It gives you a good excuse to tighten the grip on your country.

Re-uploaded for those who can't access scribd or want to download a copy: https://www.mediafire.com/?cx6pqjz1do1uxcg

The PDF appears to be a high-definition scan of a paper document. It's professionally edited and typeset, definitely above the quality of a typical hoax or manufactured leak. The tactics described therein are similar to those known to be used by CTR, but grander in proposed scope, and there are many new directions taken. For these reasons, I'm inclined to believe the document is genuine.

Main points:

Media Matters and its affiliate Shareblue plan to become the reference point for liberal news media, especially online

In particular, they plan to provide their own ""research"" to friendly media outlets to push liberal narratives

At the same time, they will try to censor non-aligned outlets, including by having Facebook, Google and Twitter penalize them

They will also heavily push the ""fake news"" and ""Russian propaganda"" angles to discredit non-aligned outlets

They intend to deploy social media analytics to catch developing stories as they emerge and direct their shill armies, called ""truth squads"" (not even kidding), to shape the narrative; this will be done via their proprietary tools and communications network, so it will appear to the outside world as if a genuine grassroots movement is happening

We cant lose this pressure and momentum. We need direction and leadership to steer this societal shift.. Not marching aimlessly. It needs steered to a constructive end.. Its just gonna grow and grow. Not gonna end anytime soon. We need to start making demands on the government for change.

Why are we calling this a 'potential alien body'? Because that's exactly what it could be...

So far, DNA testing has shown us a species unlike anything found in the fossil record.

Back in June of 2017 an [announcement was made publicly](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_139.htm) about a new mummy that was unearthed [in Nazca Peru](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lineas_nazca.htm) that began showing incredible signs of being a species we have not yet found.

Now, new bodies have been revealed and they are proving to be highly interesting as well.

>**""Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered... We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time...**

**I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.""Dr. Edgar Mitchell6th man to walk on the moon(**[**source**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_apollomissions02.htm#Video_and_Entire_Video_Transcript_of)**) (**[**source**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousuniverse156.htm)**) (**[**source)**](https://vimeo.com/124604396)

There are hundreds of 'high-ranking' people, like **Edgar** **Mitchell**, who have argued this.

On top of that, we've had the official declassification of hundreds of thousands of government documents, via the *Freedom of Information Act*, showing decades of military encounters with unidentified flying objects, travelling at speeds and performing maneuvers no known aircraft can.

And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this topic. If you haven't already heard, [Gaia.com recently released information and footage](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_139.htm) regarding the discovery of multiple mummified bodies.

They are humanoid, and have three fingers and three toes on each hand, with a distinctly different shape of skull compared to modern day humans, as well as those who roamed the Earth before we did.

Multiple scientists have been involved with this project up to this point, as you will see in the video below.

One of them is Dr. **Konstantin Korotkov**, a professor of Computer Science and Biophysics at Saint-Petersburg Federal University of Informational Technologies, Mechanics and Optics.

He [said](https://www.gaia.com/video/update-6-bodies-evidence?fullplayer=feature&),

>""we have a very important mission here in Peru. I came here because of this group of scientists, professionals, \[and\] journalists.""

When they brought out the body and,

>**""pulled it out of the box, it was a stunned silence at first.""**

&#x200B;

Author **Graham Hancock** describes his experience in one of his books, [*Fingerprints of the Gods*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/egipto/fingerprintgods/fingerprintgods.htm)*:*

>Below us now there's a pair of parallel lines, almost two miles long, arrow straight all the way to vanishing point.

And there, off to the right, a series of abstract shapes on a scale so vast – and yet so precisely executed – that it seems inconceivable they could have been the work of men.

The people around here say that they were not the work of men, but of demigods, [the Viracochas](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/egipto/fingerprintgods/fingerprintgods01.htm), who also left their fingerprints elsewhere in the Andean region many thousands of years ago.

So far it seems [that](https://www.gaia.com/video/update-6-bodies-evidence?fullplayer=feature&),

>**""initial examinations suggest the possibility of a species unlike anything found in the fossil record.""**

Early DNA results of the mummy, named ""Maria,"" show that she is female, and that the other bodies found alongside her, which look to be a spouse and a couple of children, are also real, biological bodies.

Some of their organs are actually still intact. Further testing was done on one of the strangest aspects of these bodies, their fingers and toes, and has shown that these parts are not fake, ruling out any possibility of a hoax.

They're the same material, the same chemical composition, and the same DNA. The samples taken from Maria's fingers matched the date of her body, which is approximately 249-411 AD.

Carbon dating, and an analysis of the structure of the body via CT scan and X-ray, proved it was real.

https://preview.redd.it/tfebmcukdfw41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0211c1864b784ee25da9d399761221cb2d7c4c7d

>**""From the first DNA analysis, it was proven it's not chimpanzee, it's not monkey, but it's human-like DNA.**

**It was proven. Because we know that now we have three types of human like creatures. It is Neanderthals, Cro-Magnon like ourselves, and Denisovan.**

**Now, at next level, they have to make much more detailed analysis, and much more complicated analysis, so they will create a library of genes, and then they will be able to compare it with database of human subjects.**

**Then, we'll see whether it is exactly human like, or it is little bit different.""**[**Dr. Konstantin Korotkov**](https://www.gaia.com/video/update-6-bodies-evidence?fullplayer=feature&)

The team is currently still currently waiting for a more detailed DNA analysis, which can take some time. What's interesting about the mummy is that all the internal organs have remained intact.

The heart, stomach, and parts of the brain are available for examination.

>**""It is clear that she has the same type of internal organs as we do.""** 

**When it comes to the** [CT scans](https://www.gaia.com/video/update-6-bodies-evidence?fullplayer=feature&):

>**""We are scientifically proving that this body is a real body, that was once alive.**

**For example, here we have the teeth from the upper arch, and here are the ones from the lower arch. The skull with the remains of brain mass, this part here shows the lungs at the side.**

**This is the heart, with the bronchus, and the great vessels, lungs at both sides. This is still the heart, and here are the four cavities, and the bronchi that are preserved.""**

They also show the intestines and abdomen, and that the placement of the internal organs is ""completely harmonious.""

## New Bodies - The Family

In [this video](https://www.gaia.com/video/update-6-bodies-evidence?fullplayer=feature&), investigative journalist **Jaime Maussan** reveals that more bodies have since been discovered:

>two adults and one youth.**""They are very very similar.""**

Currently, they are testing the other bodies, and if they prove to be real like the other bodies, that will total six real bodies, whoever or whatever they are. The perseveration is amazing.

In the video, they show a scan of one of the little mummies, whose bone density reveals the makeup of an actual living being.

>**""We can scientifically prove that the skull of these creatures have a cranial cavity similar to humans. But they have some strong differences.""**

The team has since worked with animators to simulate how these creatures would have gotten around, as shown in the video below.

## ""Human-Like DNA"" - What Does That Even Mean?

What does human-like DNA really mean?

After all, humans share 50% of their DNA with a banana, approximately 80% with dogs, and 99% with chimpanzees. In reality, our genomes differ in many ways, but the numbers seem to imply something else.

The point I am trying to make is, with regards to my research into the extraterrestrial phenomenon, the common factor is humanoid.

With all of this information most likely locked up in [Black Budget](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blackbudget.htm) *Special Access Programs* ([SAPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program)),

>Who knows what type of science and discoveries remain classified?

What if the common denominator, when it comes to extraterrestrials, is a DNA match that is extremely close?

What would that say about life in general?

I don't believe ""human DNA"" is limited to our planet alone.

English scientist **Francis Crick**, most noted for co-discovering the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 alongside **James D. Watson**, wrote in his book [*Life Itself*](https://www.amazon.ca/Life-Itself-Francis-Crick/dp/0671255630) that there is no possible way that the DNA molecule could have gotten its start here on Earth and that it had to have come here from *somewhere else*...

He theorizes in ""[Direct Panspermia](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/directed-panspermia.pdf)"":

>It now seems unlikely that extraterrestrial living organisms could have reached the earth either as spores driven by the radiation pressure from another star or as living organisms imbedded in a meteorite.

As an alternative to these nineteenth-century mechanisms, we have considered Directed Panspermia, the theory that organisms were deliberately transmitted to the earth by intelligent beings on another planet.

We conclude that it is possible that life reached the earth in this way, but that the scientific evidence is inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability.

We draw attention to the kinds of evidence that might throw additional light on the topic.

He is one of many researchers in the field who believes this.

50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair **1** celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. Here are some of them posing for a photo. **2**

My research into the Embassy Art shipments began when the Howard Gutman Belgian embassy pedophilia scandal appeared on Voat, and somehow no one in the state department did anything to stop Gutman from doing his job.

( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10114694/US-state-department-accused-of-covering-up-prostitution-investigation.html )

An ambassador, believed to be Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman, who ""routinely ditched ... his protective security detail,"" and inspectors suspect this was in order to ""solicit sexual favors from prostitutes,"" some of whom were underage. The investigation into Gutman was called off after his meeting with Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy.

**Beth Dozoretz**

Today, Art in Embassies in run by Beth Dozoretz, a close friend of Hillary Clinton and famous for helping Bill Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his final day in office. **1** To quote Vanity Fair, Dozoretz became drew attention to herself when ""she played a key role in persuading her friend Bill Clinton to pardon her fugitive billionaire ex-husband, Marc Rich”. As is the case with most Hillary Clinton confidantes, the more effort they put into covering up international crime and trafficking, the higher they climbed. And even though Hillary’s state department did little to oversee embassies during her tenure as SoS, she still invested a ton of time and effort into promoting Art in Embassies.

**1** ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106 )

Dozoretz has worked with Alefantis before and they are closely linked among the D.C. elite. This shows that Alefantis, at the very least, is closely tied to the center of globalist power in America, and with the podesta brothers & company.

**Skull & Bones, kings of opium and smuggling**

The Art in Embassies program is run by many members/alumni of the Yale circle of elites, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Robert Storr (Dean of Yale School of Art) and many other industrialist families behind some of America’s best-known brands. The Sackler's, the family behind Purdue Pharma (Valium and Oxycontin), clearly took time away from their role as drug-pushers to promote the arts with the global elite. Here they are with their esteemed lapdog Alec Baldwin.

( http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg )

This is an important detail I can’t stress enough. They literally controlled the Opium market with a prescription drug, exactly as the United States did in Afghanistan, all the way back to the era of the Opium Wars in China…which Skull and Bones controlled. Remember, these families are primarily located around connecticut.

The Sacklers, who have coordinated events with James Alefantis, **1** presented medals to Marina Abramovic and Jeff Koons, whose former wife stated that Koons made his Child touch his private area **2** both of whose work have been transported on these aircraft multiple times, some directly through the Tony and Heather Podesta collection. In fact, Podesta “gifted” transported some of Abramovic’s ""bloody"" work to Whitechapel, London, **3** supported in part by the ""UK Friends of the National Museum of Women Artists"". Notice how they conceal their organizations--diplomatic groups functioning within art galleries.

**3** ( http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/terrains-of-the-body-photography-from-the-national-museum-of-women-in-the-arts/ )

The event shows that it’s not simply celebrating art, but actually announcing the sending of the paintings.

>The event marks the beginning of a landmark collaboration between the Sackler and Art in Embassies. In coming years, **the Sackler will host exhibitions of works by contemporary Asian and Asian American artists before their installation by Arts in Embassies at new U.S. embassies overseas.**

Here’s where it gets weirder. Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event. **1** Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes.

Please Note Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

**Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass**

One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.

( https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php )

( http://www.multimodalintl.com/ )

The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.

>This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain **endangered species or animal products**), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others. **We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.**

While their corporate headquarters are in Manhattan, Masterpiece International has other 'public' locations which are interesting, including West Palm Beach and Miami Beach; places famous for all kinds of ""cargo"" so bypassing security is very convenient for them. 

The founder of this shipping outfit is David B. Epstein (his genealogy is scrubbed as it that of Jeffrey Epstein, so I couldn't see if they might be actually related. Not much about David on the web, but there's this in the public domain. 

( https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx )

When I noticed that Masterpiece International has a business relationship with the largest shipping container firm in the world which is 49% owned by the govt of Israel, then it got interesting. You can see ZIM on this rate increase PDF from Masterpiece Intl:

About ZIM 

( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_Integrated_Shipping_Services )

ZIM is global, even has a port in Turkey

( http://www.zim.com/countrysites/asia/turkey/en-us/pages/aboutzim.aspx )

Information that ZIM moved radioactive remains of WTC and sold this ""steel"" to China had been completely scrubbed, but most people have heard of them because they broke their lease to get out of the WTC before 9/11, losing $50K in the process, which is maredly interesting.

>The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moved their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks (VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001). More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten were still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escaped unharmed. (JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001) 

There's a lot on that topic, but here's a link with documentation

( http://historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zim-american_israeli_shipping_co. )

>When ZIM moved out of WTC, an Israeli moving company occupied their floors but escaped unharmed on the big day as well. [How many Muslim owned companies moved out of the WTC complex just before Sept. 11, 2001? 0]

A year later, ZIM was busted with US/Israeli weapons heading to Iran.

So, crime scene evidence, armaments, what else? The closer to the top of the pyramid, the more interconnected it all is. Don't forget that all major art transactions are highly suspect and that ""modern art"" which is a farce, at best, is without value but is great for money laundering. See Miles Mathis excellent paper on this topic here

( http://www.mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf )

Anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?

This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world. If you do not know what the Venice Biennale is, google the logo. Exactly logo to the FBI Boy Lover symbol.

**James Alefantis and the Comet Ping Pong Link**

The Transformer Gallery hosts an annual silent auction, but few have picked up on the detail that every auction requires the transportation of art from another country that we can now know is shipped through diplomatic channels and part of the same larger network of diplomatically-exchanged art. Per the Gallery program:

This is the 13th Annual Auction and a celebration of Transformer’s 15 year anniversary. The Italian Ambassador is our diplomatic chair this year – highlighting year long collaboration with the Italian Embassy in D.C., and artistic exchange with artists and art spaces in Rome and D.C.

From BrightestYoungThings **1**

**1** ( https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/preview-transformers-13th-annual-auction )

>There’s more than 175 works up for silent bidding this year – I think we actually have 190 works! We say this every year – but I truly feel this is our best selection of work up for bidding yet.

For more on James Alefantis and his friends; Google Heavy Breathing, The Apes Band and Pedophilia. 

Be warned, what they say and the images and videos the bands produce are pedophilic in nature and depict torture. Did I mention the main singer of The Apes was a former Special Needs teacher. You can also google her name, I'll let you find it and search her alter-ego drawings of weird creatures. It's as if all of these people were abused in child hood and so too are they doing the same.

**Connection to Skull and Bones**

Alefantis’ connection to Skull and Bones is rather subtle, but it’s telling that all news media has reported Alefantis’ role as an event organizer for this group. This is two-pronged. First, he coordinates events with the Sackler Freer gallery owned by the Opium family. Secondly, regular Comet performer Kid Congo Powers is married to the curator of the Yale University Art Gallery. **1** You know, the former headquarters of Skull and Bones.

**1** ( https://vimeo.com/67959660 )

Kid Congo powers performs with DJ **Baby Alcatraz**, sometimes at Planned Parenthood events. **1** Remember DJ Baby Alcatraz was the one who owned what appeared to be Pizza Map near Marfa. **2** I won't be getting into the details of how perverted these bands are, as that isn't the premise of this post. Do know though, if you google some of these bands do not click tumblr posts of Google+ posts as many lead to boy lover forums and offputting and pedophilic pictures. 

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/F5E0E8a.jpg )

**2** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1647807 )

Kid Congo Powers, former member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, shows a few suspicious habits on his Tumblr. 

( https://imgur.com/a/ip3ZO )

* Making **Erudite references to actual Bavarian Illuminati members and strange comments about the tomb at the Skull and Bones headquarters.**
* Wearing a Bavarian Illuminati-themed Jacket
* Showing up at Transformer auction around ambassadors
* Vampire Teeth, and references to pizza and blood; so not a normal guy. 

We can’t forget Alefantis’ hosting of the Roosevelts and CFR-connected reporters like Wolf Blitzer. **1** A pizza owner who just so happens to know media affiliates for years, who would have thought. The fact that he and Dozoretz are closely linked in hosting these parties, and that major news networks seem just as involved in the afterparties, there’s no question why the entire Beltway wanted to shut this all down.

**1** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770143 )

Note that you see the exact same pattern with Susan Alefantis and the Chris Kloman case. **1** Those who defended Kloman include CFR-connected anchors like Charlie Gibson and Clinton cronies like Ken Starr.

**Uribe and the Colombian connection**

The Colombian ambassador to the United States worked for a law firm that, around the time that Comet Ping Pong first became a household name, became involved in a case of satanic abuse homicide in Bogota. The murder of Yuliana Samboni by Rafael Uribe would not be so intriguing were the diplomatic chair at Alefantis’ 10th annual Transformer Gallery auction not connected to the same law firm as the assailant.

The blog ‘Blueberry Perspective summarizes the link very well. 

>James Alefantis has political ties to the same colombian oligarch family where the rich architect son is involved in a **satanic ritual abuse case** with other people of a rape and murder of a seven year old poor girl, and it's being covered up in the colombian media, and by the colombian police, and colombia is a country that at the same time has the clinton foundation, carlos slim and frank giustra heavily involved in raping the natural resources, fake foundation activities, that all deal with youth and children, and banking regulations, are tied to haiti, robbing oil money killing union leaders and workers rights abuses, running illegal investment slush funds, etc

**Art world connections**

The reason that the wealthy run art galleries is that they have a lot of money and want to engage in improving civic culture. That would be all fine and dandy if nearly every major family involved in the Skull and Bones network seems to have a connection to this Shipping lines. James Alefantis, in a sense, works for the Maccoby family because of their links to the Folgers, one of the families involved in FAPE.

The Folgers are heavily involved in the so-called Skull and Bones power circle, and they share both the credentials of being an early connecticut settler family and having an ancestor who was ambassador to Belgium. Notice Alefantis’ proximity to the Folger family. From this Voat Post:

( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673862 )

>The Folgers, are a secret power elite family since at least the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lee’s mother is Barbara Sue (Bitsy) McElroy.[8] She was the daughter of Harvard’s Neil H. McElroy, former president of the multi-million dollar corporation, Procter & Gamble, and October 9, 1957, appointed President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense. Neil’s grandmother was Mary Camilla Fry of England- baroness, suspected British Knighthood bloodline lineage.[9]

>Neil’s father is financial advisor Lee Merritt Folger– a child sacrifice (Moloch, also spelled Molech) pagan member of the Bohemian Grove.[10] Lee’s father was investment banker, John Clifford Folger (1893-1981), U.S. Ambassador to Belgium (1957-59)- Alfalfa Club.[11] The Folgers are descendants of Peter Folger. Peter was an early 17th century English settler of Martha’s Vineyard.

**Ellen Susman & Pay 4 Play**

Texas Democrat writes to John Podesta asking to be Ambassador to New Zealand after her and her husband donate to HRC. This fits in line with the pay-to-play allegations surfaced by Guccifer 2.0, when he released the ambassador names and the amounts paid to Obama/HRC to get an ambassadorship.

But what’s more interesting is the Ellen Susman sits on the 2015-2016 National Leadership Board of the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.

( http://blantonmuseum.org/national-leadership-board/ http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/well-trod-path-political-donor-to-ambassador.html )

Not everyone wants a gilded posting in a European capital. Ellen Susman, a Texas philanthropist who contributed $100,000 to the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Obama, has alerted people involved in the decision-making of her interest in serving as director of the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, responsible for managing the art collection that hangs in American embassies around the world.

**Amman, Jordan**

But the Transformer gallery not only takes art in from other countries, but also ships the art outward, as well. The presence of art by Matt Sesow, the artist involved in several Transformer auctions and who once painted an uncanny **‘cumpanda’** **1**, was featured in a Jordanian art exhibit. Notice the imagery of the gallery and it’s pederastic “Da Vinci Children’s Exhibition” and the all-seeing eye out front.

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/bdVvSBg.jpg )

An interesting tidbit to add is that a Syrian diplomatic cable showcases one of the Jordanian gallery’s **1** exhibitions (Wikileaks - A Shout Out From My City **2**), and explains that the exhibition occurred under the patronage of the Ambassador to France. What is important to note is that the auction at the Transformer gallery hosted by James Alefantis was always patronized by a guest ambassador, who made a special art donation to the gallery. Is it proof that he’s smuggling children? No. But does it prove that his connections—including to the Rockefeller’s through Luzzatto, to the Rothschilds, to Skull and bones.

**EXTRA INFO**

____

**Historical precedent to Comet Ping Pong -- an 18th century occult club that lured politicians, lobbyists and ambassadors into a web of blood ritual**

Germaine de Staël, was not only connected to major American diplomats, but also to a mysterious building in Switzerland that Tony Podesta seems to be visiting today. Given their current relationship with ambassadors and actual nobility, it is highly plausible that the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are involved in the same type of operation.

**Body**

During the French Revolution, several notable figures at the highest seats of power in Switzerland and France played decisive roles in overthrowing Louis XVI and guillotining the royal family. It's worth knowing that Soros-type bankers still lorded over Europe at the time--after all, this was the age of Rothschild. Jacques Neckar, from Switzerland, was one such rival and became a finance minister under Louis XVI for France. During the revolution, he barely managed to hold France together, but according to Wikipedia, he also helped spark one of the bloodiest days of the Revolution:

>Necker's dismissal on 11 July 1789, provoked by his decision not to attend Louis XVI's speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.

But there's so much more to this. His daughter, Germaine de Staël, was a gifted writer and power player in the French Salons. She would end up being one of Napoleon's sworn enemies as she tried to subvert his power on several occasions. She was also married to the Swedish ambassador in France. While still young, she ran her own salon in Paris with the ambassador, and they quickly gained a reputation as **being a hotspot for the actual Illuminati and Swedenborgian Cult.** Quotes from the book ""Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Stael"" reveal she was known to the American political elite as well.

>Germaine’s salon in the rue du Bac had become a political meeting place for the liberal aristocracy which soon was to carry out the first phase of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morries, a frequent guest, described Germaine to George Washington as “a woman of wonderful wit, and above prejudices of every kind,” and her house as a temple of Apollo.

Evidence also suggests that the Illuminati/Swedenborgians were involved in some bizarre sorcerer deep-state activities, as we see now with Jimmy Savile, 'Especially' Michael Aquino, wikipedia page scrubbed and the 'Podestas' activities.

>[Monsieur de Stael] had also turned to the Swedenborgian sect, was deeply involved in the mysticism of the Illuminati, and indulged in conjuring spirits...In the Age of Reason, at at the court of the enlightened despot Gustavus, two opposed schools of sorcerers and soothsayers were engaged in secret and mortal combat. King Gustavus’ clairvoyant, Miss Arfwedsson, whose oracle he consulted on every important occasion, was all-powerful, but she was decidedly outnumbered by the soothsayers who surrounded the King’s brother, Duke Charles of Sudermania, for whom they predicted a glorious future. Most influential among them was the Duke’s friend, Baron Reuterholm, who, before witnesses, had put the **Duke into a hypnotic trance to make him prophesy the role he was to play in the regeneration of Mankind.**

>Baron de Stael already had attached to his embassy a Swedenborgian named Halldin, whose specialty it was to make spirits appear in mirrors (he thus produced John the Baptist) and **to read the future in books stained with blood.** Under Reuterholm’s influence these innocent pastimes took a more serious turn.

>At one of the seances held in 1790 in Stael’s presence, a medium revealed that Duke Chatlr was “in possession of the truth itself” and that Reuterholm be his only instrument…”Mention of the King was also made; what has been said concerning His Majesty is of great interest but of such a nature that I dare not trust it to my pen.”

They were literally performing mind control/hypnosis to major political figures to help them carry out political goals. This is congruent with allegations of both the CIA and Globalists blackmailing VIP pedophiles to further their aim. What's also interesting is that Le Bac was a favorite among lobbyists, and was actually known to court the most powerful American diplomats at the time. Staël met Jefferson, Washington, Adams; but what's most interesting is that Madame de Staël is (1) in such an identical position to American socialite James Alefantis, who frequently courts ambassadors from his art functions. Think I'm exaggerating? Here he is hosting the Swedish ambassador. **1** Another Transformer event was even held at the French embassy, and Alefantis has helped organize events with actual French nobility. **2** History repeats itself, and there's even MORE proof.

**2** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530742 )

In some amazing coincidence, Stratfor leaks indicate that Tony Podesta was subscribing to Stratfor from a property in Lausanne. **1** Turns out, he's actually connected to Lausanne through his family and through the art world: Several pieces by Giovanni Battista Podesta, one of the purported ""founders"" of Art Brut, appear at the Collection Art Brut, **2** located in a castle in the town called Le Chateau Beaulieu. He is a worshipper of Mammon. **3** If you want a better idea of what art brut is, please look here. **4** Art brut is essentially ""trauma art"", **5** where victims of trauma, including satanist abuse and pedophilia, paint their experiences. I have spoken to actual art brut collectors who have confirmed this, and who have also admitted that many of the artists come from ""transcendental cults"". Also, abuse victim Kim Noble's work is Art Brut. **6**

We also know that Tony Podesta is connected to this Art Brut art movement for three reasons: (1) He opened the **""Art Blu"" café in Venice, where he owns another property, (2)** **1** he owns countless paintings that are or could be deemed Art Brut and (3) **James Alefantis is one of the biggest patrons of art brut on the East Coast, if not America.** And the painters he helps showcase have painted **pedophilia** **2** and **cumpandas** **3** (Matt Sesow, the artist in question, appears to have been a regular at Comet Ping Pong). So what's the big deal with this castle that Podesta is secretly visiting?

* **It's the old home of Jacques Neckar and Madame de Staël.** Literal Illuminati members use to live there and held unimaginable financial power over Europe. Now Tony Podesta is directly involved with visiting the same property as one of the top--if not THE top American lobbyist--in the world.

* **The group at the Chateau Beaulieu appears to be still tied to pedophilia.** 
There is a call to the board at the bottom of the page to go on an excursion ""every leap year"" **1** to Sciacca in Sicily. It's the home of a sculpture garden and art brut artist pictured here. **2** Now it's owned by a **vineyard called Strada Del Vino Terra Sicane.** **This is their logo.** **3** That logo is one we've seen time and again--and yes I am going to make the case that Comet Ping Pong is far, far more than just a one-off fake news hoax. I think it's at the very heart of this organization, whether it be a place to blackmail people or meet secretly with members of the global elite. It's a perfect cover.

Pandora's box has been opened. There are millions of people who feel an election has been stolen. America only retained it's beacon of light because of the rule of law. When that is gone, we stand for nothing. We are no better (whether we were ever really better is up for debate). Covid is seeping into every facet of our life. We feel scared. We feel abandoned. Some feel reality itself has taken a different trajectory in recent years because we are advancing so rapidly in tech and the age of information. Quite frankly, most people don't have the time right now to be concerned with Bigfoot or the Pyramids. 

It doesn't even matter where one stands politically. The elites and Congress were not ready for how fast technology advanced. They are so old they don't understand it. They were not prepared for how fast all of their corruption on both sides would come to light. The damage control and censorship on seemingly every major platform is too much for most to handle. (Reddit, Facebook, Google, Youtube). 

When one side bitches and complains about election fraud, Russian hoax that wasted taxpayer (our) money, also says this is the most election in history, and no fraud is possible, and bans anyone and everyone for bringing it up, it raises eyes. 

Sides have been taken and America has never been more divided than it is. Yes, even more than the Civil War. We're not in trenches drawing battle lines with muskets, but the people are absolutely divided. You can feel it surfing the web. At work. At cafes. Downtown. It's an all encompassing, unescapable feeling that's all consuming. Tensions are boiling. Now throw in the monster that is Covid-19 and you have a perfect recipe for a 24/7 bio political conspiracy. Reddit should have had the foresight to understand by banning the Original TheDonald, his supporters would inevitably spill over. When they are banned from talking about these things, they tend to gravitate to conspiracy minded people. It's basic human psychology. 

When a conspiracy like this exists, to be as frank as possible, nobody gives a single fuck about Bigfoot. These things are affecting our daily lives. Censorship is becoming a harsh reality when it benefits those that control the censorship. Fact-checkers. Shutting down people's businesses. It has gotten out of control. The media can prop Biden up to mutter a few words about ""Unity"" all he wants, but it's an empty song. We now have a nation with over 70 million people who want to see political traitors quite literally hung. I'm not saying I am one of them, but I am saying that is the reality. People feel broken and hopeless inside, while seeing lifelong politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell get rich off our country's lifeblood. And then come on TV and literally insult us by telling us it's our fault. 

There is no accountability. It's never the billionaires fault. It's not the politicans fault. It's not the Governor's fault. It's not WHO's fault. It's not the United Nations fault. It's not the Trilateral Commission's fault. It's not the Bilderberg's fault. It's not foreign leaders fault. It's not China's fault.     It's Our Fault.    

They are trying to hold this mess together by the seems busting apart with ducktape, and it's inevitable. People have awoken to the horrors of corrupt leaders and politicians like never before. Was the election stolen? I don't know. There has been some very convincing data, statistical improbabilities and anomalies, shady behavior on election night, but I do not know. I won't dabble anymore on that. But the greater problem are the lies and corruption itself. It goes beyond the election. People literally, do not know what to believe anymore. Nobody knows the truth, about hardly anything. Sure we are told things. History shows time and time again that we have been lied to. The military-big tech-covid-media complex has formed their sides and drawn their lines in the sand. People are scared. People aren't making their rent and payments. People are scared of a propped up market that doesn't represent reality. People have lost loved ones to Covid. People are tired of being demonized for wanting to spend quality time with their loved ones while politicians throw parties in the Hollywood Hills laughing at us. 

We are living in unprecedented times. So please quit asking why this sub is all political now. It's all connected and we are living through it. It's one of the last somewhat free places on the internet where we can anonymously congregate to talk about these issues. If you want older style conspiracies, try r/highstrangeness  It has all the Bigfoot, aliens, and pyramids conspiracy to last you a lifetime, with quite a large user base. But please quit blaming mods and users for wanting to talk about the greatest umbrella conspiracy, involving so many conspiracies, of our lifetime, on the conspiracy sub.  

Peace and love friends. I don't know how, but we will get through this. I believe in a creator. I believe that life without grace and love is worthless. We are not robots. We are meant to connect and help one another up. Evil will not prevail. It seems bleak and hopeless right now, but I remain steadfast that not only the US, but the world will see better days.

Nobody is forcing you to do anything we just care about your safety, like we always have, signed yours truly, Uncle Sam. 

Anyways, there are no known treatments to help stop Covid, even though it’s a coronavirus with very similar traits to other coronavirus we deal with yearly. You must stay home sick until your about to die. DO IT. When you are finally near death, come to the hospital where we’ll place you on a ventilator to finish the job to receive our government $ kickback.

Wait what? You CANNOT prescribe Ivermectin, we simply cannot risk it, not enough data and testing. Ok whew, now that that’s out of the way, we can finally seek EUA to give out our mRNA vaccines! 

Everyone the day is saved. Get vaccinated. They’re available now. You can’t catch it, spread it, or die from it. 


It’s 95% effective, but wait, just to be sure, you need a second one. Just not with J&J or AstraZeneca, we rolled those out premature and lots of people died haha our bad. 

We need herd immunity. At least 70%. Wait no. 80%. Alright here’s the plan, you need to take TWO shots to be fully vaccinated and then you’re done. 

Maybe we need a Covid pass. Yeah a passport. You’re gonna need it for restaurants, movies, concerts, basic travel, ball parks. 

Oh btw, you still need to wear your mask and quarantine yourself in case you get a break through case. It’s rare. Hardly happens. They are SAFE and EFFECTIVE. Get it. 

Upon further thought, this vaccine isn’t to protect yourself. It’s to protect your loved ones. You can never be too safe. You have to take it. We need to mandate it. For everyone. Hospitals and military, you’re up first!

This pandemic is getting out of hand, we need to flatten the curve more to not overwhelm hospitals! And umm, yeah, we uh, we gotta fire everyone that worked the past 24 months if they won’t get it. 

SAFE and EFFECTIVE god damnit. Hell, mix and match if you want. Start off with Pfizer. Follow up with Moderna. You’re basically bulletproof now.

Look we have lots of studies confirming robust long lasting, durable natural immunity. But do not mention that at all costs. Do not say those words Live on Air. Don’t even hint at it. Shots are the only way.

Wow, year over year a 300% increase in case loads with our vaccinations. Don’t panic you normie, THAT MEANS ITS WORKING.

VAERS is unreliable anyway. Plus, even if 20,000 people are reported dead on there and a Harvard study concludes less than 10% all of known reactions even get sent to VAERS, you can’t trust it. They’re probably alive and we’ll just like Tiffany Dover. She just doesn’t use social media anymore.

Wow cases are rocketing, safe and effective. That means it’s working. It’s working so well we want to give you a booster, it’s the exact same. Well not the kids one, we added an anti heart attack medicine to the concoction so now it’s really just fucking great. 

One of the heads of the FDA stepped down? Ok concerning maybe, but not necessarily remarkable. Wait, the CDC director overrides their own panel in favor of more shots? Well, don’t worry about it. Get your damn shots. And quit asking so many questions.

Social media you are slacking, up your game. Stop this nonsense about natural immunity. Great job Instagram for banning that term. Twitter, you need to censor this harmful disinformation. 

Over 140 million people here have had Covid and recovered? You know, that herd immunity thing we were talking about? Scrap it. Since this virus is less harmful to children than the flu, we recommend all school age children get it. They still have to wear masks too. 

Look, it’s FDA approved baby!! Well ok, none of the others are. Just Pfizer. YES, I realize the technical wording actually says Comirnaty is approved in the future, not what they’re giving out now. Doesn’t matter. SAFE and E-FUCKING-fECTIVE baby!! 

This thing is so good, that we have big exciting news for everyone. Everyone double vaccinated will soon be considered non-vaccinated until you get a booster!! How awesome is that. 3 shots in 9 months you are like The Terminator. But still wear your mask.

Seriously why won’t you get it? DO IT, NOW. It’s the only way out of this. Not zinc, exercise, sunlight, monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, you can’t do that. Vaccines. Only vaccines can beat it. 

We simply don’t have enough information on Ivermectin, but good news, after no long term studies we have officially concluded pregnant women are safe to get them. Also if you’re a pregnant nurse who worked the last 24 months saving lives and don’t want it, you’re fired. We need everyone we can get. This is a SERIOUS pandemic. I’m serious guys.

Look, if you get it, you can be part of a special vaccinated lottery. You can get free beer and donuts, because again, this is for your health. 

We don’t care that Delta and O variant are less deadly than Alpha, it’s contagious. Remember like every other vaccine in history, getting vaccinated was never about protecting yourself, it’s about others. If you don’t double jab, get your booster, mask up, and stay 6ft away from everyone you’re literally a killer. You psychopath. 

Alright, there’s a lot of shady articles about natural immunity, blood clots, strokes, aneurisms, heart attacks, and record high deaths for these and the flu has basically been eradicated, there’s VAERS, there’s cardiologists and epidemiologists who are gravely worried but, the important thing to focus on here, is getting rid of YouTube dislikes and Twitter not be able to report things we don’t like. We need to control the narrative it’s for your own good.

Anyways, I know we’re almost 2 years deep with this, but clearly, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. They’re killing us all. Yes, I got my vaccine, but because my neighbor did not I am at risk. But don’t get it twisted. These are still SAFE and EFFECTIVE. 

Quit worrying about Canada, Austria, Australia, Europe, and all their protests. Quit fucking saying Let’s Go Brandon you god damned fascists, now comply for your 4th shot or you ain’t going anywhere. 

THIS. IS. FOR. YOUR. HEALTH.  You crazy conspiracy nut jobs. This is a naturally occurring virus and didn’t come from the lab. Leave Fauci out of it. He’s basically America’s grandpa and he wouldn’t fucking lie. This is NOTHING like the beginning of Nazi Germany or putting Japanese people into concentration camps. It’s a different kind of camp. And it’s for your own good. 

And one last thing, respect your elders. Bill Gates is smarter than you and it doesn’t matter if they’ve been outspoken in the past about population control. He’s a good guy and is only doing this for his love of humanity. It’s safe and effective.

So please, enough with the Israeli and European data on the clot shots. Stop with your natural immunity hoax stuff. Quit worrying about your right to medical autonomy. Quit bringing up the Nuremberg Code. Stop citing peer reviewed academic journals that doesn’t agree with the *science* . Quit asking god damn questions and listen to me. It’s going to be a dark winter. Get your vaccine, your double vaccine, your booster, and get ready for your 4th in February. It’s fucking safe and effective. Everything is normal. You people are just crazy and vaccine hesitant. Oh shit gotta go. Phone just rang. “Hello Xi” .",conspiracy,hoax
95,I made a post yesterday about Trump and the comments were astonishing. Wanted to make something clear from some of the comments i saw. I'll also make it clear to the shills why this post belongs in this subreddit.,362.0,wb44xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wb44xa/i_made_a_post_yesterday_about_trump_and_the/,895.0,1659099467.0,"1. People were really offensive. That i was brainless, i sucked Trump's balls etc. There were hundreds of comments like this. First of all I wanna make clear something and I know that there are lots of people like me. I don't think that Trump is a politician. He barely was in politics for 4 years. All of these 4 years, he was attacked by MSM, corporations, POLITICIANS of BOTH sides, not just democrats, but also from his republican party. I understand very well that both parties are the wings of the same bird. It's just that I don't think Trump is part of them cause if it wasn't for him, I would never understand how corrupt American politicians are, how corrupt the media is (yes left and right), and would've taken 4 shots and kept 2 masks and would take for granted everything that msm said (sadly I believed the msm, until 2020). I would not understand how the climate thing is a hoax (maybe not in it's entirity), and I would be walking undisturbed towards the great reset. So I give credit to him and other people like him that made me realize lots of things that otherwise I would not understand. I have no interest in sucking Trumps balls, because I don't profit anything by writing good words for him. And to all of the offensive comments I wanna tell only 1 thing ""You showed yourself who you really are. If someone likes someone for doing and exposing something, it's his personal decision and freedom of speech. Don't be negative. If you wanna debate, do it in a civilized way. Bad words just show how poorly your families raised you. This was for the real people. For bots and paid shills I don't have anything to say.
2. I don't idolize Trump. I like him as a person who tried to change something in US. The fact that during his administration lots of good things happened and less of bad things happened, the fact that he exposed the MSM always as fake news (which is true), the fact that he exposed Big Pharma, the fact that went against his ""medical advisors"" like Fauci and Birx etc, made me like him and follow what he said.
3. The fact that he got the boot from the social media because of things he said, and how everything against him stood up in the social media and things pro him got banned, made me like him.
4. About Epstein. Yes, he was friends with him, but as most of you know, he banned him from Mar a Lago, and this was before he was president.
5. I formulated the wrong sentence when I wrote ""there was no covid or things like this"". What I meant was that we were OK and happy with him in power. No problems for 3 years straight. Economy was good. Employment rate was good. Employment of black people was very high. Citizens loved him for this.
6. The fact that the left wing media in these 2 years lost viewers, lost followers on social media, and the conservative media gained a lot of these viewers and followers (often being in synchron with YOU people here in this subreddit that made lots of quality posts), make me believe that the MAJORITY of Americans love Trump. This is not the only indicator of course (and it may even be an irrelevant one), there are lots of other indicators.
7. In my country in Europe, I know very well that politicians were against him. Yeah, the same politicians that made us wear masks and ordered the police to check us if we had the shots and our masks etc. Also, there were some interesting things that my country interfered in the US elections. How...idk. Do I believe this... yes and no for different reasons.
8. He was against mandates. Against shots. Pro 2nd amendment. Pro first amendment. No one was banned for speaking their mind during his Presidency. In 2020 and 2021 and 2022, lots of people were banned that thought like him or liked him. Happened to me too.
9. About the conspiracy, I believe election was stolen for 2 reasons. 1 because he gave the WEF the middle finger in Davos in 2020 (watch his speech on YT if you havent) and immediately after the rona was released. With the releasing of rona the intent was for people not to go in person and vote. That's why he continuingly told the people during his campaign to go and vote en masse. Because it would be much more difficult for the deepstate to cheat. They had to cheat A LOT, in order to defeat Trump. That's why he got 81 million votes (if i recall correctly), more than any incumbent President in history, but Joe broke records...yeah..Joe broke records... The 2nd reason is because that if he stayed 4 more years, after exposing the swamp in his first term, I believe he would keep his word to drain it. The swamp could not allow this cause they would use their miraculous vaccines on people and brainwash them and all the problems from the vaccine, would not exist at all. This brings me to my final point...
10. A lot of you said that he allowed operation warp speed. Yes, I agree with you totally and I was appalled at first. But later I realized that in order for states to reopen (at least the dem ones, cause the others opened much much earlier) and for the economy to regain it's shape , a solution was needed. A solution that even the DS could not counter. Vaccines. But the most important part was that a) he didn't develop the vaccines. b) He NEVER told people to take the vaccine forcibly or to wear masks. He let it in people hands.

So I think the conspiracy is clear. Invite him in Davos 2020 thinking to make him your ""friend"". If yes, continue with the plan. If no, release the rona. Disrupt the election. Bring down the strongest point of his presidency, the economy, install a puppet, do lots of bad things in USA and around the world, and in the end the puppet would be blamed, probably removed with the 25th amendment (or any other method), install another puppet that will do bad things.

If you wanna comment or ask questions to me, please be civilized. I may be wrong and I would like to be proven wrong, even though I think that what I wrote makes sense. Despised him until 2020 (because the msm told me so) and liked him after 2020. This is my opinion.
Edit: For those who don't know who was against him 4 years ago.

\-----

It hit me yet again as I was reading a comment from someone claiming Tom Hanks is ""in on it."" In on what, I'm not sure; the post was about everything from CIA to Rothschild.

And from there the conversation went as it always does...

>""Tom Hanks is in on it? Is there any evidence?""  
*""He has said certain things that suggests so, yes.""*  
""What things?""  
*""He once made a reference to the day he got sick. Of course there's sooo much more to it.""*  
""There's more to it? Like what?""  
*""Oh, he once played in a movie where another character called him Corona.""*  
""Oh...""  
*""Of course there's sooo much more to it, this is just the tip of the ice berg.""*

There's always ""more to it"" and it's always just ""the tip of the ice berg"" and yet no one's ever willing to actually show, link or even explain. All of a sudden, burden of proof is forgotten completely. It's not their job to back up their claims, or prove their theories. It's *your* job to disprove it. [And just like with Russel's teapot, you often can't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)

I have scoured the pizzagate posts, the Cabal videos on youtube, the Rothschild posts and all the little theories in between, looking for *anything* that isn't circumstantial, or at least something that's based on truth. And every single time, there is the same message: *There is more to it. This is just the tip of the ice berg. Do your own research if you don't believe me.*

So I did. And not a single claim held up.

Mel Gibson is still quoted saying that Hollywood feasts on the blood of kids, and yet it's long ago confirmed to have been a hoax article. The three men Titanic was sunk to get rid of, so they wouldn't be alive to oppose the fed, weren't against the fed to begin with, and wouldn't have been able to stop it even if they were. Nazi-symbols are photoshopped into Disney screencaptures. Suddenly there's a new Epstein flight list that no one's been able to match to the actual documentation. Oh, and everyone's a Rothschild now -- all you need is vaguely similar facial features or any association with antlers.

So it made me wonder: these people keep saying it's so painful to know the truth, that it's such a burden to have ""woken up""... But if it's such a burden, why are they willing to just accept it all, even without evidence?

>*“Waking up” is almost unbearable.*  
*My perception of reality has been shattered.*  
*We are enslaved in a man-made prison.*

Usually when you tell people something that upsets them, they're not willing to accept it without proof. But when someone claims that the Rothschild family or Rockefellers own the federal reserve -- a highly unlikely and deeply upsetting claim -- no one's demanding evidence. These theories are more fragile than a house of cards, and yet no one wants to poke at it.

In the Reddit conspiracy culture, there is the idea that blindly trusting the government and the media is naive. And I agree, it is. But then why are you willing to blindly trust these wild allegations? Doesn't it scare you how easily someone in power could manipulate you? For example by making you believe that Hillary and most of the left is part of a pedophile ring and that Hitler was correct in that wealthy Jewish families are evil...

So many people are complaining about how painful it is to ""wake up"" and that the world seems so dark now, but I honestly think it's an act. I think it makes them feel powerful, in control. I think the reason they avoid doing legit research is because they might just find out the world is much more normal than they thought, that Hillary doesn't torture and kill children to drink their blood and that Trump isn't speaking to them in code. And maybe that's worse. It's empowering to imagine that even the 1% can't hide from you. It's much scarier to admit that either a) The world is much more normal -- and boring -- than they thought, or b) It is as scary and dark as they assume, but the real secrets are not so easily uncovered. Because in this reality, they are not part of an unstoppable movement, they have not ""woken up"" and the secrets of the world remain secret.

Just remember:

Climate change, originally called global warming, was later added to extreme climates such as hurricanes and wildfires in order to increase its impact on the public. Countries have developed policies aimed at slowing or halting the trend of climate change, mainly by controlling carbon emissions and introducing alternative energy sources.

## Is the climate change theory true?

Let's look at the numbers.

Human emissions of carbon dioxide account for 3.5% of the earth's greenhouse gases, and the rest of the greenhouse gases come from nature. Among them, ocean water evaporation accounts for 95% of the total greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gases account for 2% of the total atmosphere. Therefore, human emissions of carbon dioxide only account for 0.04% of the total atmosphere. Is this 4 in 10,000 factor enough to turn the climate around?

Sunlight, volcanic eruptions, cosmic rays, the solar system, atmospheric circulation, water vapor, and methane are all factors that affect temperatures more than carbon dioxide, but climate change theorists never mention it.

During the glacial period, the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere was 10 times higher than it is now, and in recent years, the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is the lowest in the history of the earth. What's wrong with this picture?

If you're old enough, you'll remember that in the 1970s, the mainstream media in the United States consistently preached that the world was cooling, and 88 years later, it suddenly took a U-turn and preached that the world was warming.

Is this transition related to carbon dioxide? No. The truth is that the earth's temperature fluctuates periodically, and the 1980s was at the end of the earth's 40-year cooling cycle. Now the ice and snow coverage at the poles is similar to the coverage in the 30s and 40s.

Climate change conspiracy theories say melting ice caps will reduce polar bear populations and lead to more extreme weather. But there are actually five times as many polar bears as they were in 1970, hurricane levels are at their lowest since 1900, and droughts are flat.

Step back 10,000 steps, even if carbon dioxide does affect climate change, let's move on to the discussion.

## Are the emission reduction policies formulated by politicians in various countries effective?

No. The carbon emission caps set by developed countries have caused big companies to move their production lines to Asia and discharge their pollutants in a rougher and more intensive way, as if the greenhouse gases emitted by Asia are not on the earth. Neither demand nor supply has diminished, isn't it fooling yourself to just change production in another place?

Who profited from climate change conspiracy theories?

1. The media got ratings from the audience's ""worrying""
2. Environmental organizations and academic institutions have received donations
3. Some big companies benefit from globalization
4. Others gain an 'environmental protector' image
5. Western leftist politicians play the role of savior to harvest public opinion
6. The CCP is the biggest winner

&#x200B;

## What were the results of the policy implementation?

Developed countries join the Paris climate agreement to set a cap on carbon emissions. This move increases the cost of industries and manufacturing in various countries, causing small factories to close down, and big companies justifiably set up factories in China, where labor and law-abiding costs are lower, and discharge pollution in a rougher, more intensive, and unregulated way.

## Who are the Losers?

U.S native manufacturing and Chinese people. On the one hand, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and other states in the United States, which are deeply affected by globalization, have become ""rust belts"". For example, the once prosperous Detroit Motor City has now become a ghost town.

On the other hand, the GDP created by the Chinese people goes into the pockets of certain CCP families, foreign politicians and international organizations. There is basically no national welfare in China, but the living environment has deteriorated. The CCP has established concentration camps for millions of people in Xinjiang, and obtained low to almost zero labor costs, including women’s hair, internal organs, and Nike factories.

## Vested interests

Large international companies have lower costs and more monopoly advantages in the market. The GDP has grown, the fat cats have become fatter, and the CCP's harvest has been better. The CCP gives part of the dividends to foreign politicians who make policies. Large corporations distribute dividends to environmental groups. The policy has two other benefits for leftist politicians in the West, one of which is maintaining power.

The loss of jobs in the United States has led to the migration of population to big cities and the rise of unemployment. These are all welcome by left-wing politicians, because those who lie down and eat welfare will become their supporters and voter base. Leftist politicians use people's reverence for nature and worries about future uncertainty to garner public opinion and votes.

## Alternative energy is not as green as you think

Has anyone compared the carbon emissions produced by producing an EV battery to the carbon emissions produced during normal car use? Have you considered the environmental pollution caused by the disposal of automobile waste batteries? In fact, more fossil fuels are used to make a solar panel than the fuel needed to generate electricity from fossil fuels over the lifetime of the solar panel!

No one dares to oppose it publicly. Anyone who raised objections was ostracized, suspended, and suppressed. Green energy is a propaganda method for whitewashing and profit-making in the petrochemical industry. It is a means for electric vehicles to obtain government subsidies to catch up with the traditional automobile manufacturing industry.

## Omnipotent environmental protection banner

The fracking method used in the U.S. oil extraction process is strongly opposed by Biden on the grounds of environmental protection. The prohibition policy implemented after he took office has brought major disasters to the U.S. oil extraction industry, destroying 1.1 million related jobs.

Externally, the United States has to resume its dependence on imported oil, while major countries should not rely on imports for industrial and agricultural energy. Internally, the decline in the employment rate, the further migration of population to big cities, and the deterioration of social security have ensnared many to the Democratic Party’s welfare trap.

## The environmental banner is one of the conspiracies of the globalist communist agenda

Several concepts need to be distinguished here: environmental protection, environmental protection movement and environmentalism.

**Environmental protection**, as the name suggests, is the protection of the environment. Since there is human civilization, there has been human protection of the environment. This kind of environmental protection has nothing to do with any political ideology.

**Environmental Protection Movement.** The environmental protection movement is a social and political movement aimed at environmental issues. Its main body is to change environmental policies and public psychology and behavioral habits through massive mass movements, media offensives and complex and ingenious political operations.

**Environmentalism**. Environmentalism is a philosophical thought and political ideology that emphasizes the protection of the environment and the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. The origin of environmental protection movement and environmentalism is not the same as that of communism, but the evil specter of communism is good at kidnapping mass movements, manipulating and exploiting the social situation.

\- - -

Therefore, from the beginning of modern environmentalism, the evil specter of communism has systematically arranged to kidnap it and use it for it's own evil purpose.

The factors behind environmentalism worldwide today are extremely complex. It used moving rhetoric and took advantage of people's kind and beautiful wishes to set off a political movement that swept the world. There are many people who are kind, have a sense of justice, and truly care about the future and destiny of mankind. But the factors behind this movement is the evil specter of communism, which uses the moral high ground of environmental protection to advance its own agenda.

In this movement, environmental protection has been highly politicized, radicalized and even religious; traditional moral foundations have been forgotten, and misleading propaganda and even various coercive political tricks have become the dominant factors. Environmentalism is becoming another form of communism.

However, the globalists and the international elite were not satisfied with just this, and planned the **""Great Reset""** plan in 2020, which was aimed at 'using' the epidemic to promote the totalitarian model to the world and establish a new international order - modern slavery.

I keep telling myself if (more like ‘when’ in my opinion) Trump is inaugurated for a second term and proves that left did in fact meddle in this election that maybe democrats will realize they’ve been lied to, but my guess is this they will be fed more lies and believe those ones as well.

All I really want is the truth and im not afraid of abandoning Trump if my opinion of what happened this election is proven wrong.

Years ago, I came to the sobering realization that the current iteration of humanity is in a bizarre state of servitude. We've been living with the illusion of freedom for so long that we don't know any other way.

And yet, the illusion was so strong, I was wondering why it *seemed* we had so much freedom (unrestricted travel, etc).

In the scenario of humanity as a slave race, the coronavirus illusion makes much more sense.

This hoax is actually the long-awaited emergence of the *true* parasitic so-called ""elite"". We pesky humans were getting *too* smart and *too* creative, and this is one of their last attempts to fully cement their ill-gotten hegemony of the planet.

It remains to be seen if humanity will happily relinquish its sovereignty to an actual Death Cult, or whether we will unite and cast off these shackles.

I just don't understand how Santa is real. I mean, there are over two billion house holds in the world, and eight billion people. I get that he's apparently all magical and stuff, but really? Two billion households in a single DAY? I'm not buying it. 

Isn't it also convenient that he won't go to your house if you're not asleep? That he won't go to your house if you're patrolling the fireplace? Anyway, how the hell does Santa get to a house without a fireplace? 

Also, if Santa and his elves are the ones who are allegedly making the presents, how come my plush toy had an IKEA tag on it? Something's not right here.   


How is it possible that humans have landed on the Moon (allegedly) and land rovers on Mars (allegedly) that can send pictures of Earth back to us (allegedly), but we have never found Santa's workshop? Mindless sheep say ""Oh, but it's invisible!"" Then the logical thinker replies ""Well, maybe the workshop is invisible, but what about Santa and his sleigh and reindeer? Are those invisible too?"" The mindless sheep, falling aimlessly into the trap, reply ""Yes, of course... Otherwise would we see him, but we don't. What's your point?"" At this point, the logical thinker has already won the debate, and says ""Then how do you even know Santa exists, if everything about him is invisible? If his workshop is invisible, his sleigh, his sack of presents, his reindeer, and himself, are all invisible, how do you know if Santa exists, if there is literally no proof? You don't see him, you never have and never will, and you don't even make an attempt to find him, but you're content to go to sleep while your entire narrative crumbles. Pitiful."" 

Unless I find CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE of the existence of Santa, which, despite his allegedly very old existence, there is ABSOLUTELY NONE, then I will believe Santa is fake, and a hoax, and a psychological operation on innocent children.

&#x200B;

Hello.  My name is Chris.  I am nobody, really.  An average citizen.  I am an overweight 42 year old white male from the Midwestern suburbs of the US who has been fortunate enough to live a pretty comfortable life.  I used to be a freelance graphic designer with a focus on small businesses, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that that career and part of my life is more than likely over in light of current events.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

I've always been concerned about social injustice and tried to stay politically informed, even dabbling in some activism here and there.  At times I've stepped away from paying attention for my own mental health, or due to laziness, defeatism, whatever.  But I've never stopped caring, or trying, to fight the good fight and do the right thing.

The news recently has of course swept us all up, and touched all our lives in some way or another.  The world has never seen anything like the ""Coronavirus Pandemic,"" and it's clear that our society will be changed forever when we finally come out the other end of this mess.  But I've had the luxury of time recently, and in reading the news about things that were going on, I couldn't help but notice the patterns, and that a lot of stuff didn't exactly make sense.

So, here we go, with the ""conspiracy theory.""

I hate that term, because although it's technically accurate, it's been demonized and weaponized by the media and society at large to take on a bad connotation.  Tinfoil hats, alien abductions, crazy people muttering to themselves, etc.  You've no doubt got a lot of images in your mind of a conspiracy theorist.

And make no mistake, what I'm going to tell you here is all currently very popular conspiracy theory.  However, I think that by removing opinions and conjecture from it, and focusing on facts and things that have already happened, I can present this huge amount of overwhelming, disparate information in a way that makes it less a ""theory"" and more a ""research project.""  And so that is how I have approached this.

I have spent the last week doing little else besides reading every news and opinion article I could find, saving and organizing hundreds of links, and assembling a coherent, logical outline to organize and present these theories, and more importantly, facts.  There are a lot of less-than-reputable sites and publications out there, and I have tried when at all possible to provide sources from verifiable news sites, with a wide range of slants and focuses, to illustrate that what is happening is not part of any one particular political agenda.

I hope that you take the time to check the links, really look into the information presented here, and form your own opinions.  Please do not just take my word for it.  To that end, there are also a few links mixed in that are labeled as having come from r/conspiracy.  These are well-written and well-reasoned posts from other concerned citizens that I think are worth reading, and relevant to the discussion here.

One last thing - If you are new to most of these ideas, the information presented here is more than likely going to seem overwhelming at first.  I encourage you now, and always, to take mental health breaks for yourself, and put down your phone or turn off your computer.  The information will be here when you come back.  And as you'll soon understand, what is happening is an unstoppable tide, truly a force of nature at this point, and there is nothing you can do to fight it, so try your hardest to relax, put on some chill music, hug your dog, and most of all...

BREATHE.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you start researching conspiracy theory, you're going to find a lot of information.  Some much better or worse presented than others, and some much more plausible or unbelievable than others.  Despite the seeming ridiculousness of some things you might read, I encourage you to always approach new information with an open mind.

That said though, I have one main principle that guides all my beliefs about conspiracy theories, and that is the ""Filter of Likelihood.""  Essentially, you have to ask yourself how possible, how likely, and how feasible a piece of information is.  Furthermore, you need to ask yourself what the motivation would be.  In many cases, it's quite easy to see how something makes a lot of sense based on other known info, whereas some theories seem rather implausible no matter how you look at it.

I am interested only in the plausible, and where possible, the already actualized.  Additionally, there's a lot to be said, and a lot that has already been written on many of these topics, so I will focus on current events and simple concepts.

I will also ask you to open your mind to possibility.  Please consider this as you evaluate new information:

1. Do you believe there are things going on in the world that you don't know about yet?
2. Do you believe that there is technology and science you've never heard of?
3. Do you believe that society is progressing at an increasing rate?
4. Do you believe that as populations grow, we require new societal strategies?
5. Do you believe that those with power and money want to retain their power and money?

Of course you believe all these things, and none of these are wild or unusual concepts.  Rather, these are very basic concepts that apply to everyone, and always have.  They are all part of our shared human experience, and undeniable facts of life.  Populations grow, societies evolve, technology advances, and the world changes.  And most important to our discussion here, people, families, and empires constantly [jockey for power and control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-evIyrrjTTY), while fighting for resources, power, fame, and...

**MONEY.**

We all hate TicketMaster, right?  Who do they think they are, what the hell is this bullshit ""service fee,"" etc.  It's something everyone can get behind.  But did you know that TicketMaster willingly cultivates that image?  That venues, teams, and artists, in their pursuit of more money, [raise fees and then let TicketMaster be the bad guy and take the heat so their reputations remain intact](https://stubcrew.com/the-ugly-truth-about-ticketmaster-fees/)?

There are many more people, organizations, and other entities in the world playing that same role for those who really have the money, who really call the shots.  And those who call the shots work very hard and spend absolutely unfathomable amounts of money, time, and blood, to make sure that you don't ever realize who's actually taking your money.

They do this in the simplest, easiest way.  If you simply control information from the top down, and disseminate it when and where you see fit, you can effect great societal change without lifting a finger.

Please imagine... really, try to imagine...  You just read an article, saw a video, whatever, from a very, very reputable source.  And it just informed you that an asteroid was 83% likely to impact the Earth next month.  What would you do? What would happen in the world?

Hopefully an asteroid will not hit next month, but it's important to really imagine what would happen and why, and how.  Because a huge amount of information would be generated and published, people would panic, society would crumble, and the world as you know it would change forever in an instant, the moment you read that headline.

Control of information is one of the most powerful tools known to mankind today.  A person living in 2020 can easily encounter as much information in a day as someone in Medieval times might have encountered in a lifetime.  And it comes at you from all angles, in all forms, non-stop, 24/7.  Much like the water in the pipe, the information is always there, and one needs but turn it on.

Disseminating the information then becomes a practice all its own, and to be sure, [information processing accounts for more than half of the US GDP.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/shenk-data.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)   And the rate at which it's spread, and way it is handled makes a huge difference in the societal repercussions.  So a few different techniques are used:

* **The ""Slow Walk""** \- If a large, unexpected piece of information is given suddenly, people tend to react poorly and irrationally.  Also known as ""letting them down easily,"" this technique restricts the flow of information to prevent the audience from balking or being overwhelmed
* **The ""Steady Drip""** \- This technique involves keeping your audience subjected to a constant stream of the desired information, so that they become accustomed to it and it becomes ""normalized""
* **The ""Firehose""** \- A deluge of information flying out at full blast, designed to overwhelm the audience so that they cannot focus on anything else

It might be the greatest understatement of all time to say that there has been a lot of information passed around about COVID-19, the ""Coronavirus,"" recently.  In fact, there has never been anything like what we are currently experiencing in all of human history, and not by a long shot.  And this unprecedented turn of events has caused a lot of people to react in a lot of ways, and say and do a lot of things, for better or for worse.

Full disclosure: In particular, if you look up conspiracy theory, you'll see a lot of stuff suggesting that the ""Coronavirus is a hoax.""  (You'll also find a lot of poorly-written rambling)  I want to be clear that I DO NOT believe that.  I am 100% sure that there is a Coronavirus, that it is making people sick, that a lot of people are dying, and that our medical professionals and many other undervalued workers are overwhelmed, and breaking their backs every day to do their best to keep their friends, families, and loved ones safe.  I am extraordinarily grateful for them and admire the resolve and bravery that so many have shown in the face of this disaster.  I do not think it is a hoax at all.

However, I think that literally everything else that is happening surrounding the ""pandemic"" is.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**The Pandemic**

In the first week of January this year, I got sick.  Really sick.  I know when I got it and who I got it from, and honestly the exact moment I got it (I only was in proximity of the dude for a few minutes).  He had warned me that he was really sick, and I blew it off.  I started feeling sick a day or two later, and a day or two after that I felt like I was dying.  Fever, chills, aches, extraordinary fatigue.  And literal, nonstop, 24/7 coughing.   I had every single symptom of what we now know as COVID-19.  I commented to anyone who would listen that I didn't recall ever feeling that sick before in my entire life.  The most memorable part of it though was that after a couple days, I completely lost my sense of smell and taste.  Joked a lot about how you could feed me onions and soap cause I'd have no idea.  I try to have a good attitude about being sick.

I spent a week sleeping on the couch before I finally went to the doctor.  She gave me a Prednisolone steroid pack (which has worked well for me in the past), some Trazodone to knock me out, and Benzonatotate for my cough.  As soon as I took the first dose of steroids I started to feel pretty fucking great, and it was more or less a non-issue after that.

I spoke to a lot of people about it then and after, and man, I can't tell you how many stories I personally heard from people I know that said the exact same thing.  Then I started reading the same story over and over again on Reddit:

* [Please leave your experience from November-January if you were Extremely Ill](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjvtdo/please_leave_your_experience_from_novemberjanuary/)
* [An Illness swept through Utah back in December/Early January, was it Covid-19? Did this happen elsewhere?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fotr6p/an_illness_swept_through_utah_back_in/)
* [How long do you really think covid19 has been in the US?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjveej/how_long_do_you_really_think_covid19_has_been_in/)

We didn't start really hearing about the Coronavirus in the media until the beginning of March, and we didn't hear about the ""Pandemic"" until just a couple weeks ago.  And what a couple weeks it's been since then.  But I am quite certain that it's been around for a lot longer and that I, and a lot of other people I know, had it - and DID NOT DIE FROM IT - way back in January.

We now know that the [first documented case in the US was on January 19th,](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) but that word ""documented"" is so, so important here.  That means that we had identified the virus, developed a test, and tested a person with the symptoms that day.  It does NOT mean that was when the virus reached the United States.  How sick do you have to be before you take a day off work? Before you go to the doctor? With America's healthcare system or lack thereof, it's almost certain that many people had this virus before we determined what it was, and how infectious it really was.

There is also the matter of the statistics of severity vs the regular flu.  This is a highly contentious topic and I am no medical expert, and do not wish to make any assertions.  However, what I can tell you from my personal experience is this: I had a horrible ""flu"" in January, got basic medicine, got better.  So, either I had the flu, or perhaps I did indeed have the Coronavirus.

We will never know because I was never tested.  But the important thing is that it *doesn't matter.*  Either I (and many others) had the Coronavirus and it did not kill us (calling into question the severity of the infection) or we just had a bad cold or flu, but it had the exact same symptoms as COVID-19 (calling into question the extent of Coronavirus diagnoses).  But logically, one of those two statements is true.

Furthermore, the data keeps changing, and I don't mean increasing on a daily basis.  I mean up and down, back and forth, it is deadly or maybe it isn't, etc.  On January 14 [the WHO told you it couldn't spread from human to human.](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152)   But then on Jan 19 we saw the [first case of Coronavirus in the United States](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191).  Then it turns out that the [Wuhan market outbreak began earlier in December](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/03/26/Report-Wuhan-market-outbreak-began-earlier-in-December/3021585151249/?ds=5). And then it's an ""epidemic,"" but [most people will only get mild symptoms](https://www.newsweek.com/these-are-mild-coronavirus-symptoms-most-people-covid-19-will-get-1494376).  What are you supposed to believe?  And it sure does seem to come at you as a firehose, and it's hard to even think about anything because OHMYGODTHECORONAVIRUS!

But let's stop and look a couple basic facts.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to let Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi explain this one to you.  This is a very informative 10 minute video, watch it:

[Sucharit Bhakdi - Very clear math showing that the COVID statistics are being manipulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBB9bA-gXL4)

So 80% of people only experience mild symptoms, and we're crashing the economy for this?  The statistics aren't any more extreme than many other illnesses we've had over time, and we're crashing the economy for this?  It doesn't make sense until you consider that there are other factors besides just the virus at play.

[Wolfgang Wodard - Explaining how the statistics are being manipulated to cause panic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyuhbnPOI)

The media, and society at large is inundating you with terrifying information about the Coronavirus.  But if it's not as bad as we originally thought, then why?  We don't freak out about every illness that comes along, and we've certainly never in the history of civilization had over [1/3 of the global population locked down under mandatory quarantine.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/one-third-of-humanity-under-virus-lockdown/ar-BB11Fk7V?li=BBnbcA1)

And then there's the debate about where the virus came from.  We believe it came from a meat market in China, under unsanitary conditions.  The science behind a coronavirus making the leap from one species to another is well-established and researched, and it is a very likely scenario.  There are also conspiracy theories that state that China released it on its people intentionally, or even that the US military released it in China.  Again, we will never know exactly where this Coronavirus came from.  It may be natural, it may be man made, and there are very plausible paths for both.  I don't know what to believe myself.  So here I ask you to make your own judgement based on likelihood.

What we do know though is that the state of the world this virus has been unleashed on has played a major factor in its spread.  In 1950 the global population was 2.5 billion, and that has exploded to almost 8 billion people in 2020.  As a matter of fact, [population growth has been exponential since about the time of the Industrial Revolution.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)

With all these people on the planet there are sure to be many disagreements and conflicts, and there indeed have been.  As a matter of fact, 2019 saw global protests on an unprecedented scale, in Hong Kong, France, Syria, and many other countries.  Citizens have literally been [fighting police and military with rocks, clubs, arrows, and molotov cocktails.](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/17/780268841/hong-kong-protests-intensify-with-molotov-cocktails-and-arrows)

Did you know that?  Despite my seeing headlines and pictures every day of the riots in Hong Kong, I have been shocked to learn that multiple of my close friends, intelligent and aware people, had no knowledge whatsoever of the protests even existing.  But that is far from a coincidence; rather, it is quite by design.

**Billionaires and Coincidences**

Another major talking point over the last 5 to 10 years has been the ""1%"" - the handful of super-rich individuals who posess and control the vast majority of the Earth's wealth and resources.  Where it used to just be a numerical term, ""Billionaire"" is now a dirty word, and one of the nastiest.  We all hate billionaires.  They are evil, and profit off the exploitation of the rest of the world.

The ""Illuminati"" we call them, in pursuit of a ""New World Order.""  Crazy stuff, right?  Mysterious symbols and people in black robes doing nefarious things in secret meetings, and running the world from behind the scenes.  We love the Illuminati, it's a huge pop culture thing now.  The subject of endless speculation, they are made fun of in the media, movies, and now Taco Bell commercials.  It's so far fetched it could never really be true.  And the fact that you think that is by design as well.

So, we don't know where the Coronavirus came from, but it's certainly here, and there are lot of other things unfolding in the world around it.  Many different current events from all different places and fields of study.  Some of it seems a little too coincidental.  It is certainly very coincidental that this economically destructive Coronavirus entered the world right as there were global uprisings, protests in the street, and a growing public hatred for billionaires.

Well, here are a few other coincidences:  [Hundreds of CEOs of major companies stepped down from their positions in recent months.](https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/the-great-ceo-exodus-of-2020/)  Multiple [US Senators sold stock right before the market crashed.](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market) Even the [boss of the New York Stock Exchange sold his own stock](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyse-jeffrey-c-sprecher-kelly-loeffler-sold-company-stock-ahead-of-coronavirus-market-meltdown/) right before the crash.  Did they know something they weren't telling us?

Here's another coincidence.  In 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation published a selection of future-predicting scenarios in the name of ""exploring the ways that technology and development could co-evolve.""  One of these four scenarios, entitled ""[Lock Step](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf),"" eerily predicts a global viral pandemic and the resulting hypothetical consequences, which almost exactly mirrors the COVID-19 pandemic we are in the midst of today.

Also coincidental: [The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in China on November 17th, 2019](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back).  Literally one month earlier, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted [Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY.  In this exercise, they discuss the potential implications and consequences of a novel Coronavirus, including an economic crash, martial law, and of particular interest, the control of information.  (You can view some published highlights [here](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html#highlights))

The [World Economic Forum is comprised of the richest of the rich.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Membership)  The 1%. The Billionaires.  CEO's, politicians, business owners, and many other powerful and influential figures.  They meet regularly to discuss topics of global concern, and [strongly control the dissemination of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos).  And of primary concern to many of them is maintaining their wealth and power in a rapidly-changing world.

And finally, here's one more coincidence:  At the exact same time as the Event 201 exercise, [The World Military Games was held in Wuhan, China, Oct 18-27, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Military_World_Games).  It was the largest military sports event ever to be held in China, with nearly 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries competing in 27 sports.  Wuhan China was, as we now believe, the source of our current global COVID-19 outbreak.

Whether you think it is a ""conspiracy"" or not, that is all certainly coincidental, to say the least.

***""Why didn't I hear about any of this?""***

That's an excellent question, and one that likely has multiple answers.  For starters, how much do you really pay attention?  Where do you get your news from?  Do you research things you hear or just accept them on hearsay?  Critical thinking skills are paramount in making sense of the chaos unfolding all around us.

As I mentioned before, I can tell you that I personally know multiple people who had no clue whatsoever about the riots in Hong Kong last year.  As you read this, you may be one of them.  And it may seem like something that is happening far away, and ""could never happen here."" Or you may have been aware of it but just that it was happening.  But please, consider for a moment: millions of average citizens risked their lives and safety in the streets of Hong Kong for months on end, fighting police and military, and transforming the city they lived in into a warzone.  WHY?  Why would people do something like that?  Regardless of their motivations, that many people were banding together to fight for something they believed in.  And that is worth considering.

It's not really your fault though that you may not catch wind of all this news.  The ""mainstream media"" that you hear about all the time deliberately controls information - downplaying threats and overreacting to silly things - in order to make sure that you hear the version of the news that they want you to hear.

Did you know that only [6 corporations control 90% of the media In America](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6)?  That number is reduced from 50 companies in the 80's.  And literally all the news you see on TV, at the very least, is 100% owned and controlled by these companies.  Lately, distrust is growing for cable news networks, and many people turn to their local hometown station for trusted news.  The problem with that though is that your hometown station is [probably owned by Sinclair Media](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17202824/sinclair-tribune-map), one of the most powerful broadcast networks in the country that you've never heard of.

Please watch this very brief video, illustrating the [chokehold that Sinclair Media maintains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/02/598794433/video-reveals-power-of-sinclair-as-local-news-anchors-recite-script-in-unison) over your nightly local news broadcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI)

Of course, not every piece of news is pre-programmed but a lot is.  The real news is out there, but sometimes you have to look a little deeper than the infographics on TV news.  Even if information is being directed from the top down, the boots on the ground tend to be passionate people with a variety of interests and agendas, and they are still doing their best to do real journalism despite corporate oversight.

Think of those who are directing the information as steering an impossibly massive ship with a rudder.  You can slowly adjust the course of direction, however it is slow to react.  If you want to stop, you have to start thinking about stopping wayyy ahead of time.  And similarly, once it gets underway, it is then influenced by an inertia all its own.  Micro controls and adjustments aren't really possible.

Our society is this giant ship.  There are 8 billion people on this earth - that is 8000 million.  An incomprehensible number that grows rapidly every day.  As civilization grows and advances, so does our medicine, our technology, our cultural norms.  These are all natural processes that are necessary to manage an increasing number of societies all around the globe.  And many of the advances we're making have exciting potential benefits for humanity, although as with all tools, they also inherently possess the potential for abuse.

* [ID2020](https://id2020.org/)  \- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is developing human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can contain financial data, medical records, tracking tech, and more.

There is an interesting chicken or egg relationship between science fiction and real world science.  Sci-fi writers are inspired by the real science of the day, then they apply their creativity to imagine what might be in the future.  Young scientists encounter these fantastical ideas and think they are worth pursuing, and then set about to make them a reality, and the cycle continues.

Futuristic concepts are then preempted and introduced through the media to the conscious mind, as we include them in books, movies, TV, video games, and more.  Eventually we start seeing headlines of these new technologies and developments happening in other places, usually Japan and China first due to their prevalence in the industrial and technological sectors of our global economy.

# Why is the Nephilim (Giants) hidden from modern day archaeology & history?

# The Nephilim /ˈnɛfɪˌlɪm/ (Hebrew: נְפִילִים‬, nefilim) were the offspring of the ""sons of God"" and the ""daughters of men"" before the Deluge, according to Genesis 6:1–4.

When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the **sons of God** saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. Then the Lord said, “My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.

— Genesis 6:1–4, New Revised Standard Version

The story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the **Book of Enoch**. The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge'ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and Jubilees obtained in the 19th century and held in the British Museum and Vatican Library, connect the origin of the Nephilim with the **fallen angels**, and in particular with the egrḗgoroi (watchers). Samyaza, an angel of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:

And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ""Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children."" And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: ""I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin."" And they all answered him and said: ""Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing."" Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it ...

In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the Elioud, who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.

# The Book of Giants

The Book of Giants is an apocryphal Jewish book which expands a narrative in the Hebrew Bible. Its discovery at Qumran dates the text's creation to before the 2nd century BC.

The Book of Giants is an antediluvian (pre-flood) narrative that was received primarily in Manichaean literature and known at Turpan. However, the earliest known traditions for the book originate in Aramaic copies of a Book of Giants in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Furthermore, references are found in: Genesis 6:1-4, 1 Enoch, and visions in Daniel 7:9-14. This book tells of the background and fate of these Nephilim in the flood.

The Book of Giants consists of a group of Aramaic fragments. Because of the fragmentation of the Book of Giants, it is difficult to know the order of the content. This work is related to the 1 Enoch analogue, which tells a story of the giants that is far more elaborate. Further, the Qumran Book of Giants bore resemblance to the Manichaean Book of Giants that followed after it.

The Book of Giants is an expansive narrative of the biblical story of the birth of giants in Genesis 6.1-4. In this story, the giants came into being when the sons of God had sexual intercourse with mortal women who birthed a hybrid race of giants. These giants partook in destructive and immoral actions, which devastated humanity. When Enoch heard of this, he was distressed and asked God to bring judgement to the giants. In his mercy, God chose to give the giants a chance to repent by transmitting dreams to two giants named Ohyah and Hahyah who relayed the dreams to an assembly of giants. The giants were perplexed with the dreams, so they sent a giant named Mahaway to Enoch’s abode. Enoch interceded on their behalf and gave tablets to the giants with the meaning of the dreams and God’s future judgement. When the giants heard this, many chose to act in defiance to God. While the Qumran fragments were incomplete at this point, the Manichaean fragments tell of the hosts of God subduing the race of giants through battle.

Most of the content in the Book of Giants is derived out of 1 Enoch 7:3-6 . This passage sheds light on the characterizing features of the Giants. It reveals that the Giants were born of the sons of god and daughters of man. The giants began to devour the works of men and went on to kill and consume them. They also sinned against the birds and beast of the sky, creeping things and the fish of the sea. It also mentions that the giants devoured the flesh of one another and they drank the blood. This act of drinking blood would have horrified the people. There is further evidence of this in Leviticus 17:10-16. In this passage there are strict rules regarding the blood of the animal. In verse 10 and 11, it says, “I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood and I will cut them off from the people. For the life of the creature is in the blood.”

The text relates how some giants, named Ohya, Hahya and Mahway, sons of the fallen angels, have some dreams that foresee the biblical Flood. A brief mention of one of these giants, ""Ohya"", is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Nidah, Ch 9), where it is said ""סיחון ועוג אחי הוו דאמר מר סיחון ועוג בני אחיה בר שמחזאי הוו"" (""Sihon and Og \[from the Book of Numbers\] were brothers, as they were the sons of Ohia the son of Samhazai \[one of the leaders of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch\])"". The version found at Qumran also describes the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba.

# ANNUNAKI

In his 1976 book [The Twelfth Planet](https://amzn.to/2AyqBzE), Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin claimed that the **Anunnaki** were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings from the undiscovered planet Nibiru, who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. According to Sitchin, the Anunnaki genetically engineered homo erectus to create modern humans to work as their slaves. Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were forced to leave Earth when Antarctic glaciers melted, causing the Flood of Noah, which also destroyed the Anunnaki's bases on Earth. These had to be rebuilt and the **Nephilim**, needing more humans to help in this massive effort, taught them agriculture. Ronald H. Fritze writes that, according to Sitchin, ""the Annunaki built the pyramids and all the other monumental structures from around the world that ancient astronaut theorists consider so impossible to build without highly advanced technologies."" Sitchin also claimed that the Anunnaki had left behind human-alien hybrids, some of whom may still be alive today, unaware of their alien ancestry. Sitchin expanded on this mythology in later works, including The [Stairway to Heaven](https://amzn.to/2ACsziK) (1980) and [The Wars of Gods and Men](https://amzn.to/2O5DiDZ) (1985). [In The End of Days: Armageddon and the Prophecy of the Return](https://amzn.to/2MhsFhb) (2007), Sitchin predicted that the **Anunnaki would return to earth**...

# GIGANTISM

Is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above average. In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone in childhood resulting in people between 7 feet (2.13 m) and 9 feet (2.72 m) in height.

It is a rare disorder resulting from increased levels of growth hormone before the fusion of the growth plate which usually occurs at some point soon after puberty. This increase is most often due to abnormal tumor growths on the pituitary gland. Gigantism should not be confused with acromegaly, the adult form of the disorder, characterized by somatic enlargement specifically in the extremities and face.

# The Kandahar Giant

Rather than the old skeletons, I'm more interested in 'The Kandahar Giant' conspiracy theory because it's about U.S. soldiers fighting & taking a 12' - 15' fair skinned, red haired giant, with 6 fingers & 6 toes, in Afghanistan.

* Soldiers at the base began to hear rumors of a man being killed that was 3 times the height of an ordinary human. Paranormal researcher L.A. Marzulli corroborated the account with two soldiers, and Afghan locals told stories of cannibalistic giants living in nearby caves.
* George Noory interviewed the helicopter pilot that transported the “Kandahar Giant” on Coast to Coast radio. The pilot said it was a dead guy “about 9 by 12 feet… laying in a fetal position on the pallet. He was around an 1100 pound guy.” The pilot went on to corroborate that the giant was fair-skinned, red-haired, and had extra digits on his hands and feet.

In 2002 a U. S. patrol had gone missing in a very remote area of Afghanistan. Another patrol was dispatched on a search and rescue mission, and one soldier on that patrol described what he saw after coming around the side of a mountain:

>^(""As we bent around this corner you could see the opening of the cave. And then I see a lot of rocks which is another oddity. And then bone matter. I’m not close enough to identify what kind of bones but I did see what I knew to be a piece of our communications equipment. So instantly we’re thinking ‘ambush,’ maybe animal, you know, could be anything. There was enough room in front of the cave, but it had a sheer drop-off; but there was enough room that we got into a decent dispersal in case of ambush."")

Not long after they had gotten into that dispersal formation, they saw something emerge from the cave that, despite their preparedness, caught them fully off guard.

>^(""It was a man at least 12 to 15 feet in height. This is a MONSTER. Red beard, with his hair–was longish, past his shoulders, a scarlet red. And Dan runs at him and starts shooting, which broke all of us into the reality–because it was surreal."")  
>  
>^(""While Dan is moving at him, another bro of mine is laying down fire and I start firing. He skewers Dan–he’s now got him on this ‘pike.’ It went through him. He’s got him and he’s coming after more."")

Eventually, the giant was killed. Dan had been killed as well. And the patrol unit was soon visited by a helicopter that dropped some cargo netting. They were told they had to bundle up the giant in the netting, and soon after they were done, a larger helicopter came by, dropped a hook, and the giant was carried off.

The soldier confirmed that the red-haired, fair-skinned giant had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. After they had submitted their after-action report, the soldier recounts that they were told by their top brass to re-write it in a particular fashion, presumably to remove any mention of a giant being.

Although not an eyewitness, another special ops soldier in Afghanistan provides the following corroborating testimony:

>^(""We would come back to the base and started hearing this rumor about a unit that killed this, what they started calling this really tall person. At first I didn’t think anything of it, then come to find out that the person they killed was actually three times the size of a man, had extra digits on their hands, and extra digits on their feet, and had red hair, and a special unit had come in and wanted this target."")  
>  
>^(""Well we’d heard that they killed this thing inside a cave, or the mouth of a cave, and there was common knowledge among the military to hear this. When you first hear, you’re thinking like, this has got to be a joke. This has got to be a hoax. Then after things go down a certain way, and you keep hearing it, you start to realize it’s not a joke."")  
>  
>^(""They kept telling us to keep our weapons high, which normally means it’s two to the chest, one to the head, but they kept telling us to put it towards a man’s head, and put it higher. So we would question, why would they want us to shoot higher than a man’s head?"")

Then there's conspiracy theories about very tall super soldiers. Are they or have they weaponized giants for war?

If they found the 'Fallen Angels' in Antarctica, they may want to control them, use them, or even **weaponize** them too IMO.

Please let me know of any other modern day Nephilim Conspiracy Theories to add to the list.

Are these just Conspiracy Theories or are they reality? If they're reality, why is it being covered up -- especially when it would prove the existence of GOD or even extra-terrestrials IMO.",conspiracy,hoax

([LifeSiteNews](https://www.lifesitenews.com/canada/)) – The pro-medical freedom group US Freedom Flyers (USFF) is suing Atlas Air with the help of John Pierce Law, and plans to sue every major U.S. airline.

— Monica Matthews On Air (@monicaonairtalk) [May 26, 2022](https://twitter.com/monicaonairtalk/status/1529797967988891649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

This is the first lawsuit to make it to court on behalf of USFF, but according to the [*Epoch Times*](https://www.theepochtimes.com/18-major-airlines-faa-and-dot-to-be-sued-over-covid-vaccine-mandates_4484295.html?slsuccess=1), there are “plans to sue all major airlines, 18 altogether, plus the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT).”

The contention on behalf of USFF is that the COVID jab mandates imposed by various federal regulators are unconstitutional for reasons of medical and religious liberty.

The lawsuit, which can be found [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22035148-usff-v-atlas-air-complaint-final), reads: “Fundamentally, this case is about whether Americans should be required to choose between their livelihoods and being coerced into taking an experimental, dangerous medical treatment.”

The founder of John Pierce Law is attorney John Pierce, who previously represented George Papadopoulos as part of the “Russia Hoax” saga. He is also representing January 6 defendants.

Pierce told the *Epoch Times*: “So the complaint has been filed. We’re in the process of serving everyone. And then, we’ll likely be looking for some kind of injunctive relief here soon to make sure that all the COVID-related mandates stop immediately. And then we’ll proceed \[with\] litigation, motion, practice, and discovery and then onward to trial eventually.”

United Airlines is the next major airline on USFF and Pierce’s list.

“We’ll be hitting basically all of them in sequence,” he added. “And then we’ll be going after the FAA as well. We’re gonna get these vaccine mandate type of rules and COVID restrictions ruled unconstitutional.”

Pierce also said that his firm will prove that there was “discrimination” under Title VII. Title VII is a [statute of the 1964 Civil Rights Act](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) that “prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.”

**First**, a link to the wikipedia page for *the protocols* so those interested can see how much of what you're about to read is omitted from there:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

------

The book in which they [the Protocols] are embodied was first published in the year **1897** by **Philip Stepanov** for private circulation among his intimate friends. The first time Professor **Sergius A. Nilus** published them was in **1901** in a book called **The Great Within the Small** and reprinted in **1905**. A copy of this is in the British Museum bearing the date of its reception, August 10, 1906.

All copies that were known to exist in Russia were destroyed in the Kerensky regime, and under his successors the possession of a copy by anyone in Soviet land was a crime sufficient to ensure the owner's of being shot on sight. ([source](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/6519432592.pdf)):

>The best evidence of the genuineness of the Protocols is that in March, 1917 the Bolshevik Revolution took place in Russia and one of the first things done upon the Jewish Bolsheviks taking power was to destroy all copies of Professor Sergius A. Nilus’ book, The Great Within the Small, by. That book, which was first published in Tsarskoe-Tselc (Russia) in 1901, contained The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. All copies of the Protocols that were known to exist in Russia were destroyed during the Kerensky regime. The law followed by Kerensky’s communist successors to power was that the possession of a copy of the Protocols by anyone in the Soviet Union was a crime punishable by being shot on sight

>...Professor Nilus was arrested by the Cheka (Russian Secret Police) in Kiev. He was imprisoned and tortured. The Jewish president of the court, told Professor Nilus that the brutal treatment he received was as retribution for ""having done them incalculable harm in publishing the Protocols.""  

[2011] **Solving the Mystery of Babylon the Great** by Edward Hendrie

>The attack on the Protocols in the 1920’s proved above all else the truth of their contention; it showed that the standing organization for suppressing public discussion of the conspiracy had been perfected in the intervening 120 years . **Probably so much money and energy were never before in history expended on the effort to suppress a single document.**

[1956] **The Controversy of Zion** by Douglas Reeds

In **1865** the Jewish Rabbi **RZEICHORN**, made a speech in Prague. The speech was published 11 years later by Sir John Radcliff, who was assassinated shortly after its publication and it became almost extinct for years. Here are a few passages; 

>""With Gold one can buy the most upright consiences, with Gold one can fix the value of every stock, the price of every merchandise, one can loan it to states that afterwards one holds at ones mercy.     

>""Already the principle banks, the stock exchanges throughout the world, the loans to all governments are in our hands. ""The other great power is the press. By ceaselessly repeating certain ideas, the press in the end makes them considered as truths. The Theatre renders similair services, every where theatre and press follow our directives. By an indefatigable campaign in favour of the democratic form of government, we will divide the Gentiles amongst themselves in political parties, we shall thus destroy the unity of their nations, we will sow the seeds of discord. Powerless they will have to accept the laws of our bank, always united, always devoted to our cause.     

>""The possession of land has always procured influence and power. In the name of social justice and equality, we will divide the great properties; we will give small fragments to the peasents who desire it with all their heart, But who will soon be indebted to us by the very exploitation of these properties. Our capital will enable us to be the real masters.     

>""Let us use all force to replace the circulation of gold by that of paper; our banks will absorb the gold, and we shall decide what then what value the paper money will have, this will make us masters of every mans existence.     ""We will promise to the workers salaries they have never dared to dream of, but we will also heighten the price of all necessities, so much so that our profits will be even greater.     

>""By our jokes and attacks we will render their priests ridiculous and eventually odius, their religion as ridiculous, as odius as their priests. We shall become the masters of their souls. But above all, let us get control of education, of the schools. By them we will spread the ideas that are useful to us, and we will mold the childrens brains as we wish"".

**David Icke** writes, in his book *""The Trigger""* (2019), of the above quotes from Rabbi Rzeichhorn:

>Make of that what you will because I can't prove authenticity, but 

>(a) you have the right to be aware of this information and 

>(b) there can be no doubt as we observe the world that the plans laid out in the Protocols, by the Sabbatian-Frankist Illuminati and attributed to Rabbi Reichhorn have happened or are happening. 

>This is so patently obvious that agents of **Sabbatian-Frankism**, some knowingly, some dupes, have employed the usual fall-back, fit-every-situation technique of condemning as 'antiSemitic' anyone who points this out and asks any questions about the plan described in the Protocols. I am not saying this is all a 'Jewish plot' - I am saying it's a plot by the **Sabbatian-Frankist Death Cult** that hates and despises Jews and Judaism as it hates and despises everyone else, and that this cult is part of the wider global satanic cult that infests every culture, race and country. On Sabbatian-Frankism I am at one with rabbis such as Marvin S. Antelman and many others.

>The Protocols, whatever their origin, have been dismissed as a forgery since [the articles by Irish writer **Philip Graves**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/TheTimes_exposes_TheProtocols_as_a_forgery.jpg/285px-TheTimes_exposes_TheProtocols_as_a_forgery.jpg) in the London Times in 1921 which were also carried by The New York Times. Graves claimed the Protocols resembled a satire on Napoleon III by French lawyer **Maurice Joly** called **Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ('Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu')** published in 1864. This is where the story usually ends. The Protocols were proved to be a forgery in The Times in 1921 - move along now, nothing to see here. 

>There is, however, other background to consider. Phillip Graves was a captain in British Army Intelligence who worked with **'Lawrence of Arabia'**, another British agent, who manipulated Palestinian Arabs to drive out the Ottoman Empire and open the way for the new Israel to hijack their land. Graves' uncle was **Sir Robert Windham Graves**, a British Consul in **Turkey** and financial advisor to the Turkish government who worked for Civil Intelligence in **Cairo, Egypt**.

>The writer of the articles in The Times was connected to British Army Intelligence and there's more. **Peter Grose**, a writer with the **Council on Foreign Relations**, revealed in his 1994 book, **Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles**, that Philip Graves' 'source' for the articles was a 'Russian emigre' provided to him by ... **Allen Dulles**. What a coincidence. Dulles, a Council on Foreign Relations stalwart, later **CIA chief** and instigator of the satanic **MKUltra** mind control horror, 'discovered' his man while stationed at the US Embassy in post-Ottoman Turkey. 

>The end of the Ottoman Muslim empire (brought about by World War I) was crucial to the establishment of Israel because it included Palestine. Peter Grose said The Times extended a 'loan' to the 'emigre' on the understanding that it did not have to be paid back. An Internet commentator said of the Allen Dulles 'scoop': 

>This was quite an accomplishment for a young American embassy employee, to both prove the major anti-Jewish plan for world domination was a forgery as well as unilaterally keeping Lenin out of the United States so he could be transported to Russia to begin the communist revolution. Strange coincidences like this seemed to follow both Dulles brothers during their long careers in 'public service' - or should we say 'serving the Anglo-American interests headquartered in the City of London'. 

>Dulles and dodgy are interchangeable words and Rabbi Antelman said that the Council on Foreign Relations is America's most powerful pro-Israel lobby group and controlled by Sabbatian-Frankists.

>The Times articles that trashed the Protocols were written by a British Army Intelligence operative using an unnamed source provided by the infamous liar and manipulator Allen Dulles and the source secured a loan from the newspaper he would not have to repay. Oh, nothing to question here, then. Now shut up you 'anti-Semite'! 

>**Colin Holmes**, a lecturer in economic history at the UK's Sheffield University, claimed to have identified the Dulles emigre as **Michael Raslovleff**, a 'self-identified anti-Semite', who gave the information to Graves because he didn't want to 'give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been'. Surely having a document circulating that was alleged to be proof of a 'Jewish plot' is what an 'anti-Semite' would want rather than seeking to trash its legitimacy? Anyway, that's some background and people will have to decide what they think. 

–David Icke, ""The Trigger"", 2019

After reading the above from Icke I had renewed interest in the Protocols and started to do a little research. 

Wikipedia is *""certain""* that the Protocols are a ""forgery""; here is what they have to say:

>Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of ""Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu"" (Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu), an 1864 political satire by Maurice Joly; and a chapter from Biarritz, an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist Hermann Goedsche, which had been translated into Russian in 1872.

Interestingly, however, when one looks up **Herman Goedsche** and his book **Biarritz** (again, on wikipedia), one reads:

>In his 1868 book Biarritz, Goedsche plagiarized a book by the French satirist Maurice Joly, The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu

Also *""Dialogue aux enfers...""* itself appears to be somewhat plagiarized:

>Umberto Eco considered that Dialogue in Hell was itself plagiarised in part from a novel by Eugène Sue, *Les Mystères du Peuple.*

Interesting, what is going on here? But let's continue. Wikipedia says:

>Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half

[Australian researcher Peter Myer comments on the above:]

>[“Cohn's (whose research the wikipedia entry makes use of) arithmetic is incorrect. The word-count of the parallel passages from the Protocols as listed by Bernstein, is 4,361, while the word-count of the Protocols is 26, 496. That is, the parallel passages comprise 16.45% of the Protocols; this is substantial, but still less than one sixth of the total.”]

So... where does the rest of the book come from? 

Back to Wikipedia:

>A major source for the Protocols was Der Judenstaat (1896) by Theodor Herzl, which was referred to as Zionist Protocols in its initial French and Russian editions. Paradoxically, early Russian editions of the Protocols assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization.

Stepanov is said to have published the Protocols first around the same time as Herzl's book was published. That's awfully tight timing. 

Curious. 

The wikipedia page makes no mention of the original Philip Stepanov publication, or Stepanov himself (big omission), but the source authors the page quotes from do. Interesting that.

Time to look into this Stepanov character.

No Wikipedia page that I can find.

The first thing I found was this:

>He said that the ""Protocols"" was not Jewish-Masonic but a Zionist document secretly read at the Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897. (This especially is a foolish notion since an **affidavit** written by **Philip Stepanov, the first publisher**, proves that the ""Protocols"" was first brought to Russia two years before that Congress took place.) [source](http://www.marieslibrary.com/PDF_Articles/ProtocolsZion.pdf)

**Two years before!?** How can a book that heavily relies on plagiarizing from a book published in 1897, be published two years before in 1895? 

I went hunting for this affidavit, and found quotes from it in another document. 

A bombshell document... 

...that I shall now quote from extensively (source at the end):

>According to **Philip Stepanov**, formerly Procurator of the Moscow Synod, Chamberlain, and Privy Councillor, a copy of The Protocols was given to him in 1895 by his neighbour **Maj. Alexis Sukhotin**, Marshall of the town of Orel, who had been given his copy by **Mlle Justine Glinka.** (Sworn statement of Philip Stepanov, dated 17 April 1927).

>**Glinka**, the daughter of a Russian general, had been in France since 1884, working for Gen. Orgevskii, secretary to the Minister of the Interior. **Joseph Schorst**, a Jewish member of the **Mizraim Masonic Lodge in Paris**, was in her employ, and offered to obtain a document which became known as **The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion**. Schorst later fled to Egypt where he was murdered. Returning to Russia, she gave a copy of the Protocols to Alexis Sukhotin, who showed it to Stepanov and Professor **Sergius A. Nilus**.

>In wishing to refute the later allegation that The Protocols were formulated at the 1897 First Zionist Congress in Basle, **Herman Bernstein**, an early debunker of The Protocols, cites Stepanov’s sworn statement, the handwritten original being reproduced in **Mrs Leslie Fry’s book Waters Flowing Eastward**. Bernstein states:

>>""…This account of the history of the Protocols in Russia is accompanied by a facsimile affidavit made in 1927 by Philip Stepanov, one of the two friends to whom Sukhotin first showed the Protocols in Russia. Stepanov's telltale affidavit, translated from the Russian, reads as follows: 

>>>""In 1895 my neighboring estate owner in the province of Tula, retired Major Alexey Nikolayevitch Sukhotin, gave me a handwritten copy of the **'Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion.'** He told me that a lady of his acquaintance (he did not mention her name), residing in Paris, had found them at the home of a friend of hers (probably of Jewish origin), and before leaving Paris, had translated them secretly, without his knowledge, and had brought one copy of that translation to Russia, and had given that copy to him, Sukhotin.

>>>""At first I mimeographed one hundred copies of the Protocols, but that edition was difficult to read, and I resolved to have it printed somewhere, without mentioning the time, the city and the printer; I was helped in this by Arcady Ippolitovitch Kelepkovsky, who at that time was Privy Councillor with Grand Duke Sergey Alexandrovitch; he had these documents printed at the Provincial Printing Press; that was in 1897. S. A. Nilus reprinted these Protocols in full in his book, with his own commentaries. 

>>>""Philip Petrovitch Stepanov, former Procurator of the Moscow Synod Office; Chamberlain, Privy Councillor, and at the time of the publication of that edition, Chief of the district railway service of the Moscow-Kursk railway (in Orel). 

>>>""This is the signature of a member of the colony of Russian refugees at Stary and Novy Futog. ""Witnessed by me, Stary Futog, April 17, 1927. ""Chairman of the Administration of the Colony, ""Prince Vladimir Galitzin."" (Seal) 

>–(Herman Bernstein, The Truth About ""The Protocols Of Zion"": A Complete Exposure, 1971, pp. 37-40. Bernstein quotes from L. Fry's book Waters Flowing Eastward).

>...there are internal indications that The Protocols date well prior to 1900-01. For e.g. a reference to ""the Panama scandal"" of 1888 which caused a furore in France during the 1890s. Also had The Protocols been contrived by Golovinsky ca. 1900 (see source below for more info) or at least sometime after 1896, it seems reasonable that anti-Semites would draw widely on references to Zionism, the First Zionist Congress taking place in 1897. However, **there are no references to Zionism** at all in The Protocols. The **initial opinion** of **Nilus** et al that **The Protocols** were **not derived from the Zionist movement**, but from a Jewish faction of **Masonry**, were correct.

>It is particularly interesting that Cohn [*historian Norman Cohn, quoted extensively in the wikipdeia entry*] bases his refutation of The Protocols on the assertion that they are plagiarised from **Maurice Joly’s Dialogues in Hell**, and refutes the notion that The Protocols could emanate from the **Alliance Israelite Universelle**, **yet fails** to make any mention of the close association that existed between the Alliance’s **Adolphe Cremieux** and Joly. After all, most of the publicists for The Protocols seem to have considered the association, but Cohn, eager to nick-pick on various details, neglects refuting these most damning connections. Both Cohn and Bernstein were fully aware of **Joly’s** associations with **Cremieux** and with **Masonry** as stated in **Mrs Fry’s** book **Waters Flowing Eastward** (both mention the book) yet they say nothing of these associations. We must therefore assume that Mrs Fry’s assertions regarding Joly, Masonry and Cremieux are correct.

>Whilst we shall shortly deal with the alleged parallels between passages of The Protocols and Joly’s work, we shall first deal with background of Joly that Cohn, Bernstein et al conspicuously avoid. Joly (1831-1878) had a family background in Masonry from his maternal grandfather. Studying law, he secured a post in he Ministry of the Interior. In 1860 he founded a newspaper, Le Palais, for lawyers and attorneys. The principal stockholders were: Jules Favre (**Mason** who served in the Gambetta Government, the so-called Government of National Defence, which arose after the fall of Napoleon III in 1870), Desmaret (**Mason**), Leblond (**Mason**), **Adolphe Cremieux, Mason and head of the Alliance Israelite Universelle**, a member of the Gambetta Government, of whom more later), Emmanuel Arago, **Mason**, serving with Gambetta), and Antoine Berryer (apparently the only non-Mason around Joly).

>Joly’s politics were self-described as ""socialist"", with the need to accept ""extreme means"". With Cremieux he shared a hatred of Napoleon III. However what The Times, as well as subsequent critics of The Protocols do not mention is that Joly’s polemic against Napoleon III was itself predated by a **similar work** entitled **Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Rousseau,** which was written by **Jacob Venedey** and published in Berlin in **1850**. Therefore, Joly was continuing a certain polemical line of thought rather than inventing it. If there are similarities between Joly and The Protocols, then there are also similarities with Venedey. All three for instance refer to the **Hindu God Vishnu** in parallel passages.

>According to the expert testimony of Col. Fleischhauer at the 1935 Berne Trial, Joly was himself Jewish, his name having been originally **Jo**seph **L**ev**y**, Joly being concocted out of four letters of his true name. This testimony was said to have caused a sensation in the courtroom. When the plaintiffs produced a ""baptismal certificate"" to prove that Joly was not Jewish, it was dated December 1829, i.e. several years prior to Joly’s real date of birth according to his own account.

>Since Venedey, a communist, takes a position antithetical to Joly, his champion being Machiavelli, we can see here a dialectical process in operation, that was brought to revolutionary perfection by Marx and the communists, and has arguably been used by the ‘Elders of Zion’. The dialectical strategy consists of promoting tension in society to achieve change. This includes the promotion of ideas and movements seemingly antithetical to ones own aims in the short term to advance long-range aims. Hence, the seemingly contradictory and self-destructive phenomenon of international bankers financing supposedly anti-capitalist revolutions to bring down traditional societies, as we shall see in due course. That the dialectical process is operative here can be inferred from the fact that Cremieux was the mentor of both Venedey and Joly. Hence the seemingly contradictory, antithetical positions of Venedey and Joly represent two sides of the programme of the ‘Learned Elder’.

>Venedey (1805-1871) was a Jew who sought refuge in France, due to his revolutionary activities in Germany. He was removed from Paris by the police, but was able to return due to the intercession of Arago (whom we have seen was to become a stockholder in Joly’s newspaper) and **Francois Mignet**, both friends of Cremieux. Venedey was closely associated with **Karl Marx** and helped establish the Communist International, and was also active in the Masonic order Bauhutte.

>**Masonry, Illuminati & The Rite of Mizraim**

>Mrs Fry and other authorities on The Protocols have claimed that **the documents were taken from a Lodge of the Masonic Rite of Mizraim**, by one of its Jewish members, Joseph Schorst. Whilst this suggestion is of course rubbished out of hand by Cohn et al, once again the Protocols deniers remain strangely mute as to **the role of both Cremieux and Joly in Mizraim**.

>Cremieux was a prominent member of Mizraim as well as Scottish Rite Masonry and the Grand Orient. Cremieux was a member of the Supreme Council of the Order of Mizraim. He also became Grand Master of the unified Grand Orient and Scottish Rite Masonry.

>The Aegpytian Rite of Mizraim or Misraim was founded in Milan, Italy in 1805 and transferred to France in 1814. **Mizraim is Hebrew for Egypt**. Its origins reach back to the cabalistic magician **Cagliostro**, who was an initiate of the **Illuminati**. But the Misraim-Rite was (and still is) not accepted by Regular Freemasonry.

>In 1862, another irregular rite, the **Memphis Rite** was introduced to the USA. On 4th June 1872, **John Yarker** introduced the Memphis-Rite to England. Under his jurisdiction, Memphis and Misraim came together. This unification was called **The Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Misraim**, or **Memphis-Misraim**. 

>In 1902 **Theodor Reuss**, a German espionage agent, gained sanction from Yarker to install the Scottish Rite (33 degrees) and the ""irregular"" MM-Rites (90 and 97 degrees) in Germany. In 1917, Reuss introduced some of the Scottish Rite and MM degrees into the **Ordo Templi Orientis**, an occult society founded in 1906. This OTO was to be taken over by the infamous ""Black Magician"" and self-declared ""Great Beast 666"", **Aleister Crowley**. Crowley, a cabalist, was to write his own manifesto for a ""New World Order"", which he called The Book of the Law, expounding a Nietzschean doctrine of ""Force and Fire"" on the ruins of Christianity. Crowley saw his movement as being a continuation of the Illuminati and counted its founder Adam Weishaupt among a long list of ""saints"". A major difference of course is that Crowley did not have the resources and influence of Organised Jewry.

>In 1870 the Rite of Mizraim was established in England under the authority of Cremieux. Bro. Little, one of those at the founding conference of Mizraim in London, on 28 December, stated: 

>>""…Brother Cremieux, however, as a proof of his willingness to assist, sent to the meeting his diploma as a member of the French Grand College of Rites, and this diploma was placed upon the table during the proceedings, and was examined by several out of the hundred Masons present. It was also understood that Brother C.'s diploma invested him with the power to found rites or orders recognized by the Grand Orient of France (the Rite of Misraim being one)…""

>The Freemason reported that a 

>>""Supreme Council General of the 90°, had been regularly formed here 'under the authority conveyed in a diploma granted to the Illustrious Brother Cremieux, 33° of the Rite Ecossais, and a member of the Grand College of Rites in France.'""

>Bernstein and Cohn rubbish any such notion of Masonic involvement in any conspiracy, including involvement in the French Revolution. This repudiation is necessary on their part, since **Masonry plays a major factor in the conspiracy expounded in The Protocols**. We shall consider the role of Masonry and the Illuminati in due course. Suffice it here to cite several eminent sources that can hardly be said to be anti-Semitic. **Benjamin Disraeli**, the Jewish Victorian era Prime Minister of Britain and intimate of the **Rothschild** banking dynasty, one of the mainstays of Jewish world influence, states in terms themselves reminiscent of The Protocols:

>>""When the secret societies, in February 1848, surprised Europe, they were themselves surprised by the unexpected opportunity, and so little capable were they of seizing the occasion, that had it not been for the Jews, who of late years unfortunately have been connecting themselves with these unhallowed associations, imbecile as were the governments the uncalled-for outbreak would not have ravaged Europe. But the fiery energy and the teeming resources of the children of Israel maintained for a long time the unnecessary and useless struggle. If the reader throws over the provisional governments of Germany, and Italy, and even of France, formed at that period, he will recognise everywhere the Jewish element. Even the insurrection, and defence, and administration of Venice, which, from the resource of statesmanlike moderation displayed, commanded almost the respect and sympathy of Europe, were accomplished by a Jew - Manini, who by the bye is a Jew who professes the whole of the Jewish religion, and believes in Calvary as well as Sinai, 'a converted Jew', as the Lombards styled him, quite forgetting, in the confusion of their ideas, that it is the Lombards who are the converts - not Manini.""

>Secondly we have a remarkable statement from **Leon Trotsky**, the Jewish revolutionary who became commander of the Red Army and with **Lenin** the most powerful man in the USSR:

>>""It was during that period that I became interested in freemasonry. ... In the eighteenth century freemasonry became expressive of a militant policy of enlightenment, as in the case of the Illuminati, who were the forerunners of the revolution; on its left it culminated in the **Carbonari**. Freemasons counted among their members both **Louis XVI** and the **Dr. Guillotin** who invented the guillotine. In southern Germany freemasonry assumed an openly revolutionary character, whereas at the court of **Catherine the Great** it was a masquerade reflecting the aristocratic and bureaucratic hierarchy. A freemason **Novikov** was exiled to Siberia by a freemason Empress. . I discontinued my work on freemasonry to take up the study of Marxian economics. ... **The work on freemasonry acted as a sort of test for these hypotheses. ... I think this influenced the whole course of my intellectual development**."".

>Note that Trotsky not only refers to Masonry as a major factor in revolutionary ferment, but how it had also infiltrated the hierarchy of the old order it was about to overthrow, and that both the Illuminati and the Italian Carbonari were involved. Yet Bernstein and Cohn dismiss such sentiments when expressed by Robison et al as ""fantasy"". Bernstein also opines that the Illuminati were a ""rival"" of Masonry and did not survive its banning by the Elector of Bavaria. As we shall see, this opinion is naïve at best. 

>Thirdly, **Bernard Lazare** traces the Jewish influence on Masonry and the Illuminati, as follows:

>>""…It is true of course that there were Jews connected with Freemasonry from its birth, students of the Kabbala, as shown by certain rites which survive. It is very probable too that in the years preceding the French Revolution, they entered in greater numbers than ever, into the councils of the secret societies, becoming, indeed, themselves the founders of secret associations. There were Jews in the circle around **Weishaupt**, and a Jew of Portuguese origin, **Martinez de Pasquales**, established numerous groups of Illuminati in France and gathered a large number of disciples, who he instructed in the doctrines of reintegration. The lodges which Martinez founded were mystic in character, whereas the other orders of Freemasonry were, on the whole, rationalistic in their teachings. This might almost lead one to say that the secret societies gave expression in a way to the two fold nature of the Jew, on the one hand a rigid rationalism, on the other that pantheism which… often ended in a sort of Cabalistic theurgy. There would be little difficulty in showing how these two tendencies worked in harmony; how Cazotte, Cagliostro, Martinez [de Pasquales]… were practically in alliance with the Encyclopaedists and the Jacobins, succeeded in arriving at the same end, the undermining, namely, of Christianity.""

>The Protocols (if obtained in 1884) refer to the Panama Canal scandal years before the scandal had become public knowledge (in 1892). Therefore whoever wrote The Protocols must have had inside knowledge of high powered financial manipulation.

>We have already noted that The Protocols did not originate with the Zionist movement. This was the original opinion of Nilus and others, although subsequently modified after Zionism became an influential movement among the Jews. In fact, the majority of the most prominent figures of World Jewry were opposed to Zionism, and some Orthodox Jews are still antagonistic on the basis that Israel was not to be recreated until after the advent of the King-Messiah.

>The principal allegation levelled at the supposed forgers of The Protocols is that the purpose is to foment ""anti-Semitism"". However, the following is a remarkable passage from The Protocols in which it is said that **""anti-Semitism"" serves the purposes of the ""Elders of Zion"" in keeping the Jewish masses herded under their leadership**. 

>As one might say today, this seems to be something of a ""protection racket"". The Jewish masses are being milked of millions of dollars every year to fill the coffers not only of Israel but of numerous ""Jewish defence"" organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League, which continually feed the Jews the line that a pogrom or a new ""Holocaust"" is just around the corner if Jews don’t keep donating. Here is what The Protocols say about ""anti-Semitism"". It is surely a strange passage if the authors are anti-Semites wishing to incite pogroms: 

>""Nowadays if any States raise a protest against us it is only pro forma at our discretion, and by our direction, for their antiSemitism is indispensable to us for the management of our lesser brethren. I will not enter into further explanations, for this matter has formed the subject of repeated discussions amongst us."" (Prot. IX)

There is much, much more to this story; what I have quoted above are **abridged excerpts**.

The full document is a fascinating read and you can read it here:

>""But you yourselves perfectly well know that to produce the possibility of the expression of such wishes by all the nations it is indispensable to trouble in all countries the people's relations with their governments so as to utterly exhaust humanity with dissension, hatred, struggle, envy and even by the use of torture, by starvation, **BY THE INOCULATION OF DISEASES**, by want, so that the goyim see no other issue than to take refuge in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else.

BEYOND COINCIDENCE in my opinion...
What do you guys think? 

*****************
Pizzagate is real.

It isn’t some right wing conspiracy theory. 

It's real. It’s always been real.

If you think the Wayfair bullshit makes you sick, then wait. 

Because what you’re seeing is just a small piece to a HUGE puzzle. 

This runs deep.

People laughed at Pizzagate…. They aren’t laughing anymore.

Human trafficking is real. 

It’s one of the classes you take when you’re fostering/adopting. It’s at least 4 hours. 

Elite pedophilia is real. Organ harvesting is real.

It’s not a new phenomenon. It’s not something that just started. It’s been going on for YEARS.

It’s not something that is just going on in the US. It’s happening all over the world. 

It involves Hollywood. It involves politicians. It involves the Rich. People you look up to are involved.

And I get it. It’s hard to wrap your head around what’s going on. It’s hard to imagine something so dark and disgusting going on right under your nose. 

It’s hard to imagine something so evil is happening to our children.

It’s easy to laugh it off as some conspiracy theory. 

Oh no, not my favorite actor, singer, or politician. Oh no, not Hillary. She can’t be involved. She was going to save us from Trump. 

The international Labor Organization estimates 40.3 MILLION human trafficking victims GLOBALLY.

If you think this is still a hoax or don’t want to come to terms with the fact that an Elite Pedophilia ring exists, ask yourself this:

⭐️Everyone knew about Epstein and his love for underaged girls. 

⭐️People were calling Little Saint James Pedophile Island since Epstein purchased the island in 1998.

⭐️With that knowledge, why did Bill Clinton and Obama visit Epstein’s Island? Multiple times?

⭐️Why did the locals report seeing dozens of young kids being taken across there for years?

⭐️Why was Bill Gates a regular visitor there? 

⭐️Prince Andrew…. Do I need to say more and why is The Queen going around threatening anyone to run the story if it’s not true?

⭐️You mean to tell me that all these prominent men and women went to his island for one big party? Knowing what they knew about him? It wasn’t a secret. 

⭐️What was Epstein using the underground tunnels for?

⭐️Who was Ghislaine Maxwell?

⭐️Did you know she owned a submarine company?

⭐️Did you know she has her sub pilot license?
What could she possibly need a submarine pilot license for?

⭐️Did you know the TerraMar project was founded by Clinton Foundation and was located in the Lynn De Rothschild property in Manhattan?

⭐️Chelsea Clinton and Ghislaine are reported to be very close and actually vacationed together. You mean to tell me that Chelsea didn’t know about Ghislaine?

⭐️Remember when Chelsea’s wedding was paid for with money that was supposed to feed starving Haitian children?

⭐️Why did Hillary put Ghislain’s nephew in charge of key Middle East policy decisions when she ran the State Department? You know… the one overseeing US/Libya policy that got an ambassador killed.

⭐️What about the Podesta Emails?

⭐️What was up with John and Tony Podesta’s artwork?

⭐️Would you own any of that creepy shit? 

⭐️Why would Obama buy $65,000 worth of tax payers money to have hot dogs fly in from Chicago for a private party?

⭐️Who the fuck is James Alefantis?

⭐️A pizza restaurant owner in DC? Who happens to be named one of the most powerful people in DC? A pizza place? A man that owns a pizza place? A man that has close ties with the Clintons,Obama, Epstein and many more?

⭐️Have you seen his instagram? Oh you probably haven’t… you’re just now looking into everything. 

⭐️Have you looked up the art that is in his pizza place?

⭐️You want your kids seeing that stuff?

⭐️What about the dark web login to get into his site and order pizza that cost thousands of dollars? Oh wait… that was taken down.

⭐️What is a pizza place owner doing communicating with the White House?

⭐️What about the Hollywood actor that walked into comet pizza and shot at a locked closet door? The same closet that housed his PC? Odd.

⭐️What about Anthony Weiner? All the emails found on his laptop?

⭐️You mean to tell me that his wife, Huma Abedin, had no knowledge of what was going on? 

⭐️Huma and her friend Hillary had NO clue about this 15 year old girl?

⭐️What about the folder titled “Life Insurance”?

⭐️You know the one that housed Frazzledrip with Huma and Hillary.

⭐️The same Huma and Hillary who 9 NYPD have “committed” suicide after watching a horrific video of them doing unspeakable things to little girl? The same NYPD who threw up because what they saw was horrific? 

⭐️Speaking of suicide, why has 57 people who were former colleagues and associated ended up dead in the past 30 years? 15 have died of suicide. 8 died in a plane, car, or motorcycle accident and 14 have been found mysteriously murdered. All of these people had info that could have potentially hurt the clintons career. I don’t even have 57 friends 😂😂 let alone know 57 people that I need to add to a hit list. 

⭐️Why is James Comey’s daughter is lead prosecutor on the Epstein sex trafficking case?

⭐️Former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao admitted they Knew Ghislaine supplied underage girls for Epstein and his pedo buddies?

⭐️The Norwegian Royal Family implicated in Epstein Scandal? Why? Not surprising considering Prince Andrew.

⭐️What about Oprah’s mentor? John of God and Weinstein. You mean to tell me Oprah didn’t know? Come on nowwwwwwww.

⭐️Have you even heard of the NXIVM case? They were just running a sex cult where Smallville actress, Allison Mack were arrested and indicted on federal charges related to sex trafficking.

⭐️What about Laura Silsby? The woman who was tried in Haiti for trying to sneak and KIDNAP 30 children to bring them to the US. Clinton’s used executive order to bring her back without being charged.

⭐️The kicker…… guess who changed their legal name and is in charge of amber alert? Holy fucking shit…  Laura Silsby… but let’s not mention that…. People who dig down that hole end up dying….

⭐️The McMartin Preschool. The Franklin Coverup. Seth Rich. Isaac Kappy. Boystown. The Finders. 

⭐️Denish Hastert…. Do you know him? You should. Good buddies with Podesta….

⭐️Robert Menendez. Mike Folmer. Prominent democratic donor, Terry Bean. David Byrd. George Byrd. All known prominent pedophiles. 

This doesn’t even cover a quarter of what is going on. This is so much more than Epstein. It’s so much more than Ghislaine. This runs deep and you’re going to be shocked at the ending.

Everything. Everything ties together. Everything is connected. 

So while others are more concerned about COVID, I’m more concerned about saving our children. Aren't you?

125,How a US Senator & the reddit admins conspired to remove the top mod of /r/conspiracy and sabotage the sub,286.0,lyu2cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lyu2cz/how_a_us_senator_the_reddit_admins_conspired_to/,465.0,1615005223.0,"The obvious conspiracies are often the most overlooked, especially when they hit close to home.

I've been here long enough to remember [that reddit was *birthed* in conspiracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/87/the_downing_street_memo/). 

[I shared my suspicions about the death of Barry Jennings](https://old.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/71ywu/another_key_witness_of_wtc7_bombings_barry/) back in 2008. There was no /r/conspiracy yet, so I used /r/wtf. Hard to imagine a 9/11 conspiracy theory getting upvoted on ""mainstream"" reddit! 9/11 woke me up, and I've been a conspiracy theorist ever since.

My research has introduced me to some really interesting characters. [Here's a thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ijsiid/ive_been_sharing_conspiracies_on_reddit_longer/) about two guys I know who might be some of the prototypes of the characters we call ""Snowden"" and ""Assange."" 

I met ""Axo"" once, in 2010. We were at a private gathering comprised of hackers and other digital malcontents. A few of us were active on reddit, and we talked a lot about the fledgling /r/conspiracy sub. I remember discussing 9000sins and some of the other OG mods.

Axo was open about his reddit handle. He said he wanted to use it to explore some of the ""fringe"" stuff he was obsessing with. I remember he was very keen on talking about (and doing) DMT, and hypothesizing about ancient civilizations too.

I might have even planted a seed of vaccine skepticism, a subject that would become one of his main focuses on reddit. I talked to him about ""Dr. Mary's Monkey"", the contamination of the polio vaccine and the connection to JFK's assassination, subjects that were *my* main focus at the time. I was happy to see him slowly shift his efforts toward vaccines and the Big Pharma conspiracy.

Over the next few years, he became one of the most prolific contributors on /r/conspiracy. People forget that Axo had some of the best OC on the sub. That's how he became a mod. I supported his election as mod. I remember when he was enthusiastically voted in by the community here. But I *did* have concerns the new duties would distract from his own personal research.

**And then something happened**

That ""something"" was the election of Trump in 2016. It upended a lot. Something was activated, and it was targeted directly at us, the conspiracy theorists. 

I started figuring that out when a bunch of normies I knew reached out to me (I'm the ""conspiracy"" guy after all) flipping out about the ""pee pee tape"" and how Russia was taking over, yadda yadda.

These were the people that I had spent the last 15 years trying to wake up to the corruption of our government. Now they were babbling off the deep end with NO evidence, parroting blatant MSM propaganda! That's when I knew we were in trouble.

/r/conspiracy generally stayed skeptical of ""muh russia"" while the rest of reddit turned into crazy conspiracy theorists! The narrative pushers were just plain mad the real conspiracy theorists didn't buy their russia fairy tale They were especially angry at /r/conspiracy for daring to flair their ravings with ""unverified allegations"", if you remember that!

Axo became one of the main targets of this Herculean anti-conspiracy assault. This was a little strange because I saw him regularly denounce Trump, especially over the illegal drone strikes and military attacks, and eventually the response to COVID and the vaccine (which Axo said was a hoax early on...ngl, I was fooled by COVID for a hot minute). One thing was clear:

**There was a coordinated attempt between the admin team and FUD subs like TMOR to de-legitimize and neuter /r/conspiracy, including a harassment campaign against the mod team that lasted years.**

Axo said he was one of the most targeted accounts on reddit. I found these by searching this sub for ""TMOR harassment"":

[(More) Proof of Targeted Harassment and Vote Manipulation on /r/conspiracy Originating from /r/TopMindsOfReddit (TMOR)](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/86t042/more_proof_of_targeted_harassment_and_vote/)

[Collection of abusive threads and targeted harassment from ""Top Minds of Reddit""](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2uhi3/collection_of_abusive_threads_and_targeted/)

My guess is at first the admins didn't really care. They had the old top mod ""illuminatedwax"" as a fail safe, and Axo generated revenue (with awards etc). After all, /r/conspiracy is probably a honeypot/containment sub. As long as the ""crazy"" didn't spread across reddit, the admins tolerated it, and Axo too.

Folks remember illuminatedwax, right? He was the creator of /r/conspiracy, but he became increasingly afk over the years, and was accused of being a power user who was squatting on the top position of multiple subs.

**The first major attempt by the admin team to sabotage /r/conspiracy was the messy removal of illuminatedwax.**

Folks remember *that*, right? [Here's the thread from Axo detailing what went down](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9iir3b/announcement_final_update_on_the_removal_of/) (search for ""illuminatedwax"" on this sub for more info). To summarize:

1. Mods can request the removal of an idle ""top"" moderator. They have to demonstrate the top mod is MIA and show the team has reached a consensus in nominating a successor.

2. The /r/conspiracy mod team apparently spent a lot of time and effort petitioning the admins to remove the idle (and increasingly suspicious) illuminatedwax account. The admins dragged their feet for a weirdly long time.

3. Finally the admins said the removal had been approved, and Axo was instructed to submit a ""subreddit request"" to remove illuminatedwax.

4. WHOOPS! According to the admins, a ""bug"" resulted in the deletion of the ENTIRE /r/conspiracy mod team, and the reinstatement of Axo as the *sole* mod of the sub. Axo quickly invited back the mods that were active at the time, but the damage was done. 

5. The optics were bad, and TMOR, SRD and /r/drama jumped on it. According to them, Axo had attempted a ""coup"" of the sub. In addition, the entire mod team had their ""counters"" reset back to zero, punishing all of the veteran mods.

The narrative quickly became: Axo was a tyrant who had taken control of /r/conspiracy.

Axo wasn't dumb, like most mods he spent his time removing TOS violations for reddit. He wasn't about to lose his position and account by committing these violations himself (I hope not, at least...we don't know what *actually* led to his ban, because the admins didn't say). 

They couldn't take him down over his *content*, instead they had to harass and threaten him incessantly. [It's no secret that Axo received threats constantly.](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/c7ze53/psa_i_regularly_receive_death_threats_and_other/) I can only imagine this contributed to his ban. The admins probably were tired of dealing with the sheer amount of TOS violations directed *at* Axo!

This was part of the narrative they needed that Axo abused his position. For years they constantly flooded Axo's threads with rule violations and straight up harassment, compelling him to use his mod powers to prevent these threads from being overrun.

I even experienced a spillover effect of this crazy hatred myself just last month. I shared some links on /r/conspiracy that I saw over at conspiracies.win, and I quickly found myself being accused of being an Axo alt. Judging by the small sample of threatening PMs I received when they ""found"" Axo again, I can only imagine what he put up with.

TMOR accused me of using a bot that mirrored Axo's threads to repost *my* account. Well the bot isn't mine. It's run by the user ""f_k_a_g_n"" who tracks activity on /r/conspiracy. You'll have to ask him why he chose to track me too.

Speaking of alts, it was a rite of passage for the TMOR troglodytes to create as many alts as possible to be banned by Axo at /r/conspiracy. After his permanent suspension, I saw some of them gloating they had 30+ alts banned by the ""tyrant"" himself. Of course, this admission pretty much *vindicates* Axo more than anything else!

The narrative was that Axo banned ""hundreds of genuine users""...not that he banned the SAME handful of TMOR alt accounts again and again. Did some real folks get caught in the crossfire? I'm sure. But I'm glad Axo tried to stop /r/conspiracy from turning into the same echo chamber as the rest of reddit, even if it was at the cost of creating a smaller echo chamber. Lesser of two evils, maybe?

People had to be convinced that Axo was a monster so there would be minimal resistance when he was eventually removed. That way /r/conspiracy could more easily be absorbed into the rest of reddit. 

Reddit in 2021 won't tolerate someone like Axo at the helm of a large sub, even a ""controversial"" sub like /r/conspiracy. Look what the admins JUST did with mod ""zjz"" over at /r/wallstreetbets who was removed in a coup and not allowed to return to the team.

**That brings us to the 2020 election**

The fix was in when Axo was given a 7-day suspension one day *before* the election in November. Let's rephrase that:

**The head moderator of the largest conspiracy forum on the web was given an unexplained suspension one day BEFORE the biggest election conspiracy in recent history.**

I hadn't really been on /r/conspiracy for months, but naturally I *immediately* visited the sub the day after the election. I saw Trump way ahead on election night, I watched him give a speech warning about 3AM ballot drops, and I stayed up and watched them happen live! I've never seen a more obvious conspiracy unfold in my life, and I lived through 9/11.

I noticed something was off almost immediately after visiting /r/conspiracy. There was a pinned thread warning that the reddit admins were outlawing unsourced claims of ""election fraud"" (whatever THAT meant), and the first thing I noticed was that it wasn't written by Axo. I would've expected an announcement of that caliber would come from the head mod.

Plus, the threads were *out of control*. It's normal for the occasional thread to get hit with a ""where's the conspiracy?"" or the usual meta attacks against conspiracy theorists (mostly Rule 2 violations). But in the days following the 2020 election, /r/conspiracy *was overrun* with this activity. I remember thinking, ""where the FUCK are the mods?"" and getting frustrated that the mod log was down (it still is, apparently).

At one point I checked on Axo's account and saw he hadn't posted in a few days. I thought that was weird considering everything that was happening (I didn't realize he was suspended). But when I saw Axo post on Voat (RIP) a few days later that he had been given a 7-day suspension on reddit one day *before* the election with NO explanation, I knew something was whack. 

I realized that Axo was a major force in modding the rule 2 violations that are the favorite forum sliding tactic of the TuMORs. This was confirmed a week later when Axo came back and this behavior was somewhat curtailed. I hope other folks were around then that noticed this shift in tone too.

When Axo returned things started to calm down a little. He soon began to pin election fraud hearing threads, and at a time when the topic was among the most censored on the web.

While TMOR concluded that Axo had gone ""full Trumpet"", I saw something different. Axo saw what *I* saw: we were living through one of the biggest conspiracies of our time (COVID/Great Reset/2020 election), and it was literally the *duty* of the conspiracy theorist to talk about this stuff as much as possible! It's no wonder why there was a flood of comments chanting ""bring back aliens and bigfoot!"" at the time.

I suspect the admins temporarily suspended Axo on the eve of the election largely because it would handicap the discourse on /r/conspiracy in the immediate aftermath. That's when structured and focused conversation was needed the most. /r/conspiracy was the one big sub left on reddit still dedicated to ""controversial"" stuff. 

Would Axo have put up more of a resistance to the ""sources only"" demand by the admins than was shown by the rest of the /r/conspiracy mod team? It's hard to imagine a conspiracy forum unironically being told NOT to speculate about conspiracies.

*What does this imply?*

**The admins knew a conspiracy was underway in the 2020 election, and the head moderator of /r/conspiracy was targeted in advance for suspension and eventual removal to muddy the waters.**

Here's the thing that TMOR doesn't get: Axo wasn't targeted because he was a *Trump* supporter or ""anti-semite"" or whatever, he was targeted for being an *actual conspiracy theorist* running an influential conspiracy forum on a major ""mainstream"" website. This is super obvious when you look at what's unfolded over the last couple months. 

**Italygate**

Axo was effective at focusing attention on unpacking the 2020 election conspiracy, and this culminated in the stickying of the Italygate thread.

[Axo claimed](https://conspiracies.win/p/11RhKDYFUp/i-may-have-been-banned-from-redd/c/) multiple times [that his Italygate thread](https://conspiracies.win/p/11S0NfQKCU/my-response-to-the-daily-dot-giz/c/) was the *prime* reason [he was removed and banned](https://conspiracies.win/p/12hRLZfaL4/a-senator-complained-about-reddi/c/). I respectfully disagree.

TBH, I think ""Italygate"" is a red herring. It could be based on some truths, and maybe some damning ones, but like most of the 2020 election ""conspiracies"" (the Kraken, Hammer/Scorecard, watermarks on ballots, etc) it's ultimately not ""the"" solution.

That being said, whoa boy that ""Italygate"" thread Axo pinned ruffled some feathers! Right before his ban, [Axo noted that the voting in that thread was the strangest he had seen on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ksfsi8/the_voting_comments_and_awards_on_the_pinned/). He believes it lead to ""reddit conspiracies"" being complained about in Congress and his subsequent ban. I think he's got a case.

**Theory: Reddit admins coordinated with the team of a US Senator to neutralize /r/conspiracy**

Axo believes [this footage from the Senate got him banned from reddit](https://conspiracies.win/p/11RhOrwR07/this-footage-from-the-senate-got/c/). On the evening of January 6, Axo pinned a thread of the discussion in Congress that occurred in the aftermath of the ""attack"" on the Capitol.

I was watching live when Senator Tammy Duckworth complained that ""reddit conspiracies"" led to the unrest that day (LMAO). I saw in the /r/conspiracy chat when folks collectively went ""whelp, we're fucked."" I also thought in that moment, incorrectly, that /r/conspiracy would be banned within the week.

At first I was doubtful that Axo was specifically called out by that Senator. However, it's been 2 months and /r/conspiracy is still around!

The goal of complaining about ""reddit conspiracies"" in Congress was clearly *not* the removal of the reddit conspiracy sub! It was the removal of **Axo** and the general neutering of the sub that followed. 

This wasn't necessarily about Axo *himself*, but his insistence upon keeping /r/conspiracy independent from the rest of reddit, a cardinal sin in the eyes of reddit inc. It's the same reasoning the admins used for removing the ""unpredictable"" mods of /r/wallstreetbets that actually were the heart of that sub.

Here are some examples of MSM propaganda that generated the required PR that the admins had ""done something"" about the ""problem"" of conspiracies on reddit, first from the Daily Dot:

>[Reddit bans mod of r/conspiracy after years of anti-Semitism accusations](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/r-conspiracy-axolotl-peyotl-banned-reddit/): The subreddit has devolved into pro-Trump, anti-vax content under Axolotl_Peyotl

And from Gizmodo:

>[Reddit Bans r/Conspiracy Moderator and r/DonaldTrump](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-bans-r-conspiracy-moderator-and-r-donaldtrump-1846021265)

The Daily Dot article even references this TMOR fever dream from 2018:

>[Reddit’s conspiracy subreddit is owned by the alt-right](https://thisinterestsme.com/r-conspiracy-reddit/)

This third piece is a hoot and a half, and it's priceless to see it cited by an MSM article! Of all the attempts to slander the /r/conspiracy mod team, the claims against Axo have aged the worst. This is the first ""complaint"" about Axo:

>axolotl_peyotl believes that the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory is propaganda and that the CIA and the mainstream media have successfully weaponized an ‘irrational fear and hatred’ of Donald Trump in the hopes of galvanizing support for a coup and subsequent police state.

LMAO I love how this pretty much grants Axo Nostradamus-like abilities in one sentence. It continues by accusing him of pushing Q (he wasn't, I think) and essentially being a Russian agent.

Considering how embarrassing the Russiagate narrative appears today in retrospect, it warms my heart seeing this article referenced by the Daily Dot as being remotely relevant. Also, using a featured documentary from 2014 that was voted by the /r/conspiracy community to call Axo ""anti-semitic"" is rich! 

But remember, this is brought to you by the same people who actually believe that Trump saying to ""peacefully make your voices heard"" equates with inciting an ""armed insurrection."" Notice the amusing parallel between ""at least Trump's mean tweets are gone"" and ""at least that meanie Axo is gone.""

**VICE** of all places had [*favorably* portrayed Axo as recently as May 2020](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ep4dan/ufo-subreddit-was-subject-to-systemic-censorship) when he stepped in to fix a weird censorship thing happening on the mod team at /r/ufos. SHH don't tell Vice they said nice things about a notorious ""anti-semite and anti-vaxxer"" lol.

So, what reddit conspiracies and election ""misinformation"" could that sitting Senator *possibly* have been referring to...other than /r/conspiracy and the repeated pinning of election fraud hearings by the top mod Axo? These headlines pretty much confirm that Axo was one of the primary targets of calling out ""reddit conspiracies"" in such a public way.

The admins were able to say ""hey look, we did something about the reddit conspiracy problem!"" Funny how they then pretended to be the good guys in the /r/wallstreetbets/GME fiasco too.

[Axo's final sticky, Italygate](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/krozz6/italygate_obama_and_renzi_former_pm_of_italy/), coincided with sworn affidavits that were allegedly **delivered to Congress** detailing Italygate on that fateful day in January. After his ban, the Italygate sticky was removed.

Here's the rub: **Axo received his permanent suspension HOURS after Senator Duckworth complained about ""reddit conspiracies"" in Congress.**

The cacophonous glee from TMOR/SRD at Axo's removal was predictable. But it was bizarre to see what looked like a lack of awareness from the broader /r/conspiracy community as to what actually went down. I almost made a thread about it at the time, but I got distracted when literally half the internet was banned soon after. Here I am now.

Axo's final post was warning of a coming ""Night of the Digital Long Knives."" He claimed this phrase was used by the admins as an example of a ""call to violence"" that led to his ban. 

Within days after this warning, Trump was banned from Twitter, and the Digital Long Knives really began in earnest. I know Axo has been credited with accurate predictions before (like calling the Boston Bombing and the Notre Dame fire before they happened), but maybe this was too on the nose even for the admins!

After his ban, the narrative pushers were activated. They had spent years building up to this moment. After all, the removal of Axo was only part of the plan. Another part was the pushing of a phony narrative that this was an acceptable and justifiable decision, because Axo was ""mean"" (by banning the shills?).

Since they couldn't get Axo on TOS violations, they had to harass him endlessly instead. This forced him to ban the repeat offenders, who could then claim he was ""abusing"" his mod power and therefore unfit for the position. 

Even more strangely, Axo appears to have been *unbanned* by the admins a few days after his alleged ""permament"" suspension, only to be promptly *rebanned*. The schizophrenic nature of the admins is surely reaching a fever pitch lol.

The /r/conspiracy community and mod team kinda dropped the ball here. Granted, mod AssuredlyaThrowaway composed a nice parting note, but the thread was stickied and allowed to be overrun by the same forces that exist to harass and intimidate the /r/conspiracy community.

Where were the other mods standing up for Axo? The /r/conspiracy veterans? From an outsider's perspective, the dude worked for years as your PR person and main driving force.

I would think Axo knew what he was getting into, and I'm pretty sure he saw it coming (probably why he got conspiracies.win up and running), but the irony is wild. He posted receipts of the regular threats and harassment leveled at him on reddit, and he *still* continued working for reddit inc. In some ways, he got what he deserved, and I say that with all due respect!

**...and that Senator**

WTF was that really about? She doesn't know what reddit even is! She's a boomer. Thedonald had been neutralized and moved off reddit (to .win) years earlier. This was a line fed to her by her own team (or someone else) for a specific purpose. For the reddit admins it killed two birds: 

1. it allowed them to generate headlines that they had ""done something"" against election disinformation by neutralizing /r/conspiracy and removing /r/donaldtrump.
 
2. it *finally* allowed them to complete the coup against /r/conspiracy and Axo that began when they first sabotaged the mod team during the replacement of illuminatedwax.

The extraordinary timing of Axo's removal would've been more heavily scrutinized and noteworthy were it not overshadowed by the subsequent banning of half of the internet. The story behind his removal was largely lost in the fray, and honestly /r/conspiracy may have been mortally wounded as a result. At the very least we need a sober reevaluation of what went down here, and especially avoid the same obnoxious emotional rhetoric. 

One thing seems evident: *Axo's ban was the canary in the coal mine for the Great Censoring of early 2021.*

**TO CONCLUDE**

Here are the main reasons why I believe Axo was removed and banned:

* Axo was actually just some guy who likes conspiracy theories, and therefore not subject to the same normie propaganda infiltrating the rest of reddit

* Axo kept /r/conspiracy ""fringe"" and interesting. He arranged many of the AMAs, started the Round Table discussions, maintained regular featured documentaries, updated the sidebar with topical conspiracy images, and **posted a monthly Transparency Report documenting removals on /r/conspiracy by Anti-Evil Operations (the admins)**

* Axo generated countless TOS violations directed *against* his account, likely becoming a headache for the admins

* Axo started conspiracies.win, which probably was considered threatening to reddit inc.

* Axo was regularly pinning election conspiracies like Italygate

And today? The week following the 2020 election during Axo's first suspension was a preview of what was to come for this sub. 

Today the front page of /r/conspiracy is full of comments deriding conspiracy theorists and breaking multiple rules...the very comments that Axo routinely curated.

For two months there's been near radio silence from the /r/conspiracy mod team, except for a few month-long stickies reminding us not to be mean to Hunter Biden, or that same inaccurate Gary Webb meme the shills always post to distract us from current happenings. 

**Where are the calls for renewed Round Table discussions? For an actual image on the sidebar? For future AMAs? For a relevant and stimulating stickied thread? For renewed Featured Documentaries? For a working mod log? For monthly Anti-Evil transparency reports?**

Did these *all* go away with Axo? Did /r/conspiracy lose its greatest advocate, and then collectively shrug its shoulders? If so, it really is a shame.

DISCLAIMER: All of this is just my opinion. I felt it was important enough to share, but I'm admittedly biased towards a conspiracy theorist's perspective. Also, many of the citations are from Axo himself, so this is definitely infused with *his* bias too. I'm not sure what's true, but hopefully whatever truth is contained here will speak for itself!

***The US dollar is about to implode supernova style.. As the US is the current global hegemon, the only way it can get out from under its own petrodollar hegemony FIRST without attracting the wrong kind of attention and setting off global panic of selling dollars is to invent a global distraction (CIA releases COVID) and then follow it up with global chaos (Afghan, Taiwan, HK, SCS, etc) to give the pretext justification for printing like there is no tomorrow, in order to get out from the dollar leaving the rest of the world holding the bag.... and furthermore by destabilizing the world through engineered chaos the US is inducing artificial global demand destruction to price most of the world out so that it can print to infinity with unlimited ""quantitative-easings"" to buy up everything with essentially free money.***

***Since global energy peaked back in 2019 (of all total energy sources, not just oil etc) the US elites realized the inflection point had been crossed and that from hereon out the rate-limiting factor is that of resource capture and remaining energy reserves and not that of abundance of cheap human labor or population growth anymore... this explains America's sudden repudiation of the so-called global order that it lead since WWII and why the US turned its back on globalization all of a sudden...***

***Having seen the writing on the wall (see REPO mess) America's strategy is to exit the dollar and leave the rest of the world, including China to be holding the proverbial bag of excrement, and its intentional COVID failure, and Afghan failures are all part of its pre-planned exit strategy to create global chaos and induce artificial-demand-destruction on global scale in order to best position itself for the coming times and shore up and consolidate its own positions at the direct expense of harvesting the rest of the world by means of infinite quantitative easing through weaponization of its petrodollar hegemony and global reserve currency status***

=====

In summary, once America (the current global hegemon) saw that dual-prong **""*****points of inflections*****"" were being crossed** ( #1 China gaining up and soon surpassing USA, and #2 that of the global peak of total energy production in 2019) the US strategy abruptly shifted to that of Scorched-earth containment of peer or near-peer competitors (China/Russia) whilsts simultaneously applying at the base-level one largest big-picture broad-categorical-stroke of the brush of ""artificial global demand destruction"" (via COVID aka **CIA biovirus and variants** and other forms of **engineered chaos worldwide** )

[https://archive.org/details/peak-oil](https://archive.org/details/peak-oil)

CIA is conning the world yet once again with its **Fifth generation information warfare propaganda** disinfo cyberops and pyscops etc… basically the only reason Afghan went to shit freefall style is the same reason WTC7 collapsed and in both cases it had nothing to do with men in caves… America is playing its version of 5D Chess against China and against the world and its hoax weakness is probably just sandbagging... for the purposes of misdirection and distraction.

[https://pastebin.com/xcxBcRvZ](https://pastebin.com/xcxBcRvZ)

COVID and now this Afghan collapse is all staged to help US consolidate its position both abroad and domestically for the coming WWIII or whatever label you want to put on this thing… some call it the Great Reset, others name it **America's Final Great Harvest of the world** etc...

Because we have past the peak of global energy production in late 2019 (coincidentally that is when the REPO mess started and soon after the vaping incident and then COVID etc) money is about to become worthless…

[https://cryptome.org/2020/02/CIA-biovirus-2019.pdf](https://cryptome.org/2020/02/CIA-biovirus-2019.pdf)

The US elites knows this reality and sees the writing on the wall so the CIA biovirus was really just the false flag pretext needed for the justification of the many rounds of stimulus and giving America the opening/excuse to print nearly 50% of all dollars in its entire 200+ some odd years of history in merely the last year or so etc… without drawing the attention it otherwise would have (that the jig is up, so to speak) when it can conveniently pin it on China and blame it on the “shutdowns” etc… America is printing like there is no tomorrow precisely because it knows there isn’t… this is the smart move to get out from under and let the rest of the world’s vassals, suckers and iSheeples alike HODL the bag of excrement while the US gets out of its own position! Likewise, Bitcoin was always a CIA controlled-opposition project for exactly the same purposes!

From big picture perspective the rate limiting factor is now raw resources, energy, etc and not that of human labor or workers… (even more true in the age of AI and automation…) and **the US elites know that to preserve itself it must cannibalize the rest of the world** since as the global hegemon it is not immune to the fact that globally its now not only zero sum but the pie is actually ever shrinking from here on out…. COVID was merely the final act and opening salvos of\[b\] America’s “Great Harvesting” of the world… **the idea is to induce an artificial global demand-destruction by way of biovirus and engineered chaos** (Afghan, Beirut, HK, Tiawan, XinJiang, etc) in order to price out much of the rest of the world whilsts simultaneously printing to infinity via unlimited Quantitative Easing to buy up real assets, resources, etc before the rest of the world even realizes what the hell happened…

McDaniel is so worked up because Awan allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment from House offices and even allegedly funneled sensitive congressional data offsite in what some are calling a **massive cyber-security breach.**

Last Sunday The Daily Caller reported that the **FBI seized smashed hard drives from Awan’s home. Awan has worked for more than a dozen House Democrats. When allegations began to surface, some Democrats fired Awan but Rep. Wasserman Schultz kept him on staff.**

With this post I want to further flesh out my trail of thought and I believe this subreddit would be the best place to do so.

Before we begin, however, a small disclaimer: this is all speculation and conjecture and is the result of a thought experiment in the mind of a sovereign individual who enjoys to think, question and postulate hypotheses. I cannot prove any of it, so read it as you would read fiction.

Now, on with it:

#The vaccine in of itself is not the endgame

But it provides a framework and foundation for a method of mass population control. A trail of thought:

##Service Access Control

Ticketmaster plans to prohibit anyone from attending events without a negative test result in the past 24-72 hours. Many details of the plan, which is still in development phase, will rely on three separate components -- the Ticketmaster digital ticket app, third party health information companies like CLEAR Health Pass or IBM's Digital Health Pass and testing and vaccine distribution providers like Labcorp and the CVS Minute Clinic. (source: https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan/)

On the surface of it, to prevent the spread of the virus at mass gatherings, this does appear to be a reasonable, simple and understandable logic. Most people won't think twice and just accept it because it makes sense because it makes sense in stopping the spread of the virus.

Members of the US president elect's COVID task force suggests to bundle services that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) as a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. This includes but is probably not limited to: food security, rent assistance, free clinic services. (source: https://www.naturalnews.com/files/200709-The-Publics-Role-in-COVID-19-Vaccination.pdf)

Now as we've already been conditioned to _""wear a mask""_, _""keep your distance""_ and _""wash your hands""_ notifications before entry anywhere, it's not such big a leap to _""proof of vaccine or no admittance""_ signs popping up everywhere. This will effectively require you to prove you've been vaccinated in order to attend events, access medical care, buy groceries, cross a border, ...

(Note: this does not require the virus itself to be a hoax, but we _are_ conditioned to the masks and the overall literature depicting and delimiting appropriate behavior required to access services)

Edit: as noted by Coches in the comments below, Slovakia has begun blanket testing and implementing harsh restrictions similar to house arrest for those that do not comply with voluntary testing (source: https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/europe/slovakia-mass-coronavirus-test-intl/index.html) 

##ID2020

Now that the general public is primed to accept these measures comes the next question, for those of us that still ask questions, _how_ will we meet these requirements and prove that we've been vaccinated? Now some of us conspiracy theorists suggested the vaccine will contain a micro chip with RFID that can be scanned at checkpoints. While we do have this technology available, our overlords know that we won't accept this _yet_. Instead, it's far easier to use the technology that's already in place en masse. Just look at how Ticketmaster is creating an app to join forces with medical data gathering houses.

We can give everyone who's vaccinated a unique and globally identifiable token in a central government controlled database. You can authenticate on these apps using a government issued token which you receive upon vaccination and then provide the checkpoints with a QR code that validates your vaccination status thus giving you access to these public and private services. Not really that hard nowadays if you know anything of IT.

Anyway, now that we've established identification and verification at various private and public service checkpoints, there's a couple of tangents that seem unrelated to the uninitiated of ""connecting the dots"".

##5G Localization

_""5G spr3ADs CoRonA V1rus!""_ is a false flag conspiracy theory. What I mean by that is that is a theory inserted into the conspiracy community to make us look like dim-witted fools and to ostracize anyone questioning 5G.

In a technologically advance world, we do need such network for all the Internet of Things to communicate efficiently with as little ping as possible. One of the benefits of 5G is that we can pinpoint a device's location to up to decimeter accuracy (source: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/industry-articles/how-will-5g-networks-improve-location-awareness/)

This is great news because we have the ID2020 installed on our smartphones and that means that the authorities can locate any one registered individual to their exact location at all times. Because let's not forget, you can't access any public or private service without proper identification (the vaccination registration database makes sure of that)

Of course, the rural areas will continue to enjoy 4G with it's lesser advanced technology, but you can still be tracked to within a couple of meters of accuracy.

##End-to-End Encryption

The first tangent I want to explore are the global attempts at banning end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication and encrypted data in cloud storage.

In the US, the EARN-IT act attempts to backdoor E2EE, this act is now in the house of representatives (source: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/urgent-earn-it-act-introduced-house-representatives) as well as the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that aims to subvert secure cloud data storage (source: https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/why-lawful-access-encrypted-data-act-threat-your-rights-and-privacy)

Recently, this topic has come up at the EU council as well, weighing the pros and cons of encryption in privacy vs (state) security. It doesn't straightforward suggest to ban or backdoor E2EE, but it does state that _""law enforcement and judicial authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner""_ (source: https://www.statewatch.org/media/1434/eu-council-draft-declaration-against-encryption-12143-20.pdf)

This is the point where I should tell you to read between the lines, but let me spell out my thoughts anyways: **both EU and US are under the control of the same shadow government.**

##Big Data Algorithms

All major social media platforms collect your data and run it through an algorithm to build a profile of you so it can feed you content you are more likely to interact with. TikTok being the latest addition which is currently the third most downloaded non-gaming app of the year (source: https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/)

TikTok has a really good algorithm that gives users the content that they want. So good in fact that the US government threatened to ban the app if it didn't get a piece of the pie (or do you really think it was about the security and privacy of its citizens after proposing two bills that undermine this anyway?)

Extensive data collection + algorithm = digital gold for marketeers and governments alike. That _profile_ that is built with the collected data from social media applications reflects not only your interests commercially but also your political ideologies.

##Quarantine Camps

New Zealand, an example to the entire world in terms of progressiveness, is raising quarantine camps to hold anyone testing positive (even against their will) until they test negative. (source: https://thegreggjarrett.com/new-zealand-announces-quarantine-camps-where-positive-patients-will-be-forcibly-placed/)

This is a precursor to vaccination camps, where we will be culling the population that does not comply with the ""guidelines"" at first and later anyone that can be profiled as a dissident to the New World Order (based on social media big data collection and the compromise of your E2EE private messaging)

If you do not believe people are capable of such atrocities, I suggest you read the Gulag Archipelago, an account of the Communist regime in the USSR of past century. Or do you think we humans have evolved beyond such systemic incarceration? Just look at the war on drugs and how many people are behind bars for what is now being legalized (Cannabis _and_ psychedelics) There's no need for physical torture if they can just lock you up where you can do no harm to ""civilized"" society.

##The Plan

In summary, the population needs to keep its attention focused on elected and fact-checked news outlets in which the authorities will tell you what the narrative is. Keeping you fear-induced and providing you with the deus ex machina solution (a well known marketing strategy, source: https://brenits.com/scare-tactics-in-branding-and-marketing/ and https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/10/fear-based-appeals)

Most people will get their vaccine as such and just like that. Then another portion of the population will get theirs to get access to the services they need. Vaccination camps will be introduced for anyone unwilling to comply.

Because we won't accept RFID chips just yet, we start by introducing the smartphone as the first platform to track your vaccination / compliance status to access services you require.

All of this can be linked to our social media accounts as well as your private communications upon which a profile can be built. Anyone profiled as a threat to the New World Order can have their vaccination status revoked, be located and sent to vaccination camps (remember, their goal is not the vaccination in of itself, that's only the narrative, the reality is to get rid of dissidents)

#The Goal

What's the purpose of all this though? A New World Order? The Great Reset?

The social contract is changing, whether we like it or not. Watch the World Economic Forum's video on the Great Reset (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHRkkeecg7c) and tell me these people aren't bigger than governments.

It's the pandemic now, the climate crisis next. We will police ourselves into ushering in a New World Order. On the one hand I can believe this to bring about a global Utopian society without warring countries, pandemics or climate crises. But ignorance is bliss until you take a closer look at how we get there, there's a shadow that stains the soul of humanity. 

I assure you, the frog never noticed the water heating up until it was boiling. But please, do keep watching television, believe the mainstream narrative, do not question your leaders on the magic picture box for they hold all the answers and the alternative is far uglier.

##Do Not Dispair

On a retrospective note, I do not wish for anyone to become afraid and would like to point to Charlie Chaplin's final speech at the end of The Great Dictator:

>To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

I'm worried about what will come with it.  Obviously they can't just project holograms into the sky, use a frequency that penetrates our hearing/mind and speak to us.  It would have to be much more than that, and I'm positive it WILL be much more than that.

Besides directed energy weapons, we aren't completely aware of every type of weaponry that has grown out of the technology they harnessed back in the 40s.  I mean yeah, we know Tesla had a death beam, could generate earthquakes with a small box using resonant frequencies, and several other things...but with 60+ years since Roswell under the military's belt, you have to know they've got some crazy shit cooked up just going off the fact that they've definitely refined the former mentioned technologies.

I guess what worries me, is how the fuck could we point out it's all a ruse, when they obliterate an entire city?  We will be the ones looking like complete idiots even if we point to all the evidence.  I mean, if they scrambled fighters and tried to shoot the holograms, and the missiles just went straight thru the UFOs, or they can't get a heat signature lock, they can just say their using some alien tech, and nobody would believe it's a hologram at that point.

I guess my point is we are all fucked no matter what, and it worries me, because even pointing out it's completely bullshit, and having the best evidence ever witnessed to mankind, it's going to get us nowhere.

Two formerly prestigious medical journals, *The Lancet*[2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext) and *The New England Journal of Medicine*[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007621) published (and later retracted) studies based on Surgisphere data and co-authored by Sapan Desai.

These studies were the basis for the tremendous amount of propaganda against the drug.

How did these ""gold-standard"" medical publications, supposedly employing rigorous peer review policies, failed to identify obvious red flags. These studies were retracted in only 11 days after a tremendous outcry from medical experts finding a ridiculous number of falsehoods. Such complete retractions, made so quickly, are unprecedented for these journals. [4](https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/)
The studies were conducted under the leadership of Dr. Mandeep Mehra, professor at Harvard [4](https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/, a university who's trustworthiness has been recently tarnished by their collaboration with Jeffery Epstein on projects including medical research.

Surgisphere has not attempted a defense of its data or methodology. Surgisphere omitted hospital names and even country names to make fact-checking impossible [4](https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/), meaning appropriate peer review could not have occurred, and those who co-authored or approved the publishing of these studies were, at best, as negligent as could possibly ever be, all-the-while knowing a mistake would doom thousands or even millions of lives.

The studies were conducted under the leadership of Dr. Mandeep Mehra, professor at Harvard [4](https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/, a university who's trustworthiness has been recently tarnished by their collaboration with Jeffery Epstein on projects including medical research.

Dr. Mehra approved Surgisphere's data despite several health data experts finding it inconceivable such an impossibly huge database could be from a tiny company they had never heard of.[4](https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/)[7](https://archive.is/o8yjX)

Here are some details, that were easily publicly available, about the man and company that Dr. Mehra selected as the data supplier in what was known to be possibly the most important study on the planet:

- The company's ""science editor"" was a full-time science fiction author with a fantasy artist side-gig.

- The ""marketing executive"" was an adult model, events hostess, and actress.

-The company's LinkedIn page listed six employees (down to three as of June 3).

-While claiming to run perhaps the largest and fastest hospital database in the world, it had almost no online engagement, with no tweets between October 2017 and March 2020.

-Until July 1, the contact link on Surgisphere's homepage went to a cryptocurrency site, so there was no way for hospitals to join the database.

-In 2008, Desai started an Indiegogo campaign for a completely ludicrous “next generation human augmentation device that can help you achieve what you never thought was possible”.
[1](https://archive.is/gCd4f)

Dr. Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, now admits that the retracted study was a ""fabrication"" and ""a monumental fraud"".[5](https://archive.is/KNLuS) But the study had other inexcusable flaws as well: the original criticism of the study ""was not that the data came from a Theranos-like company that employs more adult-content models than statisticians, but rather that the data, being observational, required some adjustment to yield strong causal conclusions—and the causal adjustment reported in that article did not seem to be enough.""[6](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/06/15/surgisphere-scandal-legacy-media-lancet-still-dont-get-it/)

More issues I've seen statisticians arguing should have been caught in peer review are available [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/05/25/hydroxychloroquine-update/), [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/05/24/doubts-about-that-article-claiming-that-hydroxychloroquine-chloroquine-is-killing-people/), [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/06/15/surgisphere-scandal-legacy-media-lancet-still-dont-get-it/), and [here](https://twitter.com/jwato_watson/status/1264793409618935809).

Additionally, Dr. Horton deemed that “the data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review” - in fact, if Surgisphere had real data instead of fabricated numbers, they would have been violating privacy laws in many countries, which should have alerted co-authors and peer reviewers that it was impossible Surgisphere had such data.[7](https://archive.is/o8yjX)

That this fraudulent study killed people is inarguable. The death rate spike it caused in Switzerland when dispensing of hydroxychloroquine was suspended in response to this study is [as clear as can be](https://pjmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200713_fs_hcq_preuve_final_f_sw_2.jpg)[8](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/stacey-lennox/2020/07/15/media-should-do-a-mea-culpa-as-french-analysis-offers-a-stunning-observation-about-hydroxychloroquine-use-n643181)

One cannot hardly imagine a more destructive negligence in editing than what occurred under Dr. Horton. His refusal to resign is appalling but unsurprising.

Sapan Desai needs to be locked up and interrogated as part of a thorough investigation into the motives for his depraved atrocity. Why would he fabricate data for such a high profile study that would inevitably, quickly be revealed? He had a career-long record of fraud [9](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/whos-blame-these-three-scientists-are-heart-surgisphere-covid-19-scandal), but what was his angle here?

What was his motive to make hydroxychloroquine look *bad* instead of good? If Harvard professors would take money from Jeffery Epstein to help his interests at the expense of sex trafficking victims, would they accept money from interests that could profit off of drugs that are several orders of magnitude more expensive than hydroxychloroquine?

The same day that *The Lancet* published the hitjob on hydroxychloroquine, *New England Medical Journal* published a [pro-remdesivir study] that found (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764). 

These are the lines of investigation that should have been discussed and investigated in the wake of this terrifying betrayal. But are any of the hundreds of journalists that spewed completely confident and completely wrong conclusions about hydroxychloroquine investigating and discussing the ringleader of deathly hoax that misled them? Have they even determined his whereabouts?

No.

As of 7/26/2020 6:00 GMT, as I probably quixotically try to put this knowledge into a communicable form that might somehow magically help the problem, using the researching and writing skills that seemed like they'd be useful when I was taught them but now seem worryingly close to mere compulsive habit, searching for Sapan Desai in Google News for the last 3 days returns not a single result. [10](https://news.google.com/search?q=Sapan%20Desai%20when%3A3d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)

Searching the last 5 days only returns one result, an article from Debbie Maimon at YatedNe'eman. I've never heard of YatedNe'eman before and it's a very probing and caring piece that explores even more than I have: https://yated.com/public-trust-shaken-by-fraudulent-covid-19-studies/

All other accomplices must be investigated as well.

*Science* reveals some fraud by another hoax co-author, Amit Patel, and casts some skepticism on lead author Mandeep Mehra. [12](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/whos-blame-these-three-scientists-are-heart-surgisphere-covid-19-scandal)

It really blows my mind, hurts my heart, keeps my blood pressure and cortisol levels worryingly high, and makes me very sad that I have to write this essay here... 

I was really into debate in high school and college and was trained in research. I quit debate after having to debate a team that said I should never be allowed to win a debate round because I was ""white"". My coach was supportive of this stuff on the drive to that tournament and after having to endure that hate speech knowing even my coach liked it, I broke down crying realizing how alone I was. Most of my friends from that life became lawyers and I just felt I could be a fabulously clever lawyer except I have a soul that I value too much. A couple years later, a student from my college was shot randomly not far from campus. A newspaper story reported that the grieving father felt not just his own son's death, but the deaths of all the victims of murderers he felt he had knowingly kept free and he swore to never do it again.

At the clinic I work at, attacks on vehicles have led to prescription shipping backlog issues of 3 weeks and growing. Most distressing are the phone calls about patients that have been on vital prescriptions for kidney or liver issues for years with never a hint of any supply issue and now things keep getting worse from FedEx / UPS turnover, and trucking was already the most dangerous job in the US in 2019. Everything is slower now due to pandemic restrictions, every appointment takes longer, we're constantly getting calls from people who want to be new patients and we have to turn them away, as are many others here, because we are bursting at the seams trying to treat the patients we already have. People were very nice at the beginning of lockdown, but now clients that have been nice for years are snapping and coworkers are crying from verbal abuse they can do nothing about.

I'm having terrible sleeping problems as stuff like the above are constantly swirling around my head. I really, for my health, just wanted to come home tonight and completely detox from all of this traumatizing knowledge, play a game and talk with friends, but Sapan Desai kept coming up in my head because his crime was so extremely recent, inarguably true and atrocious, literally global in impact, suggestive of so many further issues, and yet I had seen and heard so very, very little about him... I just wanted to take a peep and see what was going on with him, see if he had been arrested, or was in hiding, or had fled the country, or was unable to be found by journalists or law enforcement...

Then I find out no news purveyor allowed by Google has so much as mentioned his name in three days.

You can still easily end up finding this yet-to-be-retracted USA Today fact check though:

>We find the claim that remdesivir is being promoted over hydroxychloroquine because it is more expensive and, by implication, brings in more profit for the drugmaker to be PARTLY FALSE. The price of 60 cents a pill for hydroxychloroquine cited in the post can be considered generally true. But remdesivir is being promoted not for its price – that is false – but because it is proving more effective. Patients were sickened or died from use of hydroxychloroquine. Further, the price of remdesivir is uncertain because it has not been offered as a treatment for coronavirus beyond the donation its maker, Gilead Sciences, made to the government.

155,Evidence Points to Bitcoin being an NSA-engineered Psyop to roll out One-World Digital Currency,238.0,7mktsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mktsk/evidence_points_to_bitcoin_being_an_nsaengineered/,154.0,1514440968.0,"[Eye](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol2/globalbanking555_01.jpg)

I'm going to assume the readers who make it to this article are well informed enough that I don't have to go into the history of the global money changers and their desire for a one world currency.

 

(If you don't yet understand the goal of the [globalist banking empire](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm) and the coming engineered collapse of the fiat currency system, you're already about 5,000 posts behind the curve.)

With that as a starting point, it's now becoming increasingly evident that [Bitcoin](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#BitCoin) may be a creation of [the NSA](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_nsa.htm) and was rolled out as a ""normalization"" experiment to get the public familiar with digital currency.

 

Once this is established, the world's fiat currencies will be obliterated in an [engineered debt collapse](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#Economic_Collapse) (see below for the sequence of events), then replaced with a government approved cryptocurrency with tracking of all transactions and digital wallets by the world's western governments.

**NSA mathematicians detailed ""digital cash"" two decades ago**

 What evidence supports this notion?

 

First, take a look at this document entitled, ""[How to Make a Mint - The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/how-to-make-a-mint.pdf)"" This document, released in 1997 - yes, ***twenty* years ago** - detailed the overall structure and function of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

 

Who authored the document?

 

Try not to be shocked when you learn it was authored by,

    ""mathematical cryptographers at the National Security Agency's Office of Information Security Research and Technology.""

The NSA, in other words, detailed key elements of Bitcoin long before Bitcoin ever came into existence.

 

Much of the Bitcoin protocol is detailed in this document, including signature authentication techniques, eliminating cryptocoin counterfeits through transaction authentication and several features that support anonymity and untraceability of transactions.

 

The document even outlines the *heightened risk of money laundering* that's easily accomplished with cryptocurrencies. It also describes ""secure hashing"" to be ""both one-way and collision-free.""

 

Although Bitcoin adds mining and a shared, peer-to-peer [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) transaction authentication system to this structure, it's clear that the NSA was researching cryptocurrencies long before everyday users had ever heard of the term.

 

Note, too, that the name of the person credited with founding Bitcoin is **Satoshi Nakamoto**, who is reputed to have [reserved one million Bitcoins for himself](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/).

 

Millions of posts and online threads discuss the possible identity of Satishi Nakamoto, and [some posts even claim the NSA has identified Satoshi](https://bittox.com/2017/09/02/nsa-identified-satoshi-nakamoto/).

 

However, another likely explanation is that *Satoshi Nakamoto* **is the NSA**, which means he is either working for the NSA or is a sock puppet character created by the NSA for the purpose of this whole grand experiment.


**The NSA also wrote the crypto hash used by Bitcoin to secure all transactions**


 On top of the fact that the NSA authored a technical paper on cryptocurrency long before the arrival of Bitcoin, the agency is also *the creator of the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)* hash upon which every Bitcoin transaction in the world depends.

 

As [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2013/09/NSA-backdoor-bitcoin-encryption-sha256-snowden.html) (THN) explains.

    ""The integrity of Bitcoin depends on a hash function called **SHA-256**, which was designed by the NSA and published by the *National Institute for Standards and Technology* ([NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)).""

THN also adds:

    ""If you assume that the NSA did something to SHA-256, which no outside researcher has detected, what you get is the ability, with credible and detectable action, they would be able to forge transactions.

     

    The really scary thing is somebody finds a way to find collisions in SHA-256 really fast without brute-forcing it or using lots of hardware and then they take control of the network.""

Cryptography researcher **Matthew D. Green** of Johns Hopkins University [said](https://motherboard.vice.com/blog/what-do-the-latest-nsa-leaks-mean-for-bitcoin).

 

In other words, if the SHA-256 hash, which was created by the NSA, actually has a backdoor method for cracking the encryption, it would mean the NSA could steal everybody's Bitcoins whenever it wants (call it ""Zero Day."")

 

That same article, written by **Mohit Kumar**, mysteriously concludes,

    ""Even today it's too early to come to conclusions about Bitcoin. Possibly it was designed from day one as a tool to help maintain control of the money supplies of the world.""

And with that statement, Kumar has indeed stumbled upon the bigger goal in all this:

    To seize control over the world money supply as the fiat currency system crumbles and is replaced with a one-world *digital currency controlled by globalists*.



**Think cryptography is bulletproof? Think again…**


 Lest you think that the cryptography of cryptocurrency is secure and bulletproof, consider this article from *The Hacker News*, '[Researchers Crack 1024-bit RSA Encryption in GnuPG Crypto Library](https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/gnupg-libgcrypt-rsa-encryption.html),' which states,

    ""The attack allows an attacker to extract the secret crypto key from a system by analyzing the pattern of memory utilization or the electromagnetic outputs of the device that are emitted during the decryption process.""

Note, importantly, that this is a [1024-bit encryption system](https://www.pcworld.com/article/132184/article.html).

 

The same technique is also said to be able to crack 2048-bit encryption. In fact, encryption layers are cracked on a daily basis by clever hackers.

 

Some of those encryption layers are powering various cryptocurrencies right now. Unless you are an extremely high-level mathematician, there's no way you can know for sure whether any crypto currency is truly non-hackable.

 

In fact, every cryptocurrency becomes **obsolete** with the invention of large-scale [quantum computing](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_quantum.htm#Quantum_Computer).

 

Once China manages to build a working 256-bit quantum computer, it can effectively steal all the Bitcoins in the world (plus steal most national secrets and commit other global mayhem at will).

**Ten steps to crypto-tyranny - The ""big plan"" by the globalists (and how it involves Bitcoin)**

 In summary, here's *one possible plan by the globalists* to seize total control over the world's money supply, savings, taxation and financial transactions while enslaving humanity.

 

And it all starts with Bitcoin...



1.         Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.

         

2.        Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone...?)

         

3.        Initiate a massive, global-scale [false flag operation](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_falseflag.htm) that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames (hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)

         

4.        Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, ""the Russians,"" Little Green Men or whatever it takes…)

         

5.        Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate.

         

6.        With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.

         

7.        [Outlaw cash](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#Cashless_Society) and *criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens*. All in the name of ""security,"" of course.

         

8.        Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been ""funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.""

         

9.        Require [embedded RFID](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/secret_projects/implants.htm#RFID) or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to ""authenticate"" the one-world digital crypto currency activities. *Mark of the Beast* becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.

         

10.        Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of ""automated taxation."" In an emergency, the government can even announce *negative interest rates* where your holdings automatically decrease each day.

 

With all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial ""blackouts"" for those individuals who criticize the government.

 

They can put in place **automatic deductions** for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy.

 

With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their ""money"" by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.

 

How do you feel about your Bitcoin now...?

I think its a distraction made by either google or youtube to deflect/confuse the public from the negative attention it got after a youtuber exposed a flaw in YT's algorithm that peodophiles are using YT as a way to traffic and sexualize videos of kids. #youtubewakeup

The coincidence or convenience of this momo issue that suddenly came out of nowhere is uncanny. It has the same premise as the former issue. The original issue for those unaware shows videos made by unsuspecting kid youtubers (around 5 - 10) being uploaded by pedo users with timestamps in the comment section by other pedos of when kids were in compromising positions. The worse part is that these videos have ads played in them by big brands. Kids, videos, ads and youtube. 

After YT got unwanted heat, this momo issue suddenly came out with the same controversial foundation, but less damaging to YT reputation. Videos targeting kids that are played through ads in youtube. What's disturbing is that people are no longer talking about the pedos in YT. This momo creepypasta have now overshadowed the real issue plaguing Youtube. 

I dunno. I could be wrong but the way this momo challenge suddenly came out of nowhere, without proof, mostly hearsay, with a lame scary photo and a poorly edited video of a PeppaPig episode suddenly playing a ""momo"" computer voiced video sounds all made up, and made up for a certain purpose to me.

Remember the tidepod challenge? Stupid kid challenge that may have hospitalized a few impressionable teens. But this momo video sounds and looks forced. Like it was made with a purpose of just creating controversy to cover up for something else.

The cave was found and the entrance had blocked with stones. This is a fun one",221.0,k3eng6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k3eng6/m_cave_was_a_cave_found_by_a_hiker_named_kenny/,48.0,1606675228.0,"Here is Kenny's original video where he went out looking for the M shaped cave that gave him the creeps:

https://youtu.be/EfdrY-2sROQ

A YouTuber went out to where Kenny was looking for it and ended up finding the cave but it had been walled off by rocks that disguised it. Kenny was actually right at it's mouth in his video but he didn't notice it since it was blocked off and looked different, but that seems to be the M cave right where he said it should be:

https://youtu.be/n2VpNmvwRSM

So this other guy notices there seems to be an eye or something that appears in an odd hole in a rock:

https://youtu.be/oDE8MAf-BhE

I think that could have been light reflecting off a camera lens in the hole, it would make sense to have surveillance there and cameras.

What do you guys think? This is an ongoing conspiracy. I think it is a secret nuclear waste storage area. If you follow Galen Winsor's lectures you will know about the ""nuclear scare scam"". They use depleted uranium for weapons and created a hoax about the nuclear ""waste"" being dangerous. The head of nuclear safety use to drink and swim in it to prove it was harmless so I trust what he says. 

The ""waste"" is actually extremely valuable and the nuclear scare scam is to scare away potential thieves within the industry.  It actually costs money to store nuclear waste so it is even less than worthless...... but that is just what they want you to think, they can reuse the ""waste"" and it is in reality one of the most valuable things on the planet.

I think Kenny stumbled onto one of their secret storage facilities and they tried to wall it up but he kept looking and may have found their secret. Since it costs money to store the waste it would make sense to have secret storage caves to avoid those costs. They know it isn't dangerous so there is no actual danger, they just can't have people exposing those storage areas because as far as the world knows it is super poison and would be a shit storm if it was exposed.

I watched it live and it was pretty spot on. I am going to add the main takeaway points from my perspective. Please add yours if you watched it. And if you haven't watched it please do - link on vimeo at bottom

	1. The virus is a hoax
	2. When testing for this fake virus they are testing for genetic material we all have. They then control the ""curve"" by amplifying or reducing these results. Pretty much everyone tested will be positive because of this
	3. 5G is being installed while we are on lockdown
	4. 5G is dangerous. If set at 60Ghz it will starve your body of oxygen and you will die. 
	5. It can be directed from Elon Musks starlink too
	6. Lots of stuff about the Gates vaccination which I assume most of you know by now, including the digital currency and a chip which will govern what you can and can't do
	7. But hope at the end. Although he didn't state implicitly it was inferred that we rebel in our way. Read into that what you will. I know what I am doing 

Plenty more, but these are the main points for me

We are all in this together folks. Lets stay united

That's right, Big Dick thinks they have us all fooled, example #1: condoms. Why do you think condoms have different sizes? Because men have different sizes? Wrong, that's fucking stupid, condoms stretch idiot. Condoms have different sizes to make men think about their size, make them consider if they can use the big ones, in the end they say no and go with smaller ones, not that it matters, want another example? #2: dildos. Big Dick wants to make us think that dildos are for female pleasure and they have so many people fooled. But no, if you believe this you're an actual ape with no ability to think for youself. The dildo business Big Dick has rammed itself into, hard and fast is actually twofold: make men see these massive dildos and think their dicks are inferior while also making females want bigger dicks. Both these supposed businesses lead into #3: dick enlargement. You see, this is where Big Dick makes the big dick bucks. By making the men think their dicks are too small while making their girlfriends want bigger dick Big Dick pressures men into getting dick enlargements and this, this is where the money is made. Think about it, why are condoms so cheap? Because the goal isn't to make money off condoms but to sell condoms and make men think their dicks are too small. The condom company makes the real money through their partners in Big Dick, the dick enlargements. They sell them and then give the money to the dildo and condom companies for getting them so many customers. The next step? Obvious, porn. Big Dick has also rammed itself deep into the porn industry, immediately signing men up for video after the fresh Dick Enlargements to put those massive dicks on screens across the world, another point of pressure to make men think their dicks are too small. Wake up sheeple, it's time to put Big Dick to an end, be like me, be proud of your 3.7 inch long dick (The actual world average by the way) and fight back.

China has also been taking ALL medical masks and pharmaceutical drugs from Hong Kong hospitals and is now blocking all food shipments to Hong Kong to systematically starve them to death. China is actually selling the drugs and masks that they stole from Hong Kong abroad. This is eerily similar to the Stalinist Ukraine genocide that happened in the 30s.

While the world is being distracted with Coronavirus nonsense one of the largest mass killings in human history is ongoing. The Chinese government is also snatching up any other political dissenters and sending them to the same camps. The Government saw the Hong Kong protests as a threat that could spread to the mainland and have gone into full Maoist purge mode.

Why isnt the world in uproar over this genocide? Here are the reasons:

The World Governments are going along with this Coronavirus hoax to bring about an all digital currency. This way they can introduce a negative interest rate to steal money directly out of accounts without consent to keep their artificial economy inflated. 

World Governments are also using this crisis to take rights away from their citizens that are a thorn in the side of their plans. No more due process required, political dissenters are being arrested for ""displaying symptoms"" of Coronavirus. You'll see people cheering as someone who is falsely accused of being ""infected"" is being arrested and removed from society indefinitely.

The World Governments know if people knew what China was doing there would be war. People of the World would not sit by while TENS OF MILLIONS of lives are snuffed out. This is worst than anything Nazi Germany did before the world made them public enemy number one. 

The fact that a Holocaust of this extent can be carried out without a fucking peep from the media is absolutely appalling. China is running their crematoriums nonstop to hide this carnage and if nothing is done there will be millions more who are snuffed out for the simple crime of wanting liberty.",conspiracy,hoax
176,**Mars/Moon/Space anomalies from NASA photos - the best evidence.**,201.0,6dwgcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6dwgcd/marsmoonspace_anomalies_from_nasa_photos_the_best/,67.0,1496008783.0,"**Mars/Moon/Space anomalies from NASA photos - the best evidence.**


Ladies and gentlemen, space enthusiasts and good people of Reddit. If you would permit me, I would like to engage your brains, and your eyes, for a few moments. 

This is my current complete collection of images of space anomalies. To the best of my knowledge, all of these pictures originally were released by NASA or JPL, with the exception of a few low res photos taken by the soviet lunar probe from the 1970's, and a photo of the earth pyramid in Bosnia that doesn't really belong in the folder but I'm going to leave anyway.

https://imgur.com/a/mg2xI

**What do these images show?**

These are photos of objects and structures that indicate intelligent design. Most of them appear to be ancient and in ruin. The vast majority of the images are from Mars, from the Opportunity and no longer functioning Spirit rovers, as well as the Mars global surveyor orbital satellite. Of the remaining images, most are from Earth's moon, some from comet 67-p, one of an object on Eros, one of Buzz Aldrin's 'monolith' on Phobos, two of the surface of Venus, and two objects captured by the ISS feed that look like craft (terrestrial craft, to my eyes - most likely classified and made by skunkworks. No need to assume aliens! Included because NASA refuses to comment on them). With or without official confirmation, it is entirely up to the viewer to decide if the images are artificial or natural, though in my experience even the most buttoned down of believers in the idea that we are alone and that no evidence from exploration of our system exists to suggest otherwise are at a loss to explain some of the things in the images presented here.

**Do these photos prove the existence of aliens?**

It would be a mistake to assume so. The simplest, most logical explanation is that in the distant past, humans had reached a level of technological development sufficient to colonize the solar system before being nearly wiped out, most likely by the same event that decimated Mars and left it a desert planet where once had been oceans. There are many natural and man made disasters that could wipe out our civilization and send the survivors back to the Stone Age, some of which we couldn't have imagined a generation or two ago. It is quite possible, judging from these photos, that the human race originated from Mars instead of Earth.

**Do these photos belong in r/space?**

Absolutely. All of these photos originate from official sources, any that are discovered to be hoaxes I will remove. Many reference the official source #, though some do not.

**Are these photos enhanced?**

Some are. Most are magnified from the original source. Whenever possible, I have included multiple image views of the same object for comparison's sake. 

**""Enhanced"" means the images have been monkeyed with to make it seem like something instead of nothing.**

It can mean that. For comparison I offer a 'pareidolia' if you will, of a sculpture in front of a cliff face. When I look at it I see a badly eroded figure of a human female with a baby at breast.  (https://i.imgur.com/LywlLZD.jpg) In the enhancement, I still see an ancient statue of a woman with babe at breast, but the picture has been cleaned up a bit. A different 'enhancement' from an overly enthusiastic online UFO rag reveals a painted scene of a buff blond Martian dude with the 'baby' morphed into a green lizard bursting out of his stomach(https://i.imgur.com/ycb3CUZ.jpg). The picture makes a good contrast to the other, so I left it in.

**What about the pareidolia argument? Aren't you just seeing what you want to see?**

Pareidolia doesn't apply to geometry. Geometrical forms in images can easily be measured and confirmed. For the most part, the pareidolia argument was used against faces, starting with the original cydonia face imaged by the Viking orbiter in the 1970's. The weight of argument for artificial constructs lies with the many instances of circles, squares, rectangles, spheres, cubes (boxes), isosceles and equilateral triangles, pyramids, tetrahedrons and other geometric forms. The number of perfectly aligned 90 degree angles forming vertices to be found from the rover photos alone is enough to make case for artificiality.

**Are there photos of faces or figures here?**

Yes. When I first began collecting images of anomalies, I deliberately avoided pictures of faces or of humanoid figures, focusing instead on geometry. Over time, however, the weight of compelling examples of faces or figures that were clear and in focus led me to decide that it would be a disservice not to include them. I draw no conclusions and make no claims about what these actually are.

**Are you affiliated with the Mars Moon Space web group?**

No, though I do follow them on Facebook. You will find some of their images here.

**Where did you get these images?**

Most from Facebook groups, some from websites found via google image searches for ""Mars anomalies"", etc. In some cases I tracked down and cropped the image personally from the original NASA pics. A few others were taken directly from NASA sites as well.

**These are just photos of rocks!**

Yeah. Mostly. For an image to be included it had to have something interesting, but it could just be a rock with a 90 degree angle in a field of other ordinary looking rocks. If I had a talent for visual interpretation I might be working for a defence contractor analyzing satellite data. I don't, something has to show up clearly for my untrained eye to see it.

**How many images are there in the collection?**

Over 1200 and counting, with more being added as I get them. I know there are doubles, but it would be too much work to sort through and delete them. The best ones should still catch the eye and appear artificial with a rapid scan of the thumbnails. At some point I may whittle them down to the 100 or so best ones and repost.

**What do some of the most compelling ones show?**

Buildings, most looking like ancient ruins or foundations, some looking modern and intact.  Various pieces of decaying machinery, at least 3 small boat hulls, at least 3 rectangular 'cave' doorways cut into mountainsides, a wire brush, a handgun, cannon turrets and artillery pieces, military style helmets, tanks, symbols and letters etched into rock (the letter z appears multiple times), two examples of threaded machined screws, boxes crumbling as well as relatively intact, a metal finger ring with a setting for a stone, an object that looks like a toilet seat, another that resembles a birdhouse, two examples of an ornate sarcophagus, vehicles, plants, animal corpses, bones and footprints, water both running and stagnant, stairs, a spoon, an Egyptian ankh or Celtic cross, 3 Christian style crosses, numerous stone and glass spheres of various sizes, metal tubes and pipes, a shoe, artistic rock carvings of various subjects, many more broken bits and pieces of things whose function is unclear. The number 58 appears to show up in satellite photos of both Mars and our moon. If I had to pick a single image to make the argument for artificiality, it would be the orbital photo of the circular building with window bays jutting out from the top of a cliffside that closely resembles the Jupiter II spacecraft from the old Lost in Space TV series (https://i.imgur.com/CtCCMXj.png  being circular, it often gets referred to as a ""crashed UFO""). From the rover it would be the large instillation in the distance laid out in a distinct 90 degree angle at the foot of Mt.Sharp (https://i.imgur.com/kqbuXkS.jpg). Multiple images of both anomalies are included, adjusting the colour and contrast can really bring out the outlines of faraway buildings and is used often.

**Why are you posting this?**

I want answers. I want to know everything I can about this lost civilization. Even if the people who built these things were not human, the overwhelming evidence indicates we were and are more alike than unalike. Their history is our history. I think it's time for the human race to grow up and face the truth about itself, whatever it may be, and start dealing with it. Considering the amount that this knowledge could disrupt all of human culture, it's not surprising that the US government is remaining silent. Consider for a moment the effect of finding a vast archive of knowledge recovered from an ancestral space faring civilization and releasing it to the public would be. It would change everything, but I think it worth the potential risk. This is reclaiming our own heritage, and even if the majority of Earth's people were to focus on learning about the extraterrestrial cultures of the ancient past (or present), interest in preserving our own terrestrial culture and history will never die out, as long as our civilization continues.

Only a few of these images have become well known and are generating interest online, hence this post. There are new ones being found every day, the curiosity rover is still working at this time. It is my hope that the best of these get widely distributed in the interest of creating serious debate among scientists and laypersons without accusations of being mentally deficient or sniggering comments regarding tinfoil hats and anal probes, etc.

Thank you for your time, and thanks in advance to the mods of r/space for not deleting this post (posted on Sunday in accordance with the rules). I understand the cognitive dissonance and stress to the brain that these images can cause to humans regardless of one's personal beliefs. However this is the twenty-first century, is it not? Science fiction has been a popular genre in entertainment for over a century now, we should be able to get over any conflict with our primitive pre-spacefaring notions and start boldly going forward. If we refuse to confront the discoveries we find out there and the implications they have for humanity, we might as well believe that the earth is both flat and the entire universe, cease exploration altogether and just stay away from the edge.

EDIT: as expected, the mods at r/space had the post removed within half an hour. No message or explanation. Sigh.

177,Starting to believe everything involving celebrity culture is a lie.,197.0,lnvjot,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lnvjot/starting_to_believe_everything_involving/,112.0,1613783485.0,"I've been watching a YouTube channel called IndustryHoax, and it basically exposes a lot of celebrities, music artists, and political figures of being freemasons/government psyops playing roles, and they deceive the public through staged events. It mostly focuses on Tupac and how he's a freemason puppet made to divide the black community, but he's used as example of how the majority of Hollywood is ruled by the elite and creates agendas through celebrity culture. He also gets into MLK, Malcom X, etc., 

Now, I don't necessarily 100% believe in any of this, but I do find it thought provoking, and it makes me wonder how much of the media we consume is actually real and authentic. I mean, we've grown up being told by our grandparents that everything on TV is a lie, but what if they were deceived?

Everytime I try to talk about it, people think I'm crazy and they get extremely defensive over the celebrity/public figure that they admire, and it's annoying. It's not like we know these celebrities personally, so why can't we entertain the idea that our favorite entertainers are most likely are in on some crazy conspiracy? 

Me personally, even if I don't really believe in the conspiracy, the channel has ruined my perception of my favorite celebrites and I'm having some serious cognitive dissonance. Now I'm always under the suspicion that there's some deception going on, but I still admire the image they portray.

I'm genuinely convinced the world is fucking stage.

I remember the Iran hostage crisis and looked for updates every night on the tv news. 444 days. (I even changed channels between ABC, NBC CBS to see if they were telling the same narrative. Although I didn't know what a narrative was until I researched the NASA moonlanding hoax, decades later.)


I remember asking my Mom in December of 1972 if she thought the moon landings were real. Her response was ""Well, it was on tv so..."" 

I went through high school listening to history teachers who regurgitated everything from text books.

But I had one really good high school teacher who did Current Events. He woke me up to what the world news was really about. What was happening in Central America during the Reagan years. My mind was blown but I didn't go into conspiracies just yet.

So I watched the Iran-Contra hearings on tv every day. Fawn Hall was hot, Oliver North was respectable but too loyal for my liking. I did not think the official narrative was believable yet it was the official narrative so I took that to the bank. (I justified this by thinking that a jurat would imply they weren't lying, although, I later realized that people will lie under penalties of perjury if they are offered a good escape plan.)

Being a history nerd I went to a local community college and took all the history classes. Totally stunned by the new narratives I was getting. (Worldbook encyclopedia didn't cut the mustard, these teachers, filling me up with new narratives, blew my mind.) Then I ran out of college money and enlisted in the military for the benefits of world travel and work experience.


So I enlisted. Served my time, like an indentured servant, but I took a lot of valuable experience with me when I decided to not re-up. 

Then I chased the capitalist wet dream for 25 years. Fucking credit cards, car loans, mortgages, marriage, divorce, saying ""yes"" to the boss when the real answer was ""no"".

That's what you call a mundane conspiracy and I think a lot of conspiracy folk are focussing on conspiracy like it is some kind of celebrity tv show. It's NOT!

Mundane conspiracies happen every single day! And every day is exactly the same!


I watched the Abu Graihb torture hearings.  Rumsfeld was unvelievable , to my surprise racist Senator Robert Byrd really took him to task. Did you know that Rummy and Wolfy had visited Abu Graihb months before the scandal but they only visited the parts of the prison where Saddam had allegedly tortured people, but, conveniently, Rummy and Wolfy never went to the parts of the prison complex where torture was actually happening. 



I know enough to know that /r/AskHistorians is a scam, a gatekeepers wet dream, don't go there for answers.

The moon hoax debate occupied my idle brain cycles for about 3 years. That was when I really understood the power of good narrative. NASA defenders also respect the power of a good narrative, that's why they stick to the CIA narrative and win arguments when they should be called out for ignorance.

Then I discovered the Mae Brussell archives and listened to about 10 years worth of her tapes, the Nixon-Nazi narrative, and general historical research. That is a free education in conspiracy theory and worth every second. (She was worn out after 10 years but kept going, possible attacks on her family, and by god I was feeling pretty depressed about conspiracies, official narratives and cover-ups that I could not get past the Jonestown Massacre or the John Lennon assassination because I felt as helpless as a newborn babe.)

After 9/11 all bets were off. I knew it was a hoax as soon as I saw the news reports that morning.

So I decided the best way to beat the Big Conspiracies  (JFK, MLK, RFK, moon landings, 9/11, etc) was to engage myself with the lowest level conspiracies I could find. At my work, in Big Telecom. And I found them aplenty.

And those would be the mundane conspiracies that happen to us every single day. Those are the conspiracies where where somebody ""covers up"" what somebody else does wrong.  Knowing that is wrong they do it anyway... as a loyal servant, so they won't get fired on the next downsizing.

Loyalty to a paycheck or an ultimate payoff is all you need to get a conspiracy rolling. And it's very easy to convince low level managers of corporations to comply. I have seen it over and over again. Capitalism isn't real... the only economics is Gangster Economics, pay-for-play, suck a dick for a bonus, I think we all know how these things work on a daily basis.

Tl;Dr DO NOT COMPLY WITH MUNDANE CONSPIRACY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS GREAT CONSPIRACY TO FLOURISH.

Anyhow. Whatever. Good night. Drink up. Smoke up. Whatever you like... just stop reacting and keep digging.

Kirill runs the clothing brand Assholes Live Forever with his business partner Linda Finegold. Kirill recently went into the hospital for a colon exam (no joke since his clothing brand is ALF and he died getting his asshole looked at) and during this procedure it is reported that he died at 37 years old.

His girlfriend Estee Maria has deleted her Instagram account shortly after.

It's an odd coincidence that so much of the ALF site's merch started centering around the theme of death over the last few months, and now this.

Did he plan this?

Did he know it was coming from a metaphysical sense?

He has been banned from Instagram numerous times- his current account was @ kirillagainNow, check out his last Insta post when he was heading into surgery and the text ""See you on the other side""

Also, he had a pending lawsuit with Patagonia:

All of this and no reputable news outlet has reported this.

Is it even real? An April Fool's joke?

Look into it friends, it all seems very odd.

EDIT 1: I think the general consensus here is that KB is alive and his death is a hoax. The question that now remains is why. I think he is 'killing off' his old self. Maybe he is getting married and he is killing his 'single' life? Or he went to rehab? Maybe it's simply to generate publicity and traffic to the site for the move to Mexico. Maybe they are shutting the brand down due to lawsuits? Speculate away!!

Why are is MSM lying by saying ivermectin is only for livestock when it's clearly for humans as well?

When WXYZ news asked all their followers on Facebook to DM them stories of people their followers know that refused the vaccine and ended up sick or dying from covid, out of 180k comments NOT ONE was about unvaxxed sick or dying from covid. Instead there were comments about how people lost people after they took the vaccine. Why isn't the news reporting on people dying from the vaccine when they have multiple sources?

Why are covid cases so ridiculously high in Israel when they are the most vaccinated country in the world?

Why did Pfizer pay the largest criminal fine in history?

Why does FDA approve multiple things that are obviously harmful? Like approving asbestos in baby powder for 40 years! And that's just the tip iceberg.

When someone dies within 28 days of a positive test, it's a covid death, but if they die within 28 days of the vaccine, it's a ""coincidence""? And if they die within 14 days of vaccine, it's an ""unvaccinated"" death?

FDA does not do their own testing on the vaccine NIH does. The head of NIH is Christine Grady. Christine Grady is Anthony Faucis spouse. Why is this not suspicious to any of you?

Why did covid cases skyrocket  after the vaccine came out in every single country that has reported data?

Why did Sweden ban people from traveling into their country from Israel when they are the most vaccinated country in the world?

Why is Robert w. Malone, (the inventor of the mRNA technology) posting multiple tweets that the unvaccinated are not a threat to anyone?

Why did they change the definition of vaccine after the covid vaccine came out? Maybe because their technically not vaccines? 

Why did the maker of the covid test, top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson say that this pandemic; and I quote ""is the greatest hoax on an unsuspecting public"" ?? 

Why do most of these ""fact checking"" sites have billions of dollars tied into the stocks of vaccine companies? 

Why was the co-founder of the fact checking site snopes writing plagiarized articles under a fake name?

Why are 50% of health care providers not getting the vaccine?

Why is CNN now saying 74% of people who got covid in Massachusetts were fully vaccinated? Why is CNN saying the vaccinated can spread covid just as easily as the unvaxxed? 

Why are the threatening nurses and doctors with termination just because they want to choose what they want to do with their own body? Wouldn't we need all the help we can get during a global pandemic? 

Dr. Shiva ayyadurai An MIT PHD in biological engineering and an expert on the immune system, said on twitter that he challenges to debate Anthony Fauci on any news media and twitter suspended his account instead of accepting the challenge? If Fauci had nothing to hide and isnt lying to the masses why not challenge him? Why suspend Dr. Shivas account? 

Why are they constantly pushing this vaccine when it has been proven that natural immunity is 13x more effective?

Most jobs are mandating the vaccine, but why are they not mandating the vaccine for the people who work at The White House, CDC, FDA, Moderna, Pfizer, The Who, and Johnson and Johnson?? 

Why was the Taliban able to survive a year and a half without masks, social distancing, pcr testing, mandatory vaccines, and even managed to recapture Kabul and freely rule Afghanistan in the middle of a global pandemic?? 

10 million people contracted tuberculosis in 2019. 1.5million people died from this infectious airborne disease. Did you even know? Were you scared for your life? Did we all wear masks? Close schools? Ruin small businesses? No. Why? Because the media didn't tell you to be scared. They control you with fear. And convince you to give up your rights and freedoms.

Why are people trusting Bill Gates? He's not an engineer, he never finished college, he's not a doctor, not an epidemiologist, not a virologist, visited Epsteins pedo island countless times, documented thief, owns vaccine companies and owns virus patents. 

Most of all.... Why are none of you questioning this? I'll tell you why. Government: Govern= control. Ment=Mind. The government has stripped you of your capabilities to use critical thinking. You no longer have the ability to think for yourselves. Instead of listening to the propaganda box, break free from their control and question everything. Your future and your families and friends future depends on it. In time you will realize it. But by then it will be too late. ACT NOW! All of us have less time than we think. FEAR IS CONTROLLING YOU!!

**from** [**Cassiopaea**](http://cassiopaea.xmystic.com/) **Website**

&#x200B;

 

265 years ago, a 28 year old German woman named **Johanna Sophia Schmied** who lived in the village of Taucha near Leipzig, gave birth to a monster that is unlike any other. This monster has become popularly known as the ""Chicken Man.""  


*Fate magazine's February* (2000) issue recounts the facts of the case as preserved by the attending physician, Dr. **Gottlieb Friderici**. The physician witnessed the event and preserved the fetus in formaldehyde along with an extensive report of his autopsy, including drawings and the medical history of the mother.  


During the autopsy, the doctor noted that the oversized head did not have the characteristics of hydrocephaly and the tumor like outgrowth was completely filled with brain matter. The heart did not have a pericardium, but was instead, embedded in a ""peculiarly thin membrane"".  


The bone structure was also very different in significant ways from that of normal human beings. Neither the lower arms nor the lower legs consisted of two bones as would be present in humans.

The kneecap was also absent.

The author of the *Fate Magazine* article, **Hartwig Hausdorf**, points out some similarities in the story of the mother of this monster and [modern day abductions](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_abductionabductees.htm). He asks the obvious question:

>""...Do we have surprising evidence for a case of targeted *genetic manipulation by extraterrestrials*, abandoned when the results did not meet their expectations?""

This creature is truly monstrous, and it is difficult to even feel pity for it when observing that nothing in either its interior or exterior configuration corresponds to that which is considered to be human.  


Mr. Hausdorf writes:

>""There are discrepancies in number, size, and above all, certain components are entirely missing while others appear to be 'extraordinarily developed.""

This story and the accompanying photographs, were so curious that I decided to ask the Cassiopaeans for a few remarks at the end of a session last month. I thought the comments were interesting, and maybe you will too.

>**01-22-2000**  
Q: Now, we have this bizarre picture here of this absolutely strange creature in a museum in Germany. What is this 265 year old creature that has been kept in formaldehyde all these years?  
A: Hybridized conception/gestate.  
   
Q: Was there hybridization and genetic manipulation going on almost 300 years ago?  
A: Most done this way are miscarried.  
   
Q: Did it live at all after birth?  
A: No.  
   
Q: Who was responsible for this experiment?  
A: It was not an experiment. It was the result of *Reptoid ""rape.""*  
   
Q: So, the mother was raped by [a reptoid](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/reptiles/reptiles.htm). Why do reptoids rape human women?  
A: We have discussed motives.  
   
Q: Yes. They feed on the fear, terror, or absorb some substance emitted by the sexual organs and/or chakra as a kind of ""food,"" and in some cases they are ""changing the genetic program."" But, in general, when we have discussed this, it has not included impregnating human women with Reptoid sperm. How often does this activity result in impregnation?  
A: Rarely.  
   
Q: So, in this case it did, and here is the result. Pretty horrible.

Going in another direction, a photograph was recently sent to my by a correspondent. I shared this photo with our discussion group, and a number of members declared outright that it was a fake because they could ""detect"" anomalies.  


Well, [**Ark**](http://quantumfuture.net/quantum_future/index.htm) and I did some experiments with photos that we crumpled and drew on the back of, and these experiments produced precisely the effects that the critics were claiming were proof that this photo was not ""real."" We subjected the photo to various filters and enhancements, and even though we are not experts, we had expert guidance.

In the end, we came to the conclusion that we could not discard it as ""faked.""

&#x200B;

 You can see a crease across the photo which is consistent with the fact that the story I was told was that it was carried around in someone's pocket for quite awhile.  


There are some odd geometric markings that show up with enhancement, but, as noted, we did some experiments with drawing on the back of a photo and then scanning it, and the same effect is produced. It looks like someone drew a map on the back of the photo.  


Now, the thing that struck me forcibly about this photo was the hands, elbows and feet of the creature. Look at them closely and then look again at the creature in the jar above.  


Is it real? Do any readers have more info on it? I would appreciate any further data if it is available. 

&#x200B;

 

Update August 2002:

Several readers have written to inform me that the above ""creature"" was/is ""a creature carved into the rock at Cheddar Gorge,"" a tourist attraction in England. The gorge system has many mythical creatures carved into its rock, and this ""imp"" photo has been doing the ufological rounds for ages before someone pointed out what it actually was!""  


When I received the first email with this information, I attempted to confirm it with the folks at the Cheddar Gorge attraction. No one there seemed to be aware of it or the claims that it was supposed to be in the cave.  


Nevertheless, another reader not only wrote with the above information, he tracked down the source of that information: *Fortean Times magazine*. He also forwarded an image of the article:

Even though it now seems that we have proof that the photo is a hoaxed monster, so to say, I must add that the folks at the Cheddar Caves refute the above claim:

While we are on the subject of monsters, in the *Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art*, I came across a most unusual photograph.

It was in a chapter about ""Body Art,"" and the many ways our howling-savage ancestors decorated their physiology. Many paragraphs are devoted to the subject of tattooing, and some nice graphic images accompany these remarks. But only a single, vague paragraph is dedicated to the subject of this amazing photograph that I am going to show you.  


The author, **Paul G. Bahn**, comments:

>""Other forms of bodily art, such as hairstyles and scarification, can only be assessed from prehistoric human figurines and images, except for some preserved bodies whose hair is preserved - for example, from the Altai, the European bog bodies or the early Chinchorro mummies of northern Chile. There is more evidence for skeletal modification.  
   
For example, it is known that the *deliberate deformation of the human skull*, by binding the brow of growing infants or applying pressure at regular intervals, thus giving it a high sloping forehad or a broad flat forehead, was widespread: the phenomenon may even exist among the Neanderthals, and seems to occur in early Australian skulls such as specimens from Kow swamp, 13,000 year old.""

And that's it. Not another word about it.  


Then, you turn the page and there is this picture. The caption on the picture simply says:

>""Deliberately deformed skulls from the Ica area, Peru. Precise date *unknown*, probably early centuries A.D.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2d6yzz6j9yd41.jpg?width=243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70fe43432a5181cc51d44caa70ab06b8e5c6051b

 

And that's it. Nothing said about how binding the head of an infant can deform the skull - but it cannot make the skull grow bigger!  


It seems pretty clear to me that these skulls are more than double in cranial size of a normal human skull.  


Well, I was pretty curious about this so I went looking to see if I couldn't find out more about these skulls that were so casually mentioned to be present in the ""[*Ica area, Peru*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_craneos02.htm).""  


I found an article on the web - which did not have the author's name on it anywhere, so if anyone knows it, please let me know - where there were photographs of the same skulls.  


This gentleman wrote about the skulls in the following way:

>***Begin quoted article:***  
   
The movie ""Stargate"" has become a popular video cassette rental. Its feature film release was met with disappointing reviews, however, a sort of cult following has ensued as people have started discovering the movie by word of mouth. It deals with a touchy subject... Aliens that visited Earth thousands of years ago.  
   
I learned about the film from the company that was producing a CD ROM about the movie called ""The Secrets of Stargate.""  
   
The associate producer of the CD ROM, **Joel Mills**, had learned that I had in my possession photographs that could prove that the movie ""Stargate"" was based on historical fact. They wanted to include copies of the photographs of the ""unusual giant skulls"" that my wife (Bea) and I had collected over the past five years. It seems that the movie deals with the *theory* that extra terrestrials had used humans as slaves to mine metal in Egypt thousands of years ago.  
Mills felt these giant skulls were proof that the ancient pharaohs the the same elongated skulls hidden under their crown head-dress, and that, in fact, the ""Coneheads"" of Saturday Night Live are based on fact, not fiction.  
I pointed out to him that Egypt's King Akhenaton and his daughters were proud of their distinct features (elongated skulls) and the true facts of this royal family are shrouded in controversy. Some historians point out that the giant skulls of this family are a deformity caused by *inbreeding*. Others discount this and claim that it is the *art style of the Armana period*.

&#x200B;

 

>The secret society known as the Rosicrucians place King Akhenaton on their highest pedestal by reconstructing his statue and main temple at their head office in San Jose, California.  
   
Mills also asked permission to use photographs of giant skulls that I had obtained while filming at the Nasca lines in Peru.  
   
Although ""Stargate"" did not deal with a Peruvian connection, he felt the world needed to see the photographs to understand that ancient skulls of extraordinary dimensions could be found at other major archaeological sites around the world, in particular, [the Nasca Lines](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lineas_nazca.htm) and the ruins of Peru.... in the shadows of the [Cheops pyramids in Egypt](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm)... and the ancient Mayan ruins of Central America... *The Triangle of the Ancient Gods*.  
I was happy to send him the photos but warned him that the photos would probably be too controversial for the general public. He seemed surprised at this comment and wondered why he hadn't seen pictures like this before. The complicated answer took a great deal of time to explain! I will try to encapsulate this answer and relate to you a brief history of these unusual skulls.  
I first came across drawings of the skulls in a book by **Ignatius Donnelly** called ""[Atlantis - The Antediluvian World](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/atlantida_mu/atlantis/index.htm)."" The author tries to prove that at one time there existed a Continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that sank into the sea. Before it sank, the rulers left for Egypt, Mexico and Peru and became rulers of these countries. He found information about these skulls hidden in the Library of Congress in Washington.  
I had learned from the Peruvian government that these unusual skulls could be found in many museums in Peru and excavations were uncovering them even now near the Nasca Plateau. I had read **Erich Von Daniken**'s ""Chariots of the Gods?"" and remembered his theories of ancient astronauts landing in this desert area. A few years ago, we were invited to film and photograph these skulls and other discoveries that Peruvian archaeologists are currently unearthing. These skulls are so numerous in the area of the Nasca desert that you can find small makeshift museums in the backyards of the locals. They dug up their ancestors so you can view their remains for a small fee.  
Some skulls show the evidence of ancient brain surgery that prove their ancestors possessed certain abilities that modern science has just recently discovered. Stunned, we wondered why we had not seen photographs of these skulls before. Our guides explained their church leaders feel these skulls are the work of *the devil*, the offspring of the *fallen angels* in the Bible.  
In Mexico we found the same types of skulls in a museum in Merida, a city close to the ruins of Palenque. [Lord Shield Pascal](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_tumba_pacal.htm) had the same elongated skull, an image which is found engraved on his tomb. Erich Von Daniken has described the drawings as Pacal sitting in a rocket ship. The conquering Spaniards found the natives deforming their heads to make them appear more ""god like"" and the priests declared them *devil worshippers.*  
Meanwhile in Egypt, King Akhenaton was also regarded as a heretic and all information about this king was obliterated until just recently. These finding prove that the rulers of these advanced societies all shared the common bond of huge skulls and brains that probably provided them with superior intelligence. This information has been shared by secret societies and religious leaders for hundreds of years and up until now they had decided to keep these secrets for themselves.  
   
All who first see the pictures feel...  
""They show proof of beings from another world.""  
It seems that these conclusions were deemed to be too shocking for the average person and that these skulls were to be dismissed as deformities and hidden far from public view. That is, until President Fujimori took power in Peru. He had decided to allow the skulls to be photographed and has brought them to the attention of the world.  
Resistance to publishing the photographs has remained, and there appears to be a world wide cover-up of the skulls true origins. The only answers seems to be that public knowledge of ""Fallen Angels"" or [ancient astronauts](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_AAtheory.htm) would *disrupt society and the world's religions.*  
I told **Joel Mills** he would probably face the same struggle to get the photos published in the CD ROM, just as we have encountered with the various news media. He felt sure that the time was here and now to wake up the world, and that the movie ""Stargate"" was just the beginning. I wished him luck and success with the idea and sent him all the material I had in my possession to document the facts he needed.  
Several months passed and then one day he phoned to tell me he had left the CD ROM production team and that none of the skull photographs would be included in ""The Secrets of Stargate"". After several run-ins with executives in Hollywood, the pictures wee deemed to be unsuitable for inclusion in ""The Secrets of Stargate.""  
He was much happier with his new job promoting a public speaker that teaches *the history and wisdom of ancient Egypt* and again asked for permission to use the photographs, but this time for private presentations only.  
   
He had learned first hand about the powers that have kept these pictures hidden from the public.  
   
***End quoted article.***

Now, just to give you some other views, here are more photographs:

[This is the second skull from the Cambridge Illustrated History that I scanned. Again we ask: what could cause a skull to be so severely enlarged?

&#x200B;

[If we were to place an image of a normal, \\""deformed\\"" skull on top of this specimen, I think we would find that there is no comparison in terms of cranial capacity. Again, we might think that something other than \\""head binding\\"" is in operation here.](https://preview.redd.it/373ivs6t9yd41.jpg?width=211&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0b5fbe24f060b1e0aa78ce119cc818841adeb5d)

[Are these \\""alien\\"" skulls?](https://preview.redd.it/lwmcc7ju9yd41.jpg?width=367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9abbf2b0d5960c91d8bd18ac7aa9617375fdd008)

&#x200B;

 

Just to try to put the thing in perspective, I searched for an example of ""real"" head-binding in order to see if the above examples could, conceivably fall into this category.

I found a discussion on the subject of ""body art"" and the following paragraph:

>**II.** [**CRANIAL DEFORMATION**](http://www.uic.edu/classes/osci/osci590/13_4%20Scarification_%20Mutilation_%20Dental%20and%20Body%20Alteration.htm)  
The practice of deforming the head was much more common in Mesoamerica than was mutilation of the teeth. The practice of head deformation has a very wide distribution and dates from antiquity. It is an enduring practice known from many parts of the world.  
   
Plateau Indians in North America created a flattened forehead by pressing a board against the padded forehead of a infant swaddled in a cradleboard. Many Indian groups, particularly in the Northwest employed this procedure.  
   
Plateau Indians in Washington state and Idaho created a flattened forehead by pressing a board against the padded forehead of an infant swaddled in a cradleboard. The most famous were known as the 'Flatheads.' In Mesoamerica, deformation was also done by head binding. The Maya used head boards and head binding to produce a distinctive shape which denoted social status and rank in society.  
   
A person of high status would have mutilated teeth, a conical shaped cranium and crossed eyes (produced by dangling shiny objects close to the infant's eyes).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0ei3jc4y9yd41.gif

An image accompanied this article which was a drawing and not an actual photograph.

What we see here is clearly that the head binding practice did not alter the volume of the skull. It *merely changed the shape*.  


In the ""alien"" skulls above, this is not the case. **These skulls are almost double in cranial volume**.  


Considering these distinctions, it is singularly curious that more research isn't being done on these things and that more information about them is not available.

Something so startling and so strange ought to be investigated scientifically.

Note how some of the commenters in that /r/worldnews thread realize they've been duped, but they're desperately trying to justify it somehow:

This person realizes the scam, but they're still trying to explain it away:

>And it doesn't excuse folks who don't have pre-existing/underlying conditions from doing their part to keep the ones with pre-existing/underlying conditions from getting the virus! They have to stay in a bubble while the rest of us get to frolic? That's not empathetic to your fellow American and that's un-American.

You hear that? Some fat fuck hasn't been exercising for 2 decades...that means YOU have to stay inside forever, and not doing so is UNAMERICAN.

Do you see the cognitive dissonance oozing from this sentiment?

Fortunately, the wall of deception is coming down in an unprecedented way.

Also, isn't it amusing how the Mockingbird Media has weaponized the concept of ""Qanon"" to attack conspiracy theorists and independent thinkers? It's the most transparent bullshit of all.

People are waking in massive droves because of the sheer audacity and stupidity of the coronavirus deception:

>Apparently Twitter doesn't want people asking questions about why we nuked the future over this and why everything is still closed six months after we were told ""just two weeks of lockdown to stop the virus"" and ""if we don't lock down there will be rotting corpses piled up outside overcrowded hospitals"".

>Except that it is straight from the CDC website saying that 94% of the deaths attributed to COVID had 2-3 other comorbidities. Without those, you have 6% dead

>a Special Call Out and Thanks to our Communist REDDIt for making sure no actual or even slightly real pro-trump comments are allowed ...also thanks for making sure all we get to discuss in World News is what you want us to talk about,...WHO Narratives...Yay experimental mRNA Vaccines for everyone !!!

(lol)

>Straight from the CDC. You people really want COVID to be a Black Plague, and will do anything to continuously instill fear and make people think it’s much worse than it is. Nothing more than a severe flu

This hits at the heart of the corona cult.

They HAVE to keep believing it's deadly to justify the entirety of the last 6 months.

These individuals will never admit they've been duped to such a profound degree.

>It wasnt false. Cnn wrote a bs fact check article about how the journo said 6K people died from coronavirus total, then in the same article used circular logic and proved her point. The journos tweet said coronavirus ""only"" which is what the cdc metric actually says.

>I think its more important to ask why social media is banning information like this, from renowned epidemiologist, foreign studies, doctors, positive info on drugs that are debatable, counter arguments, based on biased agenda driven news outlets like CNN.

Get ready...they will get increasingly desperate as the coronavirus narrative continues to collapse.

Sadly, once this inevitably passes, many of these individuals will forget everything and pretend they were right all along.

US Is ""Beyond Bankrupt"" - Kim Dotcom Fears ""Controlled Demolition"" Enabling A ""New Dystopian Future""

Kim explains that US spending and debt have spiraled out of control and the Government can only raise the money it needs by printing more of it, which means that hyperinflation is guaranteed.

He says this has been going on for decades and there’s no way to fix it and that the US got away with this for so long, because US dollar is the world’s reserve currency.

When the US Government prints trillions, it is thereby robbing Americans and the entire world in what he calls the biggest theft in history.

He says the total US debt is at $90 trillion, which together with $169 trillion in US unfunded liabilities totals $259 trillion, which is $778,000 per US citizen or $2,067,000 per US Taxpayer.

Now, the value of all US assets combined: every piece of land, real estate, all savings, all companies, everything that all citizens, businesses, entities and the state own is worth $193 trillion.

Our total debt, $259 trillion minus our total net worth, $193 trillion equals negative $66 trillion of debt and liabilities after every asset in the US has been sold off.

So even if the US could sell all assets at the current value, which is impossible, it would still be broke.

This is where the ‘Great Reset’ comes in and he asks, “Is it a controlled demolition of the global markets, economies and the world as we know it? A shift into a new dystopian future where the elites are the masters of the slaves without the cosmetics of democracy?”

He notes how the world has changed so much in recent years and how nothing seems to make sense anymore.

He sees the blatant corruption and the obvious gaslighting propaganda media and the erosion of our rights but he doesn’t know where it’s all going and he finishes the thread asking, “What’s the end game?”

As Harrison Smith from the American Journal says, “It’s a pyramid scheme. The people perpetrating the pyramid scheme are in charge of everything…they’re going to sacrifice humanity in order to maintain their system…

“The world economy is being collapsed, the food supply system is being destroyed, the energy that we rely on to maintain civilization is being curtailed and eliminated and we’ll be forced into the Great Reset where we will own nothing.”

Former BlackRock stockpicker, Ed Dowd believes that the entire COVID sham was created as a cover for the financial collapse and that new lockdowns are coming, to try mitigate the inevitable violence and chaos that we can expect to be witnessing in the streets.

We also saw how Dr Mike Yeadon, former Pfizer VP also believes that COVID and the death shot are an elaborate hoax to engineer a collapse of sovereign currencies to bring in the Great Reset and the introduction of programmable central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), for a wholly-controlled population, in which people will not be able to buy food, etc. unless the algorithms permit and the undesirables can basically be starved to death via artificial intelligence.",conspiracy,hoax

He is well known worldwide as the doctor who spent much of his time fighting for the wellbeing of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia**... He wrote down his experiences in the masterpiece **""Every Second Child"".** Instead of being rewarded for doing so, he was harrassed and his methods were disregarded by the authorities, probably because they were too simple, too cheap and too efficacious to fit modem medical standards. And, besides, they were meant to protect a population which, in its own native county, is regarded by some as not worth taking the trouble for anyway. Dr. Kalokerinos thought differently. **He pinpointed the increase in vaccination campaigns as the reason why, at a certain point, up to half of the vaccinated Aboriginal infants died,** obviously from an acute vitamin C deficiency provoked by the vaccination.

IVN: **Dr. Kalokerinos you started off as a convinced vaccinator when you were working with the Aboriginees, but then things happened. What have been your experiences with vaccinations?**

Kalokerinos: At first it was just a simple clinical observation. I observed that **many infants, after they received routine vaccines like tetanus, diptheria, polio, whooping cough or whatever, became ill. Some became extremely ill, and in fact some died. It was an observation, It was not a theory.** So my first reaction was to look at the reasons why this happened. Of course I found it was more likely to happen in infants who were ill at the time of receiving a vaccine, or infants who had been ill recently, or infants who were incubating an infection. Of course in the early stages of incubation there is no way whatsoever that anyone can detect the disease. They turn up later on. Furthermore, some of the reactions to the vaccines were not those that were listed in the standard literature.

They were very strange reactions indeed. **A third observation was that with some of these reactions which normally resulted in death I found that I could reverse them by giving large amounts of vitamin C intramuscularly or intravenously.** One would have expected, of course, that the authorities would take an interest in these observations that resulted in a dramatic drop in the death rate of infants in the area under my control, a very dramatic drop. But instead of taking an interest their reaction was one of extreme hostility. This forced me to look into the question of vaccination further, and the further I looked into it the more shocked I became. **I found that the whole vaccine business was indeed a gigantic hoax.** Most doctors are convinced that they are useful, but if you look at the proper statistics and study the instance of these diseases you will realise that this is not so.”

I am talking of those at the very top.** Beneath that level is another level of doctors and health workers, like myself, who don’t really understand what they are doing. **But I cannot see any other possible explanation: It is murder and it is genocide. And I tell you what: when the black races really wake up to what we have done to them they are not going to thank us very much.** And if you want to see what harm vaccines do, don’t come to Australia or New Zealand or any place, go to Africa and you will see it [there.”](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio)

While I don't intend to diminish the importance of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, especially with regards to the explanation of the UFO phenomenon, for now we're going to concern ourselves with another possible explanation for many early UFO sightings, a very *human* explanation...

That being said, records of UFO sightings [go back thousands of years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings)

When Alexander the Great began to attack the city of Tyre, five “flying shields” were recorded by both the attacking and defending forces. One of the “shields” shot a “lightning bolt” and brought down the walls, and Alexander's army stormed and captured the city.

[Jacques Vallée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vallee), a well-known ufologist, has come across many unusual incidents in the distant past, including a cigar-shaped UFO that was observed to change course in Europe in 1034 and again in Japan in 1235 when General Yoritsume and others observed a dazzling display of objects in the sky, performing incredible maneuvers. 

As a result of this sighting in Japan, Yoritsume initiated one of the first recorded scientific investigations of the UFO phenomenon, predating the US Air Force's own [Project Blue Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Bluebook) by more than 700 years.

The following is from [Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations](http://www.amazon.com/Covert-Wars-Breakaway-Civilizations-Celestial/dp/1935487833/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394146702&sr=8-1&keywords=covert+wars+breakaway+civilizations) by [Joseph P. Farrell](/r/josephpfarrell), from which much of this research is derived:

>From 1347-1350, Western Europe experienced the Black Death, the massive epidemic of bubonic plague that was, according to some, brought from the Orient by the trading ships of Venice and Genoa, which has fueled speculations and conspiracy theories by some that this was the deliberate act of a corrupt financial oligarchy already touting the idea that the world was over-populated.

However, certain accounts suggest an even more sinister scenario, and I quote from [UFOs in Wartime](http://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Wartime-What-They-Didnt/dp/0425240118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394146612&sr=8-1&keywords=ufos+in+wartime+what+they+didn%27t+want+you+to+know) by Mack Maloney:

>There were persistent reports from the time of strange flying objects moving low through the sky, leaving a trail of suspicious waving vapor in their wake. Wherever and whenever these objects were seen, the plague would soon break out in that area. 

There was also the [1561 phenomenon over Nuremberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg) which has been suggested by many to have been a well-documented UFO sighting.

By the time of the industrial revolution and the invention of the telegraph and then telephone, not only did it become possible to instantaneously transmit information, but it also created the potential of the technological emulation of these sightings. According to Farrell:

>Nothing so signaled this shift as the outbreak in the USA and Europe of the great “airship” mystery of the post-Civil War period of the second half of the 19th century. 

>Most people tend to dismiss the nineteenth century airship mystery as being related to the question and culture of a “breakaway civilization,” but as will now be seen, it is deeply related to the question of its historical origins and the possible motivations behind it. The sightings that broke out in the USA, especially during the 1890s, raised the public awareness of the UFO for the first time, even though these sightings were not at that time called UFOs. 

>Much more importantly, the sightings impressed upon the public mind the implications of two things: technology and its secret development. 

##The 1897 Airship Mystery

For an indispensable study of the airship mystery, I recommend Michael Busby's [Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery](http://www.amazon.com/Solving-Airship-Mystery-Michael-Busby/dp/1589801253/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1394138664&sr=8-3&keywords=michael+busby).

Among his various sources, Busby examined over 1200 newspaper reports, and even though there was “ample debate concerning the flying machines' origins in 1897 (the year of the most concentrated and numerous sightings), including the supposition that the machines were of extraterrestrial design, all of the 1896-97 newspaper accounts referred to the flying objects as *airships.*”

There were other consistencies, as Busby determined that the sightings begin to follow “an easily identifiable path beginning in California, proceeding east to the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan), then changing to a southerly course and traversing Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma before arriving in Texas and Louisiana in April 1897.” Busby continues:

>People saw the airship, or airships, at night, sometimes following a straight line, sometimes stopping then starting again then changing course before disappearing over the horizon. The descriptions of the size, shape, and sounds associate with the airships are similar, regardless of the location and date of the sighting. 

These newspaper accounts were remarkably specific, as most referred to the following:

>Swishing sounds, searchlights and flashes of light coming from the airships, and the obvious ability to maneuver independently and under apparent intelligent direction, sudden accelerations and a cigar-shape or Zeppelin-like appearance, descriptions of sparks and electrical motors, descriptions of “sails” and “fans” projecting from cigar shapes, flapping wings, estimations of their dimensions, and speculations upon their mode of propulsions and potentials for military application.

This leads us to the [1897 UFO incident in Aurora, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident). Busby speculates:

>Were the appearances of these strange flying vessels and the purported crash of an airship at Aurora, Texas, a prelude to the alleged events that occurred fifty years later near Roswell? Or did an epidemic of mass hysteria sweep a good proportion of the country? Were the stories the product of newspaper writers' imaginations? Were the flying machines a secret government project (and was there a subsequent government cover-up)?

It's often claimed that black-ops and fringe research, whether conducted by private corporations, governments or individuals, may be *many* years ahead of what is released for public consumption. As the Wright brothers would make their historic flight in 1903, it seems not unreasonable that someone, somewhere, might have been just six years ahead of the game, as indicated by the spate of sightings in 1897 which reached a climax in Aurora. 

>If the Aurora sighting and crash occurred in the absence of any other airship sighting in the area then it would be much easier to consign the account to the heap of known hoaxes. However, there were numerous airship sightings—more than thirty were reported in the North Texas region—the evening before the crash.

>Two airship sightings were made at 3:00 AM on the morning of the crash, one in Dallas and one in Ladonia. Also, another sighting of an airship said to be experiencing mechanical difficulties, occurred in Stephenville at some early, indeterminate hour before the crash. With so many reported sightings nearby, one cannot summarily dismiss the Aurora account.

The Stephenville sighting is of particular interest:

>An airship was seen near Stephenville early on the morning, but before 6:00 AM, of the crash. The airship was observed on the ground experiencing mechanical problems by many distinguished citizens shortly prior to the Aurora crash. The airship was previously observed on the ground only when it was experiencing mechanical difficulties or the crew needed to replenish their water supply. 

The only daytime sightings occurred when an airship was on the ground being repaired. Farrell expands upon this observation:

>It is this aspect of the airship mystery—sightings of grounded ships undergoing repairs, and even actual contact with their crews by witnesses—that begins to put us in touch with what may have been the first phase in the development of a breakaway civilization.

##Human Crews

On April 10th, 1897, a week before the Aurora incident, the *Dallas Morning News* ran the following story:

>For several days *The News* has contained specials from different points stating that parties had an airship in the night. A man named McKnight has been working on an airship at US Marshal Williams' ranch for some time and it is claimed he has been traveling around by night in his ship. While McKnight will not corroborate the statement, many who are in a position to know say his aerial navigation has at last become a success.

Note the possible connection to personnel of the US government. Also, on April 13th in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, two former soldiers heard an explosion of “heavy ordnance”:

>Later investigation turned up debris which appeared to be “part of some electric appliance” and a “propeller blade of some very light material,” which might have been aluminum.

>In another sighting near Dallas, the day *after* the Aurora crash, witnesses reported an airship at a mere 200 feet altitude. One man saw three men on board, along with “something he took for a large Newfoundland dog,” and heard speech “but could not understand what they said.” From the tone of voice he *took them to be Spaniards or Mexicans.*

Hardly extraterrestrial! The April, 1897 sightings continue:

>On April 16th, one witness spotted a grounded airship in a remote clearing, and a crewman making repairs with a hammer and chisel. And on the day of the Aurora crash, yet another Texan saw a grounded cigar-shaped airship, and three men of its crew, two of whom went to work on its “rigging,” which the third called to the witness and asked him to mail some letters for him!

>When the witness began to take notes of the encounter, he was told not to report about it, and that the crew was doing “experiments” and hoped to “revolutionize travel and transportation.” This is a significant sighting and report, because it tends again to confirm the view that airships represented a secret experimental project of some sort.

A story that ran in the *Dallas Morning News* on April 19th not only named some of the witnesses but also some of the crew/inventors! According to a number of “prominent” citizens:

>The airship consists of a cigar shaped body about sixty feet in length, to which is attached two immense aeroplanes, and the motive power is an immense wheel at each end, in appearance much like a metallic windmill. It is driven by an immense electric engine, which derives its power from storage batteries. 

>The crew consisted, as stated, of two men who gave their names as S.E. Tillman and A.E. Dolbar. They report they have been making an experimental trip to comply with a contract with certain capitalists of New York, who are backing them.

The observation about electrical components is an important one, for many of the airships were sighted near railroad tracks, as Farrell expands:

>The propulsion appeared to be via *electrically* powered propellers, which would be one reason so many sightings exist of people having contact with the crew of the airships, who request *water,* presumably for recharging the ships' batteries. This would be a crucial reason for why so many airships appeared to follow railroad lines, for water towers to replenish their steam engines would be spaced at regular intervals.

>Electrically powered airships—and let it be recalled that within this time frame, Tesla was making similar claims—would not require *petroleum.* Tesla would perform his famous Colorado Springs experiments a year later, and upon his return to New York City, would begin his proposal for the wireless transmission of power, which, as he himself indicated, could power flight.

>Finally, it is clearly and explicitly stated in the article itself that the airships were a *private and semi-secret development by certain capitalists of New York.*

Where is the virus?

I see armchair experts linking this study and that claiming to have ""isolated"" COVID-19...but I see no proof of *actual* isolation of a purified virus from a sick individual.

""Coronavirus"" is an occult ritual of fear on a massive scale, and it comes down to the attempted subjugation of all of humanity via weaponized fear.

But enough doom and gloom, let's talk solutions!

This is an unbelievable opportunity for those who cherish freedom and have retained their humanity to show the world what it would look like if we let *them* win.

It would be a world with no compassion, no joy, and no light.

We are fortunate to experience this attempted coup of humanity, because only by showing our fellow man just how perverse and evil these forces truly are will we galvanize the necessary force to defeat them.

Do not participate in the new system being foisted upon us. Find your own way for your family and your communities. Peaceful non-compliance is something literally every human being is capable of doing. It really, *really* is as simple as just saying ""no"".

There are many orders of magnitude more of us than them. 

**Edit**: RFK Jr. & David Icke just simultaneously gave two of the best speeches in recent history:

I defy anyone to not be moved by these speeches and the sentiments expressed. It certainly was the most powerful moment of Icke's career, and hearing RFK Jr. echo his uncle's immortal ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" is monumental and unforgettable.

We are witnessing the dying gasps of some ridiculously archaic power structures, and as this old way crumbles to our feet, we must hold the hands of those who will inevitably stumble.

I take you back to the summer of 2009, when the CDC and the World Health Organization were hyping the “deadly H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic.”

They were, of course, also urging people to take the new Swine Flu vaccine. On that subject, here is an excerpt from Robert Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense (3/27/20):

“For example, [Dr. Anthony] Fauci once shilled for the fast-tracked H1N1 influenza (‘swine flu’) vaccine on YouTube, reassuring viewers in 2009 that serious adverse events were ‘very, very, very rare.’ Shortly thereafter, the vaccine went on to wreak havoc in multiple countries, increasing miscarriage risks in pregnant women in the U.S., provoking a spike in adolescent narcolepsy in Scandinavia and causing febrile convulsions in one in every 110 vaccinated children in Australia—prompting the latter to suspend its influenza vaccination program in under-fives.”

Thank you. Dr. Fauci. Explain to us why you haven’t been downgraded to pumping gas in Death Valley or sent to prison?

However, that is only half the Swine Flu story. The other half—which involves an astounding hoax—was surely something Fauci was aware of at the time.

Fauci was, in fact, recommending a highly dangerous vaccine for protection against AN EPIDEMIC THAT DIDN’T EXIST AT ALL.

His friends and professional colleagues at the CDC were creating the hoax.

Let me run it down for you.

In the summer of 2009, the CDC was claiming there were thousands of Swine Flu cases in the US. But behind these statistics lay an unnerving secret. A major crime, considering the CDC’s mandate to report the truth to the American people:

Secretly, the CDC had stopped counting cases of Swine Flu.

What? Why?

CBS investigative reporter, Sharyl Attkisson, discovered the CDC secret; and she found out why.

The routine lab testing of tissue samples from the most likely Swine Flu patients was coming back, in the overwhelming percentage of cases, with: NO SIGN OF SWINE FLU OR ANY OTHER KIND OF FLU.

Attkisson wrote an article about this scandal, and it was published on the CBS News website. However, the next, bigger step—putting out the story on CBS television news—was waylaid. No deal. And CBS shut down any future investigation on the subject. Attkisson’s article died on the vine. No other major news outlet in the world picked up her article and ran with it deeper into the rabbit hole.

Here is what Attkisson told me when I interviewed her:

Rappoport: In 2009, you spearheaded coverage of the so-called Swine Flu pandemic. You discovered that, in the summer of 2009, the Centers for Disease Control, ignoring their federal mandate, [secretly] stopped counting Swine Flu cases in America. Yet they continued to stir up fear about the “pandemic,” without having any real measure of its impact. Wasn’t that another investigation of yours that was shut down? Wasn’t there more to find out?

Attkisson: The implications of the story were even worse than that. We discovered through our FOI efforts that before the CDC mysteriously stopped counting Swine Flu cases, they had learned that almost none of the cases they had counted as Swine Flu was, in fact, Swine Flu or any sort of flu at all! The interest in the story from one [CBS] executive was very enthusiastic. He said it was “the most original story” he’d seen on the whole Swine Flu epidemic. But others pushed to stop it [after it was published on the CBS News website] and, in the end, no [CBS television news] broadcast wanted to touch it. We aired numerous stories pumping up the idea of an epidemic, but not the one that would shed original, new light on all the hype. It was fair, accurate, legally approved and a heck of a story. With the CDC keeping the true Swine Flu stats secret, it meant that many in the public took and gave their children an experimental vaccine that may not have been necessary.

—end of interview excerpt—

So…fake pandemic, CDC crimes, and a damaging vaccine.

But that wasn’t end of it. The CDC wanted to commit another crime. About three weeks after Attkisson’s findings were published on the CBS News website, the CDC, obviously in a panic, decided to double down. If one lie is exposed, tell an even bigger one. A much bigger one.

Here, from a November 12, 2009, WebMD article is the CDC’s response: “Shockingly, 14 million to 34 million U.S. residents — the CDC’s best guess is 22 million — came down with H1N1 swine flu by Oct. 17 [2009].” (“22 million cases of Swine Flu in US,” by Daniel J. DeNoon).

Are your eyeballs popping? They should be.

Fast forward to 2020. Who in his right mind, armed with a little history, would believe anything the CDC is saying about COVID-19? The discovery of a new coronavirus. the case numbers, the accuracy of the diagnostic tests, the need for lockdowns and economic devastation, the safety and importance of a vaccine, the fear porn? Who would believe any of it?

And who would believe anything coming out of the mouth of Dr. Anthony Fauci, who hyped a highly destructive Swine Flu vaccine for an epidemic that didn’t exist at all?

Only a fool.

President Trump has [commuted](https://nyti.ms/3iQV6TH) the sentence of Roger Stone, a former advisor to the Trump Campaign convicted in Federal Court of several felonies and sentenced to 40 months in prison. 

In a [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grant-clemency-roger-stone-jr/), the White House asserted that the conviction was the illegitimate fruit of ""the Russia Hoax"" and that ""Roger Stone is now a free man!""

Some questions: 

* How will this play out politically? 
* Will the pardon/commutation powers be reexamined, or is there little appetite for change to the Constitution? 
* Would there be with further exercise of the power? 
* Do Presidents have an obligation to use the power sparingly and without the appearance of favortism, or is it the justified privilege of the executive to pardon as they see fit? (Note this is not a legal question; the pardon power is not in dispute.)
* At what point would a President suffer political consequences for exercising the pardon power? 
* Will this affect the upcoming election?",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax
1,Reviewing all of the current reported facts around the YouTube trailer that incited the Libyan embassy incident. Something seems to be very suspicious here.,236.0,ztiew,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ztiew/reviewing_all_of_the_current_reported_facts/,145.0,1347540693.0,"I've been reading every article I can find about this incident and trying to piece together the facts. Based on what I've been reading, I'm strongly starting to suspect that this YouTube film itself was part of a larger incitement plan. I'm not sure to what extent and how it might be connected but there are some startling questions raised.

Here are the key reported facts about the film itself:

* The cast and crew stated that a man going by the alias ""Bacile"" and claiming to be an Israeli Jew told them they were making a historical drama. The director is at the time claimed in [the Craiglist casting post](http://www.mooncasting.com/us/casting-feature-desert-warrior-los-angeles/) to be someone named ""Alan Roberts.""


* The crew and cast stated [the involvement of several middle eastern men in the initial production:](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1255908--does-sam-bacile-really-exist-innocence-of-muslims-director-could-be-coptic-christian-with-a-checkered-past)
>Klein said he didn’t know the real name of the man he called “Sam,” who came to him for advice on First Amendment issues. About 15 key players from the Middle East — people from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, and a couple of Coptic Christians from Egypt — worked on the film, Klein said.


* Despite their involvement, the cast is selected to be largely white Americans without any particular formal acting training appearing in brown face make up.


* The actors are given alternate fake scripts that feature scenes that would visually match the inflammatory sequences but carefully packaged to completely conceal the film's content. Every effort is made by the 'producers' to hide, deceive, and trick the cast and crew from the actual intent and plan of what is actually being created. After several scenes are recorded with these actors, [the scenes are manipulated and re-dubbed to recast it into a blatant anti-Islamic caricature mocking the prophet Mohammed](http://gawker.com/5942748). 


* These scenes are cobbled together into a 14 minute YouTube video, but it is unclear at this time if an actual full film really exists or the entire effort was to manufacture the short YouTube clip. [There are now major doubts whether it was ever intended to be an actual film or some kind of larger hoax.](http://theweek.com/article/index/233263/does-the-movie-that-provoked-the-libyan-slayings-even-exist) Further doubts are cast when [claims that it was once screened in Hollywood fail to check out.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/origins-of-provocative-video-shrouded.html?_r=3&hp&pagewanted=all)
>He said the film had been shown at a screening at a theater “100 yards or so” from Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood over the summer, drawing what he suggested was a depressingly small audience. He declined to specify what theater might have shown it, and theater owners in the vicinity of the busy strip said they had no record of any such showing.


* When news begins to break and reporters attempt to contact someone named ""Bacile,"" [the man via phone impersonating him tells any reporter who will listen that the movie was created at the behest of ""100 Israeli Jews"" who gave him ""5 million dollars.""](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/12/161003427/what-we-know-about-sam-bacile-the-man-behind-the-muhammad-movie)  No evidence of any kind supporting this claim has been found.


* The man impersonating Bacile is revealed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian man living in California. He pleaded no contest in 2010 to federal bank fraud charges and served 21 months in federal prison. [He has been operating under several pseudonyms. Federal court papers show Mr Nakoula’s aliases include Nicola Bacily, Erwin Salameh and others.] (http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jewish-director-of-prophet-muhammed-film-sam-bacile-may-be-alias-of-egyptian-fraud-convict-8134746.html)


* When confronted by an AP reporter he continues to claim that Bacile is a real person who is a Jewish Israeli and further claims that he himself is a Coptic Christian.
>""Nakoula denied he had posed as Bacile. During a conversation outside his home, he offered his driver's license to show his identity but kept his thumb over his middle name, Basseley. Records checks by the AP subsequently found the name 'Basseley' and other connections to the Bacile persona.


* Two key players in this drama, Terry Jones and Sam Klein say that they were contacted by this man under his alias and asked to distribute and promote this film. Both are known for anti-Muslim rhetoric and Jones himself is known for inciting violence through past incidents. This is what helped create the massive confusion about whether the film was created by Coptics or Terry Jones or whoever. It now appears clear that all of those people were brought in after the creation of the video, spoke only briefly with Bacile, and were told to promote the video at a certain time. [They also appear to have been misled about the identity of the real creators:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/)
>Klein told me that Bacile, the producer of the film, is not Israeli, and most likely not Jewish, as has been reported, and that the name is, in fact, a pseudonym. He said he did not know “Bacile”‘s real name. He said the man who identified himself as Bacile asked him to help make the anti-Muhammad film. When I asked him to describe Bacile, he said: “**I don’t know that much about him. I met him, I spoke to him for an hour.** He’s not Israeli, no. I can tell you this for sure, the State of Israel is not involved, Terry Jones (the radical Christian Quran-burning pastor) is not involved. **His name is a pseudonym. All these Middle Eastern folks I work with have pseudonyms. I doubt he’s Jewish. I would suspect this is a disinformation campaign.**”


* Both men are asked to promote the YouTube video around the date of the attacks, 9/11. Though the video has been online for months at this point, and completely ignored. [Terry Jones, publicly known for inciting violence is brought in at this point:](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h0mrl3Q2GBDz-IB8AR9YyByWKqPw?docId=80b06a6ab90443feb4d91aefb6674cc6)
>Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., who burned Qurans on the ninth anniversary of 9/11, said he spoke with the movie's director on the phone Wednesday and prayed for him. He said he has not met the filmmaker in person, but the man contacted him a few weeks ago about promoting the movie. ""I have not met him. Sam Bacile, that is not his real name,"" Jones said. ""I just talked to him on the phone.


* Reports from eyewitnesses and officials come in from Libya that the deadly attack on the US embassy appears to have been pre-planned. It's said that the attackers appeared extremely professional level and that the protest outside appeared relatively peaceful and largely used as [a diversion until the actual attack began.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-us-ambassador-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1)
>But U.S. sources said Wednesday the four-hour assault in Benghazi had been planned, with the attackers using the protest as a diversion.


* [Libyan commander reports the attack appared far too sophisticated for ordinary rioters:](http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/12/two-killed-as-u-s-troops-ambushed-en-route-to-rescue-besieged-diplomats-in-benghazi/ )
>Captain Fathi al-Obeidi, commander of a special Libyan operations unit, said his men and an eight-man U.S. force came under attack after American survivors had left the blazing consulate and moved to an ostensibly secret location in an isolated villa. The villa came under an intense and highly accurate mortar barrage.
“I really believe that this attack was planned,” he said. “The accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any regular revolutionaries.”


* Some analysts are suggest the violence stemming from the video clip was far from spontaneous. [Nasser Weddady, civil rights outreach director for the American Islamic Congress gives this statement to the press:](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2012/0912/Libya-attack-Who-s-behind-the-inflammatory-YouTube-video)
>“*This has all the earmarks of being heavily orchestrated.* There are extremist groups, funded by among others, the Saudis, who deliberately set out to inflame these kinds of extremist sentiments. The fact that the trailer sat unnoticed on YouTube for nearly two months, until the eleventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. *Then it hit this very sophisticated network of media channels that spew this kind of hate. This did not just happen.”*


*  US officials continue to [investigate the attack.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/13/us-usa-libya-attack-idUSBRE88B1C620120913)
>""It bears the hallmarks of an organized attack"" and appeared to be preplanned, one U.S. official said.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 5 PM EST:**
 
* [Wired has uncovered information that the listed shell company that managed the film was named ""Pharaoh Voice, Inc""](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) and run by someone named ""Youssef M Basseley"" likely another alias of Nakoula. 
>L.A.-based actress Cindy Garcia, who played a role as the mother in the video, listed a “Sam Bassiel” as the film’s producer on her resume. Crew member Jimmy Israel was given the name “Abnob Nakoula Basseley” for registration with the Screen Actors Guild. A company behind the casting, called Pharaoh Voice, Inc., listed a “Youssef M. Basseley” as its president.  
[Corporate listing here.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Hawaiian-Gardens/pharaoh-voice-inc/44853277.aspx)

* Nakoula nows denies any involvement in the film's creation stating:
>Nakoula told the Associated Press he managed a company that produced the video, but has since denied any involvement in the film. “I’m a gas station worker, I didn’t work on it, I know nothing about it. They need to blame someone,” Nakoula later told the Telegraph during an interview outside his Los Angeles home. But on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials said that Nakoula was in fact Bacile. 

* In July of 2011 — the month after he got out of jail — Nakoula started casting actors for “Innocence.”

* [WIRED article cites](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) several other aliases uncovered being used by Nakoula. Matthew Nekola; Ahmed Hamdy; Amal Nada; Daniel K. Caresman; Kritbag Difrat; Sobhi Bushra; Robert Bacily; Nicola Bacily; Thomas J. Tanas; Erwin Salameh; Mark Basseley Youssef; Yousseff M. Basseley; Malid Ahlawi; even P.J. Tobacco.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 6 PM EST**

* We now know somewhat of the process on how the video was spread in the key regions. [Both the U.S. promotion by Jones at the request of Bacile and the promoting within the middle east and Egypt specifically appeared to happen at the same time.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/egyptian-outrage-peddler-who-sent-anti-islam-youtube-clip-viral/56826/)
> The original trailer of Innocence of Muslims was posted to YouTube by Bacile in July, but **never gained attention until last week when it was translated into Arabic and linked to by an Egyptian-American Copt Morris Sadek in an Arabic-language blog post. Around that same time, Koran-burning Florida Pastor Terry Jones began promoting the film to practically no effect in the U.S.** But it did gain the attention of a Glenn Beck-style TV pundit in Egypt: Sheikh Khalad Abdalla, a host on the Islamist satellite-TV station al-Nas.* On Sept. 8, Abdullah lit the match that set this entire international incident in motion and broadcast an offensive clip of the trailer in which a man playing Muhammad calls a donkey ""the first Muslim animal."" 
[Here's the fateful moment of Abdullah on TV playing the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnM_NuW0r9M&feature=player_embedded)


* 3 days BEFORE the embassy attack and before the Bacile/Nousak interview with AP in which he claimed to be Coptic, the story that the video was created by ""Coptics"" was already circulating the middle east.
> Shortly following Abdullah's broadcast, views of the video began increasing rapidly and Cairo news outlet Youm7.com reported that the leader of an Egyptian political party ""denounced the production of the film with the participation of vengeful Copts.""

* Bacile/Nakoula's YouTube account appears to have favorited a video from Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar:
> Sam Bacile, didn’t do much with his YouTube account, besides uploading two clips from the “Innocence of Muslims” film, but he also commented in Arabic on an Egyptian video discussing his movie, and [last month he had favorited a video from the Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar attacking Ibrahim Issa and defending the Salafis](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg/videos?flow=grid&view=15). A video defending Salafism is an odd choice for someone who claims to think Islam is a cancer to add to his favorites.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 7 PM EST**

* [Nakoula himself has a more extensive criminal record than originally known:](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)
>**Anti-Muslim Movie Maker a Meth Cooker: The man behind the incendiary film, Innocence of Muslims, has a criminal record that includes a narcotics conviction. According to a source close to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was arrested by the L.A. Country Sheriff's Department on March 27, 1997 and charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.** He pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Nov. 3, 1997 to one year in county jail and three years probation. The D.A.’s office said he violated probation on April 8, 2002, and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.  Nakoula had been registered to vote as a Democrat from 2002-2008, according to the L.A. County Registrar Recorder’s office. In April of 2008, he changed his political affiliation to American Independent.

* Los Angeles law enforcement officials [had already been monitoring Nakoula, including during the event claimed to have been the film's sparsely attended ""premiere"" in Hollywood.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)
> The director didn’t watch his creation the night of the premiere. Instead, he sat by himself at a nearby restaurant, staring intensely at the theater, the law enforcement source told The Daily Beast. What he didn’t know was that he was being watched by officers. **“You are monitoring the people in the area for behavioral characteristics, and he was displaying them. Normal people don’t act like that. He was across the street, on the opposite side of the block, so he could view what was going on. He was sweating and focusing in on the entrance. He was watching what was going on around and who was going in,”** the source said.


I believe there's very strong evidence here that a low cost, high concept plan was at work to manufacture this video. The fact that it was used as incitement for an attack that also appears to have been organized has only raised my suspicions further. I do not claim to know who or what purpose was actually behind creating this video, but I'm certain that there are serious questions here that need to be answered.",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax

My understanding of the Paris agreement is that it's deliberately based on pledges, not treaties, partially due to the understanding by all involved that any treaty would go down in the US Senate (and of course, because every country wants to cheat a bit). 

The US Republican party is the [only major political force continuing to claim that Climate Change is a hoax.] (http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/whys-gop-only-science-denying-party-on-earth.html) Based on the current Republican primary, it doesn't look like that point of view is changing, even in the face of one of the largest multinational agreements in human history. 

The overwhelming agreement of scientists hasn't moved the Republican party on this issue. The fact that the younger generation who Republicans presumably would like to bring into their food by the time they become the main part of the workforce believe in climate change hasn't changed the party's stance. And now, it seems hard to imagine that international pressure is going to have much effect on the current race.

Let's take a look at some issues and how I interpret them:

**More ""European"" than prior nominees**

Willingness to ignore the religious right and tolerate open the LGBT community is generally seen more in Western European conservatism than in its American counterpart, although Eastern Europe appears to be closer to the religious right.

Entitlements have always been a sticky subject, but Republicans generally have been more open to reform compared to Democrats. 

Trade and economic populism. The mainstream GOP has generally seen this as an extension of free market conservatism.

**Not more European**

Healthcare. Trump has been all over the map, but only one of his proposals  (his praise for single payer in some countries at some time periods) is outside the conservative mainstream, which includes everything from a thinly veiled reboot of Obamacare with just enough revisions to pass off as a repeal to a full reversion to the 2009 system, as far as I can tell. His disdain for regulations is an exaggeration of American conservative consensus in my opinion. 

Immigration and Islam, although both have been tolerated by the elites, have long been divisive issues on the right in my observation. Note that House Republicans sank their party's own immigration plan, and hard-core anti-Islam rhetoric, although sidelined, has been present in the US since at least the ground zero mosque controversy of 2010 and to some extent since September 12, 2001.

Worldview. Although I've seen him described as isolationist, Trump in general strikes me as someone who has a US vs everyone else worldview, emphasized in Detroit, and believes that the US should remain the #1 power in the world by any means necessary and who blames anti-American conspiracy theories for a lot of the US' problems. 

Iraq, admittedly. Trump's flip flopped, but so has much of the establishment (Jeb,  iirc, was pilloried for seemingly changing opinions 5 times in a week). Trump just seems to have the chutzpah to lie about it. Except on Russia, his foreign policy strikes me as pretty hawkish and even there he's threatened to shoot down Russian jets that are too close to US airspace. The hostility towards NATO appears driven by Machiavellianism, not inherent pacifism.

Global warming. His belief that it is an anti-American hoax puts him beyond the EU fringe and at the extreme end even of conservative climate skepticism.",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax

When he retweets a post by a white supremacist, that he either didn't notice or that he actually supports that movement.

To me, his strategy and motives are as clear as day.  He wants to drive the news cycle to keep his numbers up in the polls.  He says outrageous things to get coverage.  Even people who recognize/acknowledge this, though, still default back to, ""He's a fascist racist sexist blah blah,"" when he says something that offends them.

I think reasonable people can *absolutely* feel that his rhetoric and the decisions he makes that empower his [racist/sexist/etc.] supporters could be dangerous for this country.  I think reasonable people can absolutely be furious at how his strategy is damaging our political system.

But what I can't understand is people who think he's either *serious* about what he says, or *stupid*.  There's also the claim that he's a troll - like he's just trying to rile people up for fun - and I don't see that either.  I don't know what his plan is for after he wins the primaries - I'm not sure he even knows yet; I don't get the impression that he plans that far ahead.  But I feel very sure that everything he's doing right now is just about poll numbers and support, and he has little to no personal investment in the things he says or does.  Just like you can't judge an RPG player for their decision to play a murderous orc, you can't judge Trump's true nature by the way he's playing the political game now (except on the meta-level of whether or not it's acceptable to play the game like this in the first place).

And though I started the season thinking he might be a surreptitious force for good, I think too many of the things he's said and done have had real consequences for real people, and the only way that could be justified is if he had some secret over-arching plan to ""save"" the American people in an even bigger way if he got into power.  As I've said, though, I don't think he plans that far ahead, and I also don't like what a strategy like that says about someone's estimation of American people, so I'm going to go ahead and say he's chaotic neutral to chaotic evil at this point.

1.  How much time did you spend reading information from sources such as climate.nasa.gov before you made up your mind about climate change?  

2.  How much time did you spend reading skeptic information before you made up your mind?

The FAA ban of United States flights to Israel is effectively a sanction on Israel's bustling **tourism** industry (show me any other horribly dangerous countries that have booming tourism industries), because of this, Netanyahu and the Israeli's are forced to reveal the truth, that Israel is completely safe.

>Economy

>We believe in the power and opportunity of America’s free-market economy. We believe in the importance of sensible business regulations that promote confidence in our economy among consumers, entrepreneurs and businesses alike. We oppose interventionist policies that put the federal government in control of industry and allow it to pick winners and losers in the marketplace.

>National Defense

>President Ronald Reagan’s approach to America’s national defense, which successfully confronted the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War, is as essential today as it was then: Peace through strength — an enduring peace, based on freedom and the will to defend it. Today, it requires defending America’s homeland, including remaining vigilant in confronting global terrorism, maintaining a robust defense against the threats arising from nuclear proliferation, including a strong ballistic missile defense for America and our allies, and promoting an effective, capable intelligence community. It requires a full commitment to America’s Armed Forces to ensure they are modern, agile and adaptable to the unpredictable range of challenges in the years ahead. And it requires a sustained international effort, which complements our military activities, to develop and maintain alliances and relationships that will lead to greater peace and stability. While the United States participates in various international organizations which can serve the cause of peace and posterity, they must never substitute for principled American leadership nor prevent America from joining other democracies to protect our vital national interests.

>Health Care

>We support common-sense reforms that will lower costs, ensure quality health care that Americans deserve, and end lawsuit abuse. We oppose government-run health care, which won’t protect the physician-patient relationship, won’t promote competition, and won’t promote health care quality and choice.

>Education

>We believe that maintaining a world-class system of primary and secondary education with high standards in which all students can reach their potential is critically important to America’s future. We believe parents should be empowered to send their children to the school of their choice.

>Energy

>We believe in energy independence. We support an “all of the above” approach that encourages the responsible production of nuclear power, clean coal, solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, as well as drilling for oil and natural gas in an environmentally responsible way. We oppose so-called cap and trade legislation that would impose a national energy tax on families and small business that would kill jobs and raise utility prices.

>Courts

>Republicans believe a judge’s role is to interpret the law, not make law from the bench. Judges in our federal court system, from district courts to the Supreme Court, should demonstrate fidelity to the U.S. Constitution. We trust the judicial system to base rulings on the law, and nothing else.

Economy: I don't see any conflicting messages between Romney and his party.

National Defense: Well, Romney has stated that he'd like to expand the military. What I don't understand is how the GOP thinks it can fight a war against terrorists in the same fashion that we fought the Cold War. We won the Cold War because we forced Russia to spend until they went broke. As far as I can tell, we're in Russia's place after more than a decade of blank check spending. How do they expect to fund their Cold War against Terrorism? Are we going back to Cheney's philosophy that ""deficits don't matter""?

Health Care: Ok, the death panel hoax started by Palin has been soundly refuted. How does the GOP disagree with provisions in the ACA if they protect the doctor/patient relationship, promotes competition while making it easier to differentiate between plans, and lowers costs? Are they really that bent out of shape about the individual mandate which is essentially a national version of state mandates for car insurance?

Education: Alright, I really don't understand this one. First off, you can't call our K-12 education system ""world class"" if we consistently test far behind the rest of the developed world. At least they recognize that education is important, but how can they support education when their state parties are working to dismantle science in lieu of religion?

Energy: This... this is just laughable. Four years ago alternative energies were the buzz. We were even pushing the military to switch to biodiesel. Now? Romney's promising to end the wind energy subsidies and there seems to be an attitude that we have to exclusively support big oil and fracking. 

Courts: Another obvious contradiction. The GOP platform believes that judges should interpret the law, not make it, but they screamed bloody murder when Chief Justice Roberts ruled in favor of the ACA because the penalty ""could be reasonably construed as a tax.""

OK, so this has been going through my head lately and now I can't help but believe I'm right.

The Republicans and the Democrats took at look at the last 4 years.  They saw all of the great Republican issues that Obama supported and the Republicans decided that (secretly) they really did like him and his views\opinions.  So they chose a person/scapegoat, (who is in on the conspiracy) to represent the worst of what the majority of this country hates and fears.  They found a billionaire who inherited his fortune, who made more money on the backs of unemployed workers, and who constantly criticizes the working classes.  He insults them, 'leaks' videos trashing them, and creates controversial issues that either affect their lives or makes them angry (i.e. tanning before his talk geared toward the Hispanic population, raising middle-class taxes, reducing elder-care benefits, etc).
Then, they 'feed' information of wrongdoings (i.e. using staff members in their commercials as 'real people') to the media and allow the liberal and independent media go crazy about it.

The only flaw in their plan is that there are hard-core Republicans who don't care about the politics or how it affects them, just about the party itself (I have friends whose taxes will go up even though they are both mostly unemployed freelancers, yet they stand behind Romney like they're multi-millionaires).  However, to counter this, they're finding more ways to turn the politicians from the Republican party against Romney and to Obama, thus, hopefully, swaying some of the less-hard-core Republican votes Obama's way.

I truly believe that Romney\Paul is a hoax, and both parties are in on the conspiracy.  They are happy with Obama's successes and want him to continue, even if the Republicans won't admit it out loud.",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax

So when a politician says ""I don't believe in evolution"" or ""evolution is a lie from hell"" (as one said recently) - can we really trust that politician with anything else?

I have a friend who supports Ron Paul and I noted that Paul doesn't believe in evolution.  The response was, ""I don't care what he thinks about evolution, I think his economic policies are really good and that's why I support him.""

I had to ask - if Ron Paul doesn't think believe in evolution, do you really think that the evidence and expertise he chose for his economic plan is based on accurate information?

I don't think it's unwise to use a politician's ability to assess scientific evidence as indication of his ability to assess information in any other field.

4-5 days ago, Clinton had a 13-14 percent lead in the national polls (Feb 14-15). 538 predicted a Clinton win by 15% in Nevada if she was leading 12% nationally. In addition, if Clinton and Sanders were tied nationally, she should have won by 3%. 

Seeing that the margin was 5%, does that mean that Clinton is losing ground nationally? Theoretically, based on 538's analysis, a 5% win for Clinton means that she's up 2 points nationally, 51-49.

It wasn't just the war. Documentaries were exploding in popularity, including ones on topics we didn't hear everyday, such as Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" bringing environmentalism (and climate science) to everyday people.

I could go on about how things were but I'd rather discuss how they became like they are. Today, many of the friends I had that identified as ""liberal"" now consider themselves ""libertarian"". The right has proclaimed victory of the ""global-warming hoax"" and the man we put in the presidency has upheld many of the Bush doctrines we were so adamantly against. And then we gave him another term for it. Local, national and international news stories are filled with bigoted and ignorant comments and the ""liberals"" are silent or missing entirely in the debate.

What happened? Where did all the liberals go? Why are so many disgusting bigoted comments upvoted everywhere I browse? Why did we stop talking about the environment and how bad of an idea war is? I'm sorry but if anyone is calling Iraq or Afghanistan a ""win"", they're just full of shit. It's a lesson for us and it's obviously one we haven't learned. You can't changed peoples minds about you by bombing them. Is this not obvious?

When did ""liberal"" become a dirty word ... and for that matter, how?",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax

Many also say that climate change is a hoax that man cannot change the climate.

When faced with the fact in a given race that either the R or the D will win, and if you want your voice heard you better figure out which one you want, or your vote won’t matter, they say I don’t care I won’t support …..(whatever). 

When you tell a climate change denier that CO2 is increasing and CO2 raises temperature and people are putting CO2 in the air and we should stop or at least slow down, they say I don’t care, freedom is more important …(or whatever). 

Nether of these people will be persuaded by facts, so is there really any difference between climate change deniers and third party supporters, well not enough for sure.",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax
30,Cliven Bundy is not a racist - the mainstream media has just been quoting him out of context.,0.0,23zvbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/23zvbp/cliven_bundy_is_not_a_racist_the_mainstream_media/,13.0,1398471913.0,"Nevada rancher and American patriot Cliven Bundy has recently come under fire in the mainstream media for making supposedly racist comments. In particular, the media has reported him as saying that black people were ""better off as slaves"".

However, the mainstream media has been quoting him out of context. In context, [it becomes clear that he wasn't saying that black people are better off as slaves, but that he was merely  **wondering** if they were better off.](http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/04/bundy-hoax-exposed-full-video-of-cliven-bundys-non-racist-pro-black-pro-mexican-anti-government-remarks-2944710.html)

In light of the context, his views are clearly pro-black. He recognizes that the Welfare State has destroyed the black family in America, by incentivizng black people to not work and to not keep their families together. Indeed, [the Federal government has created a sort of neo-slave class via entitlement dependency that is so bad it is arguably worse than plantation slavery was.](http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/04/bundy-hoax-exposed-full-video-of-cliven-bundys-non-racist-pro-black-pro-mexican-anti-government-remarks-2944710.html) Bundy made the statements he did because he cares about black people, not because he hates them.

The only negative thing that can be said about Cliven Bundy's comments are that he has an old-fashioned vocabulary as demonstrated by his use of the word ""negro"". But keep in mind that he's nearly 70 years old - when he was growing up it ""negro"" was considered a perfectly acceptable, non-offensive word. It's just an example of the [euphemism treadmill](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Euphemism#Euphemism_treadmill) at work. People objecting to his comments are really just objecting to his style, rather than the substance, of his remarks.

Lastly, there's slam-dunk evidence that the mainstream media has been ignoring: [Cliven Bundy has a black bodyguard, who said he would take a bullet for him](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-talks-to-black-bundy-bodyguard-who-would-still-take-a-bullet-for-him/), even after the supposedly ""racist"" comments were reported in the mainstream media. If Bundy is racist against black people, then why does he trust a black bodyguard with his life?",PoliticalDiscussion,hoax

9,Megathread: U.S. Intelligence Told Lawmakers of Russian Strategy to Boost Trump Re-Election,56699.0,f72zp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f72zp5/megathread_us_intelligence_told_lawmakers_of/,7710.0,1582246088.0,"Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.

The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.

During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.

That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.

The Chief Justice wrote for the Court in _Trump v Vance_, affirming the Second Circuit and rejecting the Government's position that, under Article II and the Supremacy Clause, the President was entitled to absolute immunity and a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoenas. The case now goes back to the district court, where the Second Circuit permitted the Government to make alternative arguments. The vote was 5 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), 2 in concurrence with the decision (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).

The Chief Justice also wrote for the Court in _Trump vs Mazars_, vacating the lower court ruling affirming the Congressional subpoena and implementing a balancing test for the district court to consider in deciding whether to grant a Congressional subpoena, including:

(1) whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants subpoenaing the President and his papers (ie. whether there are other sources that Congress could obtain this information from);

(2) whether the scope of the subpoena is sufficiently narrow so that it is no broader than necessary to support Congress' legislative objective;

(3) what the nature is of evidence Congress is offered to establish that a subpoena is necessary to advance a valid legislative agenda; and

(4) what burden is imposed on the President, particularly since the subpoena originates from a rival branch of government that could use such subpoenas for institutional advantage. 

The vote was 7 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).

Take your time and look through here, there are a lot of resources sprinkled throughout this thread, you just might have to dig to find them all.

**Spread this information around.  Post reminders to your favorite forums and subreddits, talk to your friends and family and neighbors, get involved, get active and get mad.  This is our country and voting is our responsibility.**

---------------------------

**IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME VOTING, [START HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2gy0ep/in_44_days_america_will_have_the_opportunity_to/cknj749)**

Every two years we get the chance to fire every single member of the House of Representatives, and on November 4th our two year wait is up!  If you don't step up and act you'll miss your chance to go to the polls and make your voice heard.  We owe it to Congress to show them just how much we appreciate all their hard work and tireless dedication to our country.

[Every single one of the 435 members of the House of Representatives is eligible to be replaced.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2014)

**EDIT FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE SARCASM: Congress worked just 126 days in 2013, that averages out to around 2.5 days per week.**

**Wouldn't it be great if the American working class could have a four day weekend, every week for the entire year? Or maybe just one massive 34 week paid vacation.**
  

---------------------------

Here are some questions to ask yourself between now and November:  

 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to make wise decisions when it comes to Net Neutrality?  Or do you agree with Republican Representative Fred Upton and Republican Representative Greg Walden that [Net Neutrality is a ""solution in search of a problem?""](http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/538661/republicans_protest_fcc_net_neutrality_move_isps_less_concerned/)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to make wise investments in science and technology?  Or do you agree with Republican Representative and member of the House Science Committee Paul Broun that science such as evolution, embryology, and the big bang theory are [""lies straight from the pit of hell?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rikEWuBrkHc)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to support equal rights for homosexuals, or do you agree with Representative Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. that [""The court-ordered redefinition of marriage in several states … is an assault on the foundations of our society, challenging the institution which, for thousands of years in virtually every civilization, has been entrusted with the rearing of children and the transmission of cultural values?""](http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/11/07/gay-rights-foe-marsha-blackburn-reelected-congress-tennessee)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to enact new regulations that will help slow or halt the advance of climate change, or do you believe that it's a hoax because [“If you believe in the Bible, one would have to say the Great Flood is an example of climate change. That certainly wasn’t because man had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy.” as Representative Joe Barton, R-Texas does?](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/republican-congressman-cites-biblical-great-flood-to-say-cim)  
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives to help the poorest amongst us and raise Americans out of poverty, or do you think something like raising the minimum wage [""would do more harm to our economy than anything. You work at Arby’s, the cost of products, the cost of services are going to go up. [...] If we are going to make it a living wage, who’s going to pay for it? Who’s going to pay for it?"" as was suggested by Representative Dennis Ross, R-Florida.](http://thinkprogress.org/election/2014/04/16/3427197/dennis-ross-minimum-wage/)
  
 * Do you trust the current House of Representatives, or are you going to vote them out?

---------------------------
  
I'd also like to address some of the common concerns when I try to encourage people to vote:

 * **""They're all the same anyway.""**
   * This is demonstrably not true.  Currently our political parties are more polarized than they have been in more than a century.  If we look at [party-line votes in the Senate](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/senate/members/) and [the House of Representatives](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/house/members/) the distance between the parties are obvious.  For the average Redditor the differences between the haven't been as stark in our lifetimes. (These visulizations may be easier to read: [Senate Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=892) | [House Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=887))  
 * **""Not voting is the same as a vote of no confidence.""**
   * We have tried not voting before.  In fact we have tried not voting sixteen times in the last seventy years.  Less than half of eligible voters turned out for midterm elections in [1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/voter-turnout/) which means that in 100% of midterm elections since 1950 a *minority* of Americans were allowed to pick a new House of Representatives.
   * Not voting is tantamount to saying ""Things are good enough in my life that I'm going to let you keep your job"" because why would an elected official change anything if they're reelected?  They don't care if they win with 100% turnout or if they win with 10% turnout just as long as they win.
   * Not voting just gives more power to the people who *do* show up.  
 * **""Voting doesn't change anything anyway.""**
   * Nothing changes all at once but our history is riddled with slow but steady progress.  We have seen since 2010 the damage that can be caused by a single election, how one bad election can slow progress to a crawl and even drag us backwards.  Voting *can* and *does* make a difference, but first you need to vote.   
 * **""My vote doesn't count.""**  
   * No, your vote alone won't win the election.  Vote anyway.  You; by yourself, won't win a tug-of-war, that's why we all work together and we need *you* to pull your weight, especially now.
 * **""My district is [gerrymandered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) too much for the opposition to stand a chance.""**
   * Gerrymandering has no effect on state-wide elections, so if you don't vote because of gerrymandering you're missing out on the opportunity to vote for Governor, Senator and any of a number of ballot initiatives.  
 * **""There's no one on the ballot that represents me, or represents my views.""**
   * Then you need to represent your views for yourself.  Go to the polling place and write in ""NO CONFIDENCE"" for any; or all, of the eligible seats.  Not voting says nothing but ""Everything is fine, my life is good, I don't want anything to change"" so go and vote ""NO CONFIDENCE"" and make your voice heard.
 * **""If voting changed anything it would be illegal.""**
   * For the vast majority of human history voting was functionally illegal, as leaders were picked through birth or war or appointment or God.  The very thought of letting the people vote was considered dangerous and absurd.  
   * When our country was founded it was illegal for anyone except white, land owning males to vote.
   * It was illegal for African Americans to vote until 1870.
   * It was *practically* illegal for African Americans to vote until 1965.
   * It was illegal for women to vote until 1920.
   * It was illegal for 18 year-olds to vote until 1971.  
 * **""Why should I have to choose between a Douche Turd and a Giant Sandwich?""**
   * I guess you should have voted in the primaries so that D. Turd and G. Sandwich would never have gotten to the general election... 
   * Also: No human is so black or white, no policy is so clearly right or wrong, no political party is so good or evil.  The Sandwich analogy is a painful oversimplification of both voting and of political candidates.
   
There are those who will try to tell you that they're too weak, that they're actions and votes are worthless, that it is better to sit in silence than to stand up and be counted; these people have become so convinced of their powerless impotence that they will try to convince others of the same thing.  Just like an alcoholic will try to force you to drink, the timid will try to force you to stay silent.  Smile and nod and vote anyway, because you are not weak, you are not powerless, you are not impotent unless you let yourself be.

Think of them like the fat friend that's always trying to convince you to eat cake.

The biggest point I would like to make here is that yes, your vote does count.  The person who convinces you not to vote, votes twice.

This was a big team effort here, many thanks to other producers and crew Allison Girvin, Hussein Saddique, Maura Barrett, Andrew Kozak, Michael Cappetta, Business and Technology correspondent Jo Ling Kent, and reporters Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny, and all of our fantastic experts and guests who shared their knowledge and time.

The title “Factory of Lies” comes from a phrase used by former Internet Research Agency worker Vitaly Bespalov to describe his previous employer in an interview last year and it stuck with me. It feels a little scary but also appropriate for an industrial bureaucracy designed to systematically pumped out disinformation and undermine democratic conversations. We’ve all been watching with great alarm and dismay as the fuller extent of the Russian disinformation operations come into sharp relief while the U.S. response has been uncoordinated and lacking in executive leadership. Journalists have not done a full fessing up on how the Russian-hacked Wikileaks content was laundered through the media. And the social media platforms have managed to avoid major repercussions to their business models by deflecting and denying their responsibility and exerting influence. I can’t count how many times we head it was only this x small percent of the total content. Well, that’s no way to gauge impact. What percentage of your body weight is the lethal dose of cyanide?

But a critical moment came this summer when I read [descriptions of historical KGB documents detailing Cold War disinformation campaigns ordered by the Kremli](https://imgur.com/a/9sbpjQm)n. They sounded and operated exactly like some of the heinous online hoaxes from the 2016 presidential campaign whose origins have been traced back by the intel community, social media companies, and online community of troll hunters to Russian information operations. The more I researched the more it became apparent that there was a centrally organized system of Russian disinformation tradecraft that has been handed down over the ages. And the more you learned about it, the easier it is to spot.

That was the story we wanted to tell and we hope people walk away better informed. Because even if you don’t agree that it has any impact whatsoever, no one likes it when someone tries to manipulate them.

Happy to answer any questions about the reports content or production, historical KGB stuff we uncovered that didn’t make the script, and shoot around ideas for spotting and stopping disinformation attacks, foreign and domestic!

Stick around to the end of the AMA and I'll post a link to an unpublished clip from our interviews showing a sort of secret weapon for disarming disinformation.

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

>The membership of CyberBerkut is anonymous, but reportedly includes former officers in the Crimean Berkut. That unit was part of Ukraine's Interior Ministry until Crimea's March 2014 annexation, upon which the Crimean Berkut was incorporated into Russia's Interior Ministry. CyberBerkut's ""Ukrainian identity"" is vigorously asserted, however, as it postures as an internal opposition group. 

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

Here's a good article to read: [The pro-Russian Disinformation Campaign

I see from reddit.com/r/The_Donald that you people already hate Soros (links often lead to Russian disinformation websites) and think NATO should turn into a protection racket, ignoring basic hegemonic theory and forward deployment strategy of the U.S. near Russia and China. 

As an example, take a look at this conspiracy theory (and irrational) self post from /r/The_Donald:

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

For now, read some of this history regarding Soviet Active Measures (relevant to our current situation):

[Soviet Active Measures

Possible EU members for this thought experiment include Cyprus, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Greece, Slovenia, Finland, or Slovakia. Possible developing countries could include Yemen, Djibouti, Eritrea, Senegal, Gambia, Zimbabwe, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, Bhutan, any of the 'stans, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, or Venezuela.

1) A country with a history of an aggressive foreign policy and numerous wars elects an internationally popular moderate president or PM.

2) Shortly after the government's election, a grassroots wave of opposition officials begin altering voting laws (redrawing district borders in an FPTP system and local thresholds in a proportional system, for instance, along with changing voting locations and registration requirements, adding identification/registration fees that hadn't existed previously, and even [deleting registrations for thousands upon thousands of voters.](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/08/22/20079/america-scrubs-millions-voter-rolls-it-fair)). These gradually and significantly weaken the government parties. There's evidence submitted and verified by courts that at least some of these officials targeted ethnic groups that supported government parties.

3) After one or two national election cycles, the opposition is led by a controversial populist with a history of legally questionable activities. He or she is surrounded by shadowy characters with ties to foreign governments and [frequently makes statements implying that ethnic minorities are trying to steal the election.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/11/donald-trump-warns-that-other-communities-are-poised-to-steal-the-election/) This candidate frequently dabbles in conspiracy theories and his or her son [at least once appears on a racially supremacist radio show.](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/03/listen-donald-trump-jr-and-pro-confederate-whit/208993) Externally, this opposition candidate calls for a harsh line on foreign policy, including bombing foreign citizens in their own countries because of the crimes of their relatives, calls for stiff tariffs, implications that international climate action is a ""hoax"" to ""keep us poor"", calls for banning an entire religious group from visiting or setting foot on their soil, and regularly making politically incorrect if not racist remarks about other countries ([for instance implying that Japanese would rather 'watch Sony TV' than engage in foreign policy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/donald-trump-savages-japan-saying-all-they-will-do-is-watch-sony/)). One of his or her surrogates challenges the territorial integrity of a small European country by saying ""it's basically in someone else's [suburbs](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/438260/estonia-newt-gingrich-and-strategery)"".

4) The leading opposition candidate calls on live television for the president/PM to be hacked by a foreign power. In the weeks leading up to the election, there is increasing evidence that individuals close to that candidate have had ties to officials within that foreign power. 

5) The head of the country's national law enforcement agency, who is reported to be an opposition sympathizer, releases a cryptic letter implying that new damning evidence has been found tying the government candidate to criminal activity. He later clarifies the matter.

6) After the opposition leader calls for their opponent to be hacked, a series of emails are leaked from the governing parties showing them engaging in lawful but unethical conduct.

7) The election reveals that, in spite of a significant majority of voters voting against the opposition, that the erstwhile opposition has complete control of the national government and of the vast majority of state and local governments. 

8) The weeks following the inauguration of the new government see dozens of bombing raids on other countries as well as the passage of policies shredding the country's involvement in the Paris climate treaty, among others. The new government begins sending ""invoices"" demanding money from trading partners and military allies.

Nevertheless, Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, offers that the US ignored or even actively killed off in order to *prevent* a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive as a justification for a policy of imposing regime-change.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html

Mohammad Elbaradei, the Egyptian director of the IAEA noted this:
>""I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers

http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

Even in the first Obama administration, Iran agreed to the terms of a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey according to which Iran would have exported its enriched uranium in the hopes of receiving the reactor fuel it had been denied, only to see the Obama administration pull the rug out from under them AFTER Iran had said yes to the deal, upsetting the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just a week earlier endorsing the same terms that Iran had agreed to

http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

One American expert on Iran affairs, noted that the very day after Iran had agreed to these terms, the US proceeded to impose yet more sanctions on Iran

http://garysick.tumblr.com/post/611735702/giving-the-finger-to-iran-and-turkey-and

The Bush administration had started out imposing an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -

http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/

which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty to be able to make their own reactor fuel (which thanks to US sanctions, Iran was not able to import as usual.) This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal by making demands that *no country would accept.*

The second Obama admin eventually dropped the zero enrichment demand, http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-backed-key-u-s-shift-toward-iran-nuclear-deal-1441753099?mod=rss_US_News

and thus signaled that it is willing to actually resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. 

The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are POSSIBLY finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.

That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the pro-Israeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.

http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam

There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity.

http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530

So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs. 

To make up for the lack of evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program in the past, the issue is instead framed as concern about Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes in the indefinite future.

In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably.

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes.
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There is a significant difference: the *capability* to make nukes is not illegal but the media coverage obfuscates this significant difference. In fact the NonProliferation Treaty is actually also intended to *promote* nuclear technology (which has to be shared ""to the fullest extent possible"" and ""without discrimination"") -- thus having the ""capability"" to make nukes is not a violation of the NPT but actually an inevitable part of following the NPT.  

The US National Intelligence Estimate concluded that while Iran was engaged in ""nuclear-related studies"" until 2003 (for which the actual evidence is very questionable - more below) there's no sign they're interested in nukes now -

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/middleeast/us-agencies-see-no-move-by-iran-to-build-a-bomb.html 

a conclusion that the Israelis agreed with, http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/mossad-cia-agree-iran-has-yet-to-decide-to-build-nuclear-weapon-1.419300 

The Russians noted there was no evidence of nukes either http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/10/iran.russia

There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.

>Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php

According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:

>I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html

And

>With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

and

>The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece

Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director

>The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703

and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required, in addition to suspending enrichment of uranium entirely for more than 2 years in the past, and currently.

>""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it

Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA
http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511

So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks) say Iran is not making nukes

And actual arms inspectors

>Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case.

The US has been pushing some documents as proof that Iran supposedly engaged in nuclear-related studies (Called the ""Alleged Studies"" by the previous IAEA director, and ""Possible Military Dimensions"" by the new, US-backed IAEA director) until 2003 however the evidence -- to the extent the US has actually let anyone including the IAEA or Iran to see -- has been laughed at
http://www.ips-dc.org/whipping_wisps_into_storm_clouds_iran_and_the_alleged_studies/

There have also been a variety of half-baked leaks of ""proof"" of a nuclear weapons program in Iran, for example the ""AP Graph""
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-graph-suggests-iran-working-bomb
which turned out to be a hoax

http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/Flawed-graph-weakens-case-against-Iran-nuclear-program-video

The US had even pressured the IAEA to accept these documents as proof against Iran, but the IAEA refused, and the IAEA director Elbaradei called the allegations ""hype"" leading to some in Congress to accuse the IAEA of ""censoring"" the reports and hiding a ""Secret Annex""
http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/05/iaeas-man-in-dc-no-secret-annex-on-iran/
which proved Iran's nuclear weapns program's existence. The Israelis even accused the IAEA head Elbaradei of being an ""Iranian agent"" http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4146150,00.html.

The US went after Elbaradei, http://no.alt.diskusjoner.usa.narkive.com/dCbdwInF/jakten-pa-elbaradei including tapping his telephones http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57928-2004Dec11.html.

The IAEA replied that charges of it censoring info on Iran are ""baseless and politically-motivated"" http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917
and that there was still no evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran,
http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

But once the new US-backed IAEA Director, Amano, came into office after a highly contested election http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/26/us-nuclear-iaea-election-idUSTRE52O7P220090326
in which he had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks, and http://www.ips-dc.org/current_chief_of_iaea_releases_its_brakes_on_rush_to_war_with_iran/

Amano released the so-called ""Secret Annex"" that the previous iAEA director had refused to endorse, which supposedly proved everything about Iran's nuclear weapons program -- but despite the pre-release hype, it turned out to be a dud that didn't say anything new, and actually showed the evidence against Iran was ""thin"" as a former IAEA inspector concluded
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1109/Iran-nuclear-report-Why-it-may-not-be-a-game-changer-after-all

Later, the trial of a CIA whistleblower showed that the CIA may have even been planting evidence in Iran, so it could frame Iran

This book is all about that
http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338

In short, the previous US policy of trying to use the exaggerated threat of a non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons program as a pretext and justification for a policy of imposing regime-change in Iran, was a giant backfiring fiasco. It only led to Iran's further development of its nuclear program which now the US has to negotiate down, and also created a nationalistic backlash in Iran, where the vast majority of poeple support their governments position.

(2016.05.02, summarized)

Trump said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including
Saudi Arabia.

Trump has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries
that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us
at home.

He believes we can default on our debts to the rest of the world,
which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we
experienced in 2008.

He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.

He praises dictators like Putin and picks fights with our friends.

Including the British PM, the mayor of London, the German chancellor,
the president of Mexico and the Pope.

No other country comes close to matching our military, our capabilities.

I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen,
brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the
reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia and twisted arms to bring the
world together in global sanctions against Iran. And I have, I have
sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the
toughest choices he faced.

If America doesn’t lead, we leave a vacuum. That will either cause
chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they’ll
be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety. The choices they make will not be to our benefit.

Our armed forces fight terrorists together with our allies. Allies
provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to
events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence
that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.

North Korea is perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run
by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that
could carry a nuclear weapon to America.

When I was
Secretary-of-State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South
Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile
defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead,
should it launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it
are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it.
And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to
test it.

Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the
world, because they have nothing to match them.

Trump talks about leaving NATO. He says he’ll stay neutral on Israel’s security.

Trump suggests that America should withdraw our military support for
Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons. He said this about a war
between Japan and North Korea. “If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy
yourself, folks.” I wonder if he even realizes he’s talking about
nuclear war.

Our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point
long before Trump came onto the scene. A number of them have increased
their defense spending.

We need to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten
us at home.

When Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. 

Some
called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war
that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.
President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the
effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the
table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that
should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Now we must
enforce that deal vigorously. 

The world must understand that America
will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to
stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

In particular, Israel’s security is non-negotiable. They’re our
closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend
them.

We are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we
accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb
or putting a single American soldier in harm’s way. Trump says we
shouldn’t have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that
would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their
nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling
the world, good luck, you deal with Iran? Of course Trump doesn’t have
answers to those questions.

Countries like Russia and China often work against us.
Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers.

Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on
NATO’s doorstep.

I worked with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce
nuclear stockpiles,
I worked with China to increase pressure on North Korea.
Our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change,
which Trump now wants to rip up.

Trump wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of
Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a
trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the
1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine
that with his comments about defaulting on our debt.

He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength.

He said, “You’ve got to give KimJongUn credit” for taking over North
Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat,
including his own uncle.

We need to take out ISIS-strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying
the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish
forces on the ground.

We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria’s civil war and close
Iraq’s sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS
alive.)
We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence
services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that
supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists.
Trumps’s actually said “maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.”
Sure, let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the
Middle East.
Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground
troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.
He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which
would mean mass civilian casualties.
Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground
war. These are all distinct possibilities with Trump in charge.
His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from entering our country is a
huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries
we need to actually help us in this fight.
I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating
the potential Osama operation. The President’s advisors were divided.
The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of
failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle
against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the
lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.",geopolitics,hoax

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.


_________

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.

Some background information on the feud between Putin and Hilary Clinton.

[https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/03/fake-corona-virus-apocalypse.html](https://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2020/03/fake-corona-virus-apocalypse.html)

We don't have complete data on the death rates to see if it actually jumped that high; However the CDC has started their own count based on birth certificates which take up to eight weeks or more to compile getting most of them within four to six weeks.

Worldometer is claiming to get instant data as it happens, which is virtually impossible, yet academic sources and media outlets cite them as a credible source. Anyone that knows anything about collecting this data should be suspicious.

There's no doubt there's lots of hoaxes going on; but the official hype is as bad as the fringe hoaxes which means that something far-fetched is happening, even if most conspiracy theories fall apart fast.

Within four to eight weeks the CDC will have much better data; and will either confirm or refute the numbers now being used to panic people. But they already put out enough information to raise doubts about the data that was put out several weeks ago.

This is also spurring a lot of Apocalyptic conspiracy theories, and the excessive hype from media and incompetent government is making this seem more credible. Even though the vast majority of these theories are seriously flawed, there are many legitimate unsolved mysteries that might be connected to this pandemic to indicate that some of them might have small pieces of truth to them.
