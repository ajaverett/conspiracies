1,Calling all scientific minds who feel some way about COVID-19!,8506.0,fp3x5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fp3x5b/calling_all_scientific_minds_who_feel_some_way/,698.0,1585191295.0,"I am in the process of setting up a website dedicated to increasing accessibility of scientific articles. In times like this, people take what the media gives them and either swallow it or are dissatisfied buy lack the resources to develop their own conclusion.

There are a wealth of studies dating back \~15 years about studies relating to bat coronaviruses, engineering viruses to do with the ACE2 receptor (the receptor COVID-19 utilises), and increasing pathogenicity in human cells. Alongside this, there are multiple credible articles to do with scientific discourse regarding virus creation, bribes linking Wuhan and Harvard, and containment breaches of SARS.

It is not a conspiracy site. It is a collation point for articles and studies the media is refusing to bring up, and only credible ones. CREDIBILITY IS KEY. I do not want to push a viewpoint; I want to allow people the freedom and the ability to synthesise their own opinion, except with all the facts.

I am after volunteers (I am not making nor intending to make money) with a scientific background to translate these studies into digestible bites (around 300-600 words) that someone with no scientific background could understand. Not condescending, but informative and simple, while maintaining accuracy. Take out the scientific jargon that makes the studies so difficult to understand, and try to explain them to an intelligent member of the public. There is a brimming pool of people who don't know who to trust or where to go, so I want to create a little platform for them.

If you aren't interested in writing but you have articles or studies you think would be useful, please DM them to me or leave them in the comments! I am a biotechnology (drug design) student, so I am also translating them. I just need help to get this on the move quickly!

EDIT: AHHHHHH WHAT A RESPONSE!! I am overwhelmed with the interest and did not expect this many people to believe in my idea. I am trying to respond as comments come in, but every single comment is appreciated! If I missed your comment (and I am so so sorry if I did) please DM me and we'll go from there!

EDIT 2: my DMs have stopped working. I am sending this form to everyone interested about your background study and skills and I CANNOT REPLY TO YOUR DM, IT WON'T LET ME. Anyone know why?

This was building on a 2007 study where they tried combining a [*SARS-like bat coronavirus with HIV pseudovirus* that was not previously infectious to humans](https://jvi.asm.org/content/82/4/1899). While they were researching the SARS-like bat Coronavirus, they were unhappy with the low rate at which it infected human cells. So they genetically altered it to make it infect human cells more effectively -- by giving it an HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) outer shell, which enabled the SARS-like coronavirus to attack human cells via ACE2 receptors.

Yet, despite how much overwhelming facts point to this, it’s still not true because they said so? Again no one is denying it came from bats, so they arent debunking anything. It is also **not a bioweapon**, i never claimed it was, so they are not debunking anything there either.

**FYI you’ll notice a lot of these articles have disclaimers (some brand new since yesterday) about them being used as a conspiracy. They offer absolutely no counter argument** other than “it came from bats, therefor it is not from the lab.” Uhh okay, not disputing it came from bats.

People on campus are afraid to question China's influence efforts for fear of being labeled xenophobic or racist. Colleges are so concerned about being called ""intolerant"" that they let a communist regime exploit our country.

People will call you a conspiracy theorist if you question why China is secretly spending millions on buying off American professors.  Ask those people if they believe China is just doing all this out of the goodness of their hearts.

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were removed from the lab and the University of Manitoba, including Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Dr. Keding Cheng and students they brought from china with connections to labs in Wuhan.

The couple is under investigation in relation to an ""improper package"" that reportedly prompted a security breach.

When the shipment from Canada was uncovered, security access was revoked for Qiu, her husband, and the Chinese students. IT specialists entered Qiu’s office after hours to gain access to her computer, and her regular trips to China were halted.

>[https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/](https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/)

Qiu reportedly made at least five trips over the academic year 2017-18 alone to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Chinese students from a notable range of Chinese scientific facilities have joined Qiu at the NML over the past decade.

Of those facilities, four are believed to be involved in Chinese biological weapons development. They are:

* Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun
* Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region
* Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei
* Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing

I have followed the Hunter Biden saga for years. Allow me to sum up and address some of the disinformation that is part of the modified limited hangout being run.

First, there are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Is Hunter Biden a pedo? Yes. He searches for underage porn. He is constantly accused of being a child molester. He sleeps with Natalie Biden. He sleeps with young cousin Lilly. He engages in grooming behavior and is likely providing drugs to underage family members.

But, his criminality doesn't stop there. I get that people want the salacious stuff, first, but keep in mind, Hunter Biden participates in policy decisions with the President of the United States.

This corruption is merely an extension of what Hillary Clinton began with the Uranium One scandal, where the mining/energy complex is consolidating power monopolistically.

In fact, we see an extension of these globalist type plans for American resources plain as day in Hunter's data.

https://i.redd.it/ha341tgur5b91.png

I don't really have an opinion on the originating laptop dropped off for repair, but I suspect that the leak was inevitable because Hunter Biden's accounts were already compromised by run-of-the-mill Internet investigators. The flood gate was already opened. From where I sat, I was concerned the laptop repair story was exceedingly convenient. But, whatever.

In October 2020, the first drip occurred publicly. I was sent a mega link that is now expired, that contained some of the laptop material.

This was (approximately) the first sample I received. It is SFW and the most damning thing is evidence of a wire transfer from Chinese Intelligence asset to Hudson West III LLC. The rest was a bit random.

https://pic8.co/a/02bddee7-bdef-44ec-8cc4-0197cfad55e9/

Less than a week later, I was sent a much larger collection of images, this time with EXIF data and other corroborating information that showed the majority of what I was looking at was authentic.

We already know the emails and banking records are real per the FOIA request. A number of emails can also be verified with DKIM authentication and also by being able to see both sides of the conversation (like with Devon Archer's emails from his own account to and from Hunter Biden.)

>DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. This is done by giving the email a digital signature. This DKIM signature is a header that is added to the message and is secured with encryption.

https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/dkim/

This second, larger set of files included a massive amount of salacious content. The shills surrounding this controversy love to focus on Hunter Biden's genitals in order to distract from the corruption. Indeed, a file named Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 8.57.14 AM.png shows Hunter Biden with his wiener on a piece of pizza.

Many escorts were featured in this data dump and, unlike what was minimally reported on, their faces were visible and uncensored. I ran them all through facial recognition, right away, with mixed results. Indeed, they are mostly escorts but Hallie Biden and other friends, like Ashakai Grant, are also featured with Hunter Biden's wang.

In one of the pictures, Hunter Biden is with his computer where he is logged into PornHub account, RHEast, where he was uploading videos of him and Hallie and others engaged in sexual behavior.

Beau Biden, btw, seemed to be fully aware of this relationship between Hunter and Hallie, where Hunter sent him pictures of acts together. this is why many believe Natalie and or Hunter may be Hunter Biden's biological children.

At this stage, in 2020, the Q movement all but shut down. They had seemed to be waiting for something like this for years, they finally had it all... and the entire Q astroturfing movement completely shut down and Voat deleted itself from the Internet. This was very suspicious. The ""conservative"" news outlets refused to cover what was in the first set of leaks... which was only a portion of the ""hard drive.""

ZeroHedge, Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics... all these outlets I would have expected to jump all over this content... did absolutely nothing. In fact, they even participated in some light disinformation, in some cases.

I posit that the Q movement was a Carlysle Group psyop aided by numerous astroturfing firms like upvotes.club, but also by government contractors like CACI and... QinetiQ.

One concerning aspect of the Hunter Biden data that was available in 2020 was that it heavily featured Natalie Biden. Hunter Biden was in possession of hundreds of her personal pictures. It appeared obsessive.

Beyond the pictures, it became clear that many people were concerned about Hunter Biden's ""sexually inappropriate"" interactions where he is naked and smoking crack in front of Natalie Biden.

https://i.imgur.com/XPuBIaj.jpg

What is also concerning, is that, despite being banned from seeing her alone, Hunter Biden is still meeting in secret with Natalie in places like a Whole Foods bathroom. Natalie is on a family outing, then sneaks to the bathroom to meet Hunter Biden... to ""fold clothes.""

By mid 2021, it was clear many people had Hunter Biden data and the ""hard drive"" was repackaged in a variety of ways. With each repacking, data was taken and inserted. I gave up relying on these anonymous dumps and focused on how to verify what was important with the usual OSINT techniques.

Shills will always cry about source, verification and context, so it is important to pre-emptively give it to them to take away their crybaby ammunition.

Now that the issue has gained more steam, you can actually peruse a lot of the emails, yourself.

https://bidenlaptopemails.com/

TMB files has started to gather data... albeit a bit haphazardly:

https://www.tmbfiles.com/search-files/

And the most reliable way to see the new leak is just by downloading the torrent, yourself, and opening in iPhone Backup Extractor.

[Magnet Link](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ba031f1b19eb501808b6145641ea1a49e41bb6bd&xt=urn:btmh:122056121502a7164ef4d04873e2794ffa218d5e0532a919a409bba3c6c7a7cd0eb3&dn=iphone_ipadBackup.zip&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fopen.stealth.si%3a80%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fexodus.desync.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.torrent.eu.org%3a451%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.tiny-vps.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fopentracker.i2p.rocks%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fipv4.tracker.harry.lu%3a80%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2f9.rarbg.com%3a2810%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fwww.torrent.eu.org%3a451%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fopentracker.i2p.rocks%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=https%3a%2f%2fopentracker.i2p.rocks%3a443%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3a80%2fannounce)

So, now, here we are again, when every conservative news outlet should be screaming this stuff from the rooftops, but it seems nearly all Hunter Biden posts are getting deleted on all sites, even 4chan, especially Reddit, Twitter is banning people constantly over it... The Q tards are eerily silent.

In short, there is 100% proof of criminality of a variety of types, showing that the Bidens are above the law and will destroy your country for pennies on the dollar.

Hunter Biden will sell out billions of American resources for crack and hookers. He must be stopped. This behavior is ongoing.

Now the disease Smallpox was considered eradicated in the 1980s. Only 2 countries in the world hold a sample, one being the USA According to pop science however this disease is easily relocatable in a lab, or even using items from E-Bay (Im sure you all saw that story a few years back).
All this begs the question as to why the FDA approved a Smallpox vaccine in 2019 and a new drug to treat it just this year.

I believe this may be the first of several LEGITIMATE mass-casualty events that take place. Something is coming this winter. With the majority of people they want left after a cataclysm possibly infertile from the new vaccine, now you can start the mass die off with a controlled smallpox outbreak. The systems for border control, contact tracing, camps and hospitals for infected patients, mass vaccine production and distribution and vaccine tracking are already set up and now we have a real excuse for the use of them when a lethal virus is released. Smallpox will already be hard to deal with in a first world country, and the people that say the vaccine is damaging point to the third world and say wouldn't the NWO want to get rid of them first. The third world would be wiped out with a manufactured smallpox virus, would bring the world to that 500,000,000 number in the guidestone, I would say they want us at atleast less than a billion people. All that are left are just smart enough people that they can enslave, that are also infertile in large numbers from these new vaccines. But thats another story in itself.

They will ease up restrictions on COVID and people will start thinking its already over, or even if your country doesn't do that they will let the vaccinated move freely. They will release smallpox during Christmas, its probably starting right now or very soon so it starts spreading just before people move nationally and internationally for holiday celebrations. Just like C-19 it will released so that it would spreading endemically before Christmas so it becomes pandemic, although

""The U.S. and other Western nations were ordering “COVID”-specific test kits and supplies by a name that technically wouldn’t exist until 11 Feb 20, when the WHO/CDC cohort would officially apply the “COVID-19” moniker to it. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that the U.S. and those other nations were making such “COVID-19” purchases dating back to 2017 and in each and every year up to 2019. How does that happen outside of a planned event?""

Soon it will be announced that it was a leaked virus from wuhan. Then months later it will be announced it was an experimental bioweapon. Just watch.

Every single one of these people that were involved with hiding information, covering up information and lying need to be held accountable. There’s a lot of blood on their hands. They need to be brought into the spot light and tell who, what, where and when. Punishment should be swift, severe and final. Crimes against humanity.

It wasn't accidental -- remember Pelosi was waiting for something to happen before she delivered the first fake 'peachmint to the senate.

And we can't get mad at China. I've had people tell me they want to see China get nuked for this. No, the people of China have more reason to hate the CCP than we do.

Does anyone else remember how this all started? Forgive me for any timeline errors about this but Trust me worth the read.   I'd love to hear others opinions and discussion on the topics below.

I would say I have been a life long conspiracy fan and could hold my own discussing any conspiracy from the moon landing, JFK, Illuminati, Bill Cooper, Atlantis, Flat earth, Hollow earth, Big foot, Aliens, Ancient aliens, Nephilim ,Giants, Niberu, Mayan calendar 2012 end of the world, Age of Aquarius, Theosophy, Maitra,  Manhattan project, Alex Jones, Area 51,  Mk ultra, Majestic 12, Project mocking bird, Gulf of Tokin, The Bushes all the way back to Prescot,  Holocaust didn’t happen, 911, Stanely Kubrick hidden messages, Obama is the antichrist,  Yes we can= thank you satan backwards, Georgia Guide stones, Denver airport, Clinton death count, Clinton Foundation, Haiti, Operation Northwoods, Satanic backmasking in music, Subliminal messages in media and Disney, Elite child abuse, Ritual sacrifice,  Skull and Bones,  Free masons, Cern, Chemtrails, Reptilian overlords from Zeta Reticuli, Moon Nazis, Pizza Gate,  I mean I literally went down every rabbit hole the internet had to offer. My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

Post your best conspiracy theories. Here’s mine:

In 2015 there was a test done at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It was headed by Ralph Baric.

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502

The purpose of the lab test was to manipulate a bat coronavirus to see if it could infect humans. It was discovered that it could.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

One of the people who co wrote the paper was a Chinese researcher by the name of Xing-Ye Gi. Google scholar shows Gi has written or co-written numerous papers on SARS, ebola and coronavirus.

https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&num=10&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=%22Xing-Yi+Ge%22&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&as_allsubj=all&hl=en

Gi works in Wuhan, within the sole BSL-4 lab in the entire country. A Chinese national literally worked on modifying a bat coronavirus to infect humans, 100% confirmed. Hmm...

There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists. Coincidentally, it happens to be in Wuhan. The people in Wuhan aren’t the only Chinese eating stuff like bat soup, this would have to be a pretty crazy coincidence since there are at least 9 cities larger than Wuhan and it could have appeared in any one of them, but it just happened to appear next to the sole bioweapon lab in the entire country.

https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487

This article was written in 2017 about its construction, and was worried about the potential safety since this is China’s first attempt at such a lab, and it wasn’t receiving guidance from the rest of the world on its construction. The article also mentions one of the first viruses it will be working on is SARS. The Coronavirus is closely related to SARs from initial inspection. The article warned that this lab would likely be dual use, as China claims it only exists to help research and cure disease when in reality China also wants to get in the Bioweapon game with the other superpowers.

A Bioweapon escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat, and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice in 2004!

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/sars-escaped-beijing-lab-twice-50137

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

Now to speculate. I don’t think it is a completed bioweapon as China would likely have a vaccine ready for it to protect their people after deployment against an enemy, and it would likely be far more dangerous. Much more likely is that it is an only partially completed bioweapon, a chimera SARS with aspects of other viruses thrown in as they experimented with creating the final product. This is what leaked. Since it is only an early prototype, there is no vaccine ready yet, and it will still be far more dangerous than a natural virus. This is also a huge reason for the coverup. If it gets out that China let a bioweapon escape, there will be an international shitshow. Unlike what other conspiracy theorists have speculated, I find it extremely doubtful that a bioweapon was released deliberately, as there is no believeable motive and this will inflict terrible damage on China economically.

His profile suggests he deals with money so of course his first post on November 7th is in r/wallstreetbets. But after that zero posts and comments for months. Sounds like a typical cover to disguise who he really is. I mean not even one post or comment after that? Come on. 

Then once official news broke of the virus on January 20th he rushed and immediately created multiple communities such as r/China_Flu and r/coronavirus as if he already had this all planned. As people joined and posted he suppressed information heavily as you can tell because all of his comments are telling people why a post is being removed. Pretty much anything showing negative things about China is removed. 

My guess is that he is working for the CCP, probably works for them full time and they had this plan all along. His goal was to come into reddit disguised as a normal user and then to create communities that everyone would join that the CCP could control. He must not have a day job because he moderates 24/7. 

If they control those communities, then they control the information that most of the reddit users talking about the virus have. 

When I posted in r/coronavirus complaining about the heavy censorship on the thread and asking others to join my community the post was removed and I was permanently banned without reason. 

He also immediately rushed and made r/COVID19 today almost instantly once the WHO released the name. China is working hard to control the information and so far because of this well...they’re winning.

Nobel Prize winner of 2018, Japanese physician, scientist and immunologist, Dr Tasuku Honjo, caused a sensation today in the media by saying that the corona virus is not natural.  
If it is natural, it will not have affected the whole world like that.  
Because, depending on the nature, the temperature is different in different countries.  
If it were natural, it would only have affected countries with the same temperature as China.  instead, it spreads to a country like Switzerland, the same way it spreads to desert areas.  whereas if it were natural, it would have spread in cold places, but would have died in hot places.  I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses.  
It is not natural.  
It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial.  
I have been working for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China.  
I know all the staff of this laboratory well.  
I called them all after the Corona accident but, all of their phones have been dead for 3 months.  
It is now understood that all of these laboratory technicians are dead.

Based on all of my knowledge and research to date, I can say this with 100 % confidence that Corona is not natural.  
It did not come from bats.  
China made it.  
If what I say today turns out to be false now or even after I die, the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize.  
But China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to all.

Don't take my word for any of this, fact check everything. Use multiple sources, filter results to exclude 2020 to drown out a lot of the noise if need be.

I never ask anyone to share anything, but if you would not mind sharing this one, please do, and yes, it is original content.

There are violent revolutions and well-funded protests occurring parallel to a novel pandemic with unprecedented countermeasures around the world.

A man shot 20 some people and we reformed gun laws within 2 weeks, a month later an independent nonpolitically aligned media (MacLean’s) publishes an article that it is very likely the killer (who was dressed as a police officer, in a police car) was likely an RCMP agent, the evidence is actual video footage of said individual going to a Brinks chartered bank and withdrawing (not stealing) $490,000\~ dollars in physical cash.

meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter are moderating the US President, or anyone against the Hong Kong movement, in parallel. Hidden 

Camera footage gets released showing the Facebook ‘Community Moderation Team’ admitting to moderating anything that is against their viewpoint and being lenient to anything that is against their terms, but pro their viewpoint.

Real-time video, actual live video, is showing me things, the news is then reframing in front of my eyes, both sides of the news, as completely different things. Of course, each ‘side’ spins its own narrative, both deviate from the thing I watched with 2000 people happen in real-time.

The WHO / CDC / world health organizations have released conflicting information more times than I can count at this point. Not conflicting in the sense that naturally, science evolves, and new information comes to light, but even things we already knew made sense to be told don’t make sense to then be told make sense again (Looking at you Facemasks)

A vaccine is being purposed by Bill Gates inside of 12 months, Bill Gates is not a medical professional, and a vaccine has never been made that fast in the history of man, nor is it recommended a vaccine be made that fast for what I assumed were obvious reasons. (Just to clarify, I got a vaccine six months ago after a meat scare at a deli when I went home for Christmas, I am in no way shape or form ‘Anti-Vaxx’ but if I am brave enough to question this in a public forum, that is what you assume)

The world economy is crashing, joblessness all-time high, governments printing money in buckets for social assistance inflating the currency. This is not localized; this is a global occurrence. New studies are being released showing the income disparity of people has shifted quite suddenly since the beginning of Sars-CoV-2, and not in the way we were hoping it shifts.  


It was 34 degrees outside today, 2 days ago was the first day of summer.

Australia gets hit by a state-sponsored cyber-attack (suspected China), PM gives a national address on getting hacked, never saw that before, the Australian intelligence community releases statement ‘They were going for the crown jewels’  


Four months in the house, I still do not know anyone who has even contracted CVOID, asked over 1000 personally, personally asked them, have a \*redacted\*, over 20 years, \*redacted\* joke about it being a fake virus.

DR. Fauci admits, hands down admitted the government intentionally mislead the people about facemasks to assure availability for health care workers

Five pharmacies out here personally told me; our \*redacted\* population bought all the facemasks early February.

COVID 19, which statistically kills minorities in the black and Spanish population the most, is somehow not killing any of the people in the live streams I have been watching for over 3 weeks, not one person has contracted it in the community of 'CHAZ/COP'

COVID 19, which has a zero-immunity factor in our current society, should be expanding exponentially. In most of the world, it has shown linear growth. All statistical models were entirely off, all of them off in a direction that justified society locking down, the same politicians were telling you if you visited your grandma, they would die, but also telling you, if you were outside yelling (a great way to spread droplets) you were doing your civic duty.

1000 health care professionals signed a statement saying COVID 19 should not hinder civil protesting, two weeks previously, they said to stay home save lives. 

No one is saying racism does not exist, no one is saying black lives don’t matter, people are being fired from jobs for saying all lives also matter, no one is disagreeing what happened to George Floyd was not murder, everyone agrees the people responsible in that incident should be prosecuted, multiple weeks of protests, during a pandemic.

During the lockdown, neighbors who were friends for years starting calling the police on each other, over COVID concerns, these same people a week later are posting #defundThePolice

There is an autonomous/occupied zone in Seattle, the mayor called it a summer of love, I have watched people get shot 3 nights in a row, live, on a platform I used to watch people play video games on.

New York Mayor sends infected COVID 19 patients to retirement homes, massive deaths in elderly, only 1 field hospital built ever saw a patient, the ship was never utilized, the president was blamed?

I am watching people post memes about being sorry for racism who have never been racist, I am watching guys I know from my old life who sold drugs to Sixteen-year-old girls, sometimes for sexual favors (they were 18), calling people racist on Facebook, and no one is saying anything about it.

This list is probably not even 50% completed, and tomorrow there will be entirely new things to add to the burning tire fire of 2020. No one individual can even keep up with all this without mentally exhausting themselves (did I mention it was 32 degrees outside).

That is not even the worst part,

the worst part is I see someone I have respected for years, and they are not even willing to acknowledge any of these things, and give generic answers like, 'don’t believe what you read on the Interwebs, as if I would ever, ever, ever, make my mind up without qualifying various sources unless of course, there is literal unedited footage of the said event.

Addendums:

\- Contract tracers in the states, tasked with finding out who someone that has been confirmed with COVID has been around, are not allowed to ask if they attended protests, in fear they won't come in to get tested

Over the past few days, I have spent a lot of time researching and compiling the best information we have on COVID-19 all in one post. Here, I am going to definitively prove to the many doubters from last time why COVID-19 is the worst novel virus we have seen in a century. This is a long post, and I won’t be providing a tl;dr because you need to know all the facts. Additionally, I have taken out all of the speculation I had from last post, and am just going to stick to the facts.

Alright, let’s get into it.

First, I will **debunk** the most common argument that COVID-19 is essentially just the flu. It is FAR worse than the flu or any other recent novel outbreak, and here's why:

1. Coronavirus is roughly [20x deadlier than the flu](https://www.ccn.com/coronavirus-is-20x-deadlier-than-the-flu-shocking-new-data-reveals/) according to current numbers with a roughly 2% mortality rate. I will say, I think it’s lower due to the overall lack of data, but isolated cases like the diamond princess are showing us it is pretty close. If hospitals get overrun, this number gets much much higher due to the lack of care for critically ill patients.
2. R-naught is how many people will get infected on average by one person. Coronavirus is extremely contagious with an r-naught of 4-6.7 according to this [Los Alamos preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1) (a very highly regarded research center). For reference, seasonal flu is about [1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186370). This means that unchecked, the coronavirus is about 3x more contagious than the seasonal flu. There have been [superspreaders](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-superspreader-south-korea-church.html) that have done immense damage all by themselves. Here is a worrying [comparison graph](https://twitter.com/farhangnamdar/status/1230554753182003203?s=21) showing COVID19 in relation to other recent outbreaks like SARS, Ebola, and MERS.
3. It is not necessarily the mortality rate that we need to be worried about, but a combination of both mortality and infection rate. The Spanish flu was just a very severe flu (also about 2% mortality rate, sound familiar?), but it managed to kill at least 50 million because it infected [so many people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) 
4. The vast majority of governments including the US have been quarantining people for 14 days, but there have been [many cases confirmed](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/) to have longer incubation periods; some up to 27 days. Additionally, there is new evidence that people can get [reinfected](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/02/21/COVID-19-reinfection-cases-on-the-rise-in-China/4291582219521/). Patients have been slipping through the cracks of quarantines all over the world, and we are finally starting to find out. 21 different countries confirmed a new case of coronavirus on Tuesday.

**So how does it actually stack up against past viruses?**

Ok, so I have more than proven that coronavirus is much more deadly and much more infectious than the seasonal flu, glad to get that out of the way. SARS, Ebola, and MERS were more deadly but WAY less infectious. But OP, there were other flus that [killed a couple million](https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/), what about those? Well yes, but they were only a couple times deadlier than the regular flu (instead of 20x like COVID-19) and I can't find anything about mass quarantines or supply chain disruption. They were essentially just deadlier flu seasons.

A big factor in this is that COVID-19 carriers can be highly infectious [without showing any symptoms](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-confirmed-patients-can-transmit-the-coronavirus-without-showing-symptoms). For obvious reasons, this and the insufficient 14-day quarantine standard makes containment damn near impossible. In fact, officials are saying it is beyond containment.

[All COVID-19 confirmed statistics](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

* keep in mind that these are only people that have been tested and confirmed. China doesn’t even count those who die in their homes and were never explicitly confirmed.  And they especially don't waste tests on those with very mild symptoms. Take these as ***very conservative*** numbers.
* China especially [doesn’t have the facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI0XWAMQgxc) to test all those that are asymptomatic or not very ill, nor do they classify undiagnosed deaths/illnesses as COVID-19 illnesses.
* Thailand, Iran, Indonesia, Turkey, the US, China, pick a country. Many are either hiding their numbers or have no clue what is going on. Many countries are not [publishing their numbers](https://twitter.com/farnazfassihi/status/1232016362178072581?s=20), not being forthcoming with the facts. Is this getting old yet? The confirmed statistics are nowhere near the real statistics.

**Look at what they do, not what they say.**

China’s carbon emissions have massively [dropped](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-china-co2-climate-crisis-greenhouse-gas-carbon-emissions-coal-a9351436.html?amp). The Hubei province hasn't been working, and people have been [welded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meRUCxlleUc) inside their homes. Do you want to know how these people feel? Listen to the [sounds](https://youtu.be/opFCAWZHpzg) coming from Wuhan residential buildings at night. Admittedly, most of these people are probably just frustrated/bored, and succumbing to [cabin fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_fever), but it is unsettling enough to include. The good news, however, according to the traffic on a popular Chinese social media app (Weibo), is that China's draconian quarantine measures [might actually be working](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f82lq9/signs_that_infection_is_slowing_in_wuhan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Additionally, China is slowly [going back to work.](https://www.ft.com/content/b7abf464-5791-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc) The problem is, once China goes back to work the virus will inevitably experience a resurgence when people leave quarantine. Herein lies the problem; it's not going away, and the economy can't wait for it to pass. I look forward to a study showing if the virus can survive the heat, but there is no definitive evidence for this possibility at the moment.

I implore you to look not at what governments are saying, and instead what they are doing. There have [never been quarantines of this scale](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/01/china-quarantine-coronavirus/605455/) in the history of the world. Do you think China would spend all this money on hospitals, incinerators, containment, and damage mitigation over the flu? For anyone that really wants to get into the nitty-gritty on the effects on the global market, u/Fwoggie2 has been creating incredibly detailed daily updates over on r/supplychain. Seriously, he demonstrates the economic effects better than I could.

**Why is the WHO** [**the way that they are**](https://media.giphy.com/media/hyMFaxhuQkZTq/giphy.gif)**?**

* Coronavirus meets all the [criteria of a ](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/phase/en/)[pandemic](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/phase/en/), yet the WHO has not declared it as such. Turns out, the WHO [no longer uses](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-who/who-says-no-longer-uses-pandemic-category-but-virus-still-emergency-idUSKCN20I0N8) these criteria. There are many theories as to [why](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/425m-in-world-bank-catastrophe-bonds-set-to-default-if-coronavirus-declared-a-pandemic-by-june?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) they have not announced a pandemic, but due to the nature/attempted honesty of this post, I will not go into them. The fact is, COVID-19 is categorically a pandemic, and many experts agree ([one of many examples](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-in-all-but-name-says-expert)).

**Conclusion**

Anyone who still believes this is just a different flu and not the largest pandemic we've seen in a century is falling victim to [normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias). It's very common and happens to everyone in different ways. The fact is, the numbers are far worse than anything we've seen in the past, governments are panicking, and financial effects are finally showing. The NYSE is still falling, even today. The novel coronavirus is way more deadly, and way more infectious than anything we have seen in a long time. And since there isn't a world war taking the attention away from it like with the Spanish flu, we need to be worried about economic fallout.

What can the individual do about this?

* Nothing, really. Don't go to mass gatherings if the virus is present in your area. Prep with food and sanitization, and masks. Wait for a vaccine or effective treatment. The classic stuff.
* Don't panic. Business-as-usual is the key to mitigating this thing and creating the best outcome for all. Don't pull stocks, they always bounce back eventually; those who held on in 2008 eventually saw their profits come back. Same situation here. Don't overbuy food and participate in causing shortages.
* The difference between now and pandemics of the past is the fact that the world is globalized. The economic fallout from this has far worse *potential* than we've ever seen or experienced in history. This is why the WHO is so vague and why the CDC ""isn't testing"". You can't confirm community level spread if you aren't testing for it.",conspiracy,Wuhan

The purpose of this project is explained on their website as, “The Center’s SPARS Pandemic exercise narrative comprises a futuristic scenario that illustrates communication dilemmas concerning medical countermeasures (MCMs) that could plausibly emerge in the not-so-distant future. Its purpose is to prompt users, both individually and in discussion with others, to imagine the dynamic and oftentimes conflicted circumstances in which communication around emergency MCM development, distribution, and uptake takes place. While engaged with a rigorous simulated health emergency, scenario readers have the opportunity to mentally “rehearse” responses while also weighing the implications of their actions. At the same time, readers have a chance to consider what potential measures implemented in today’s environment might avert comparable communication dilemmas or classes of dilemmas in the future.
The self-guided exercise scenario for public health communicators and risk communication researchers covers a raft of themes and associated dilemmas in risk communications, rumor control, interagency message coordination and consistency, issue management, proactive and reactive media relations, cultural competency, and ethical concerns.”

From small to big details, including how things were handled within the media, with public health officials and those in government, the exact narratives of these people and how it screwed people’s perception of the virus/treatments/vaccines, things that took place in politics, the controversy of antiviral medications, the controversies that would arise with the vaccine role out, ETC ETC!! 
Everything that was prewritten has played out almost identically to this so called “potential futuristic SPARS pandemic scenario”.  The names used and the names of the vaccine and medications are obviously made up, but you can literally tell who’s who and what medication they are talking about cause it’s so identical to what has happened since December 2019. It also explains what’s gonna happen in the near future for the vaccinated people and how it is going to affect how we trust the media and pharmaceutical companies, and how the truth about these vaccines is gonna come out and those that have been pushing it are going to be exposed.   

You ALL gotta read this and share it.

Please stop wearing gloves, wearing gloves all day actually spreads disease more. (But masks don't?) 2019

People can spread covid without ever getting sick or knowing they have it-2019 (this is important)

2020: no we arent overmarking covid deaths!

2020 the fastest developed vaccine in human history beating the second fastest by 9 and a half years is out! Go get it.

Even if you're not worried about covid yourself you should get it to protect to others! 2020 (this is why almost everybody got it)

Yes the johnson and johnson is causing blodclots but the odds of getting that side effect arent any worse than any other vaccine! 2020( some may have missed the hidden truth in this one)

2021 no the vaccine doesnt actually cure covid, or or prevent catching it, but your symptoms will be less severe. ( but you can still spread it to others)

2021 yes we over marked covid deaths because theres no way of knowing how much or how little covid contributed to someone's death so if they were positive at all it counts as comorbidity and a covid death!

2021 covid started in a Wuhan virus lab

2021 dramatic increase in heart issues with young people, oh well.

2021 0 recorded flu deaths! It's because of masks!

2022 the defintion of the term herd immunity changed to say only when people are vaccinated instead of when a disease runs its course and natural immunity/resistance is developed.

2022 womens menstrual cycles are changing dramatically and young people have a dramatic increase in heart issues. Weird!

2022 80% of the country is vaccinated but then death rates arent going down! Only the unvaccinated are dying though (ignore how it's possible the rates are far greater than prevaccination)

2022 we dont want to release Pfizer's data because it will make them look bad

2022 Pfizer's data states it was barely tested, isnt even a covid protein, didnt work at all, and hundreds of people died within days or weeks after the vaccine

2022: okay the vaccine doesnt prevent infection or spreading, or deaths, but your far less likely to die from covid because we said so.

2022: the isolation precautions of being unvaccinated and vaccinated are now exactly the same

&nbsp;

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 and December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China and with potential to destablize and perhaps even motive to collapse China from within.

&nbsp;

US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage vs China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and the BRI relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible denialability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermnonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blow back. 

&nbsp;

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping XI/CCP would kowtow to etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""new american century"") the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives  and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worse possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.  

&nbsp;

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devasting is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people. 

&nbsp;

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host Steve Bannon (Trump chief campaign advisor) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the Xi/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

&nbsp;

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasin population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantinee and lockdowns of cities of unprecendeted porportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damaage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

&nbsp;

Even the SARS of 2003 had an negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and has already turned out to be far worse and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsuprisingly without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilsts at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak. 

&nbsp;

China should at least stay vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends.. Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and pysops war, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened.

&nbsp;

Steve Bannon was hoping to ""break the back of the CCP"" by cutting off China's supply chain, and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change.

&nbsp;

I'm sure both China and US have their own red lines. If the US had any involvement in this new virus, if China finds any credible evidence, then there are a number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon... for example, we all know the Trade War is not about trade, but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise... for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS, making a move that would seal the US fate as the ""falling empire"". If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region, so China can declare ADIZ over SCS, America would be pushed back to Guam, and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony (which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster)

&nbsp;

Some have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles. And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill/contain. But I believe in this case it is about maintaining ""plausible deniability"" whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future. A virus outbreak that dings China's GDP by 2 to 5 % in 2020 is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out 90% of the Chinese population, for example. Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China's central Wuhan, naturally China has a self interest in containment, and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China. It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it. Hence ""mission accomplished"" with little attribution and minimal blowback. What better way to undermine China/CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government!? Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn't for eating rats, bats, dogs, etc this wouldn't ever have befallen. Perfect cover for re-enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China, and that of Chinese culture, and Chinese ideology on the world stage.

&nbsp;

All of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides's Trap. For various reason, biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages, hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China. At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans? History has shown that America is willing to wipe out entire Han civilization to maintain american hegemony and regain full spectrum dominance and supremacy.

&nbsp;

Kissinger is credited for giving Nixon the idea to open up China. It appears as the 45 year rapprochement comes to a sudden close, the US has regretted the long term decision. When viewed threw the lens of optimization of entropy maximization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics it is all about the counterbalance needed to an unchallenged US uni-polar scheme that impedes the progress and destiny of a universe in evolution.

&nbsp;

Steve Bannon was quoted to say that it is Ten times more important for the US to kill Huawei than it is for Trump to sign any trade deal. USA realizes that China will soon surpass them if status quo isn't changed. The true motive of the trade war is to decouple the US from China quickly enough to asymmetrically target and destroy any tip of the spear Chinese companies/projects/tech such as the Huawei, 5G, DJI, EV, trains, Cancer research, TikTok, SenseTime, etc etc to cripple China's plans to move up the value chain and hi-tech-ify its economy and to do so with enough force to set back China and permanently prevent it from successfully climbing the arch trajectory of replacing the US. For the US it’s not just about losing the top spot to China, if America were to ever lose its petrodollar hegemony it would collapse in much the same way as happened to the USSR. The whole US empire is built on house of cards, ever since Brentwood they got away with taxing/usurping the world using the dollar as economic weaponization through 'quantitative easing' and its military to control OPEC to sustain the petrodollar hegemony. In the 1980's Japan became a threat to the US so they forced Tokyo to acquiesce to the Plaza Accord resulting in the ""lost four decades"" and Japan never recovering. Nowadays Trump, Steve Bannon, Pompeo and other Hawks are trying to impose the same sort of colonization on China, but much harder to do since China doesn't entertain US troops/US bases unlike the Japanese vassal so the next best thing is to subvert Hong Kong by way of CIA/NED and other propaganda techniques. And which nation killed a million civilians in Iraq after a false flag event and a WMD pretext but now is banning Chinese AI startups ostensibly because they care about the human rights of Muslims in China's internal Xinjiang region?

&nbsp;

This is all part of the bigger picture to contain China's continued rise, as we see that if the US ever lost its hegemony it would be game over... America views Chinese ambitions such as Made In China 2025, One Belt One Road, 5G, AI, etc as existential threats to its very lifestyle and way of life, hence the whole ""Huawei is a national security issue"" stance... Now even TikTok, a dancing video app, has become a ""national security"" threat and targeted and singled out by the US Congress. By ""national security"" they really mean China is offering the world a better deal and they are pissed that they are being undercut and view Chinese success as a direct threat to American hegemony. The West had its chance to help out Africa but did nothing, now China wants to help them develop and US is getting resentful, the supreme irony is accusing China of predatory lending. This will only get much worse, Xi predicted this will last a period of 30 years until which time China has become the undisputed Number One in the world economically, technologically, politically and militaristically. As the declining power the US isn’t going to just go down without fighting..... Just like the Roma Empire, as the US declines on the way down the lip service of freedom, democracy, etc stops and the true colors of the ugly side all comes out, they just did another coup in Bolivia after China signed a lithium deal to secure development of batteries for EVs, and now US is even sanctioning its own ""allies"" like Germany for daring to buy energy from Russia (NordStream 2, etc)...

&nbsp;

Like others have already brought to light and mentioned, with the multiple initial sources surrounding this Wuhan virus, it makes ""intentionally starting a pandemic with a bioweapon"" scenario much more likely. The virus failed to spread with the first group of targets, so they tried again with the market.

&nbsp;

For those who refuse to believe the US could ever be morally capable of doing such a coordinated strike and biological attack on mainland China, even if you do not at all believe US had anything to do with it, and even if US in reality had nothing to do with it, it still doesn't change the fact that this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance; and we already have evidence from US such as Wilber Ross etc willing to take full advantage of the situation. China must be prepared to adapt and adjust to this fluid situation as well, short term and as well as long term. This thing could very well politically isolate China (it is already having such an effect) and crater China's GDP, and most importantly strategically pressure China to give up its long term development aspirations and also to sign away certain concessions (give up on MIC2025 etc) right at the most critical moment in history.

&nbsp;

Sure we understand that the flu killed already 10000 US person this year alone, I also know the numbers in terms of how many up to 80,000 die of flu alone last year. And yes some of the hysteria and panic of this Wuhan thing may cause more damage than good at this point, sometimes the fear is more than just the virus damage itself.

&nbsp;

Having said that, on the other hand, the facts are this banning of all flights from China to the US, the enactment of the quarantine is described by the US CDC itself as the heaviest action it has taken in 50 years. Indeed when was the last time Russia closed its borders to China? When was the last time Disney shutdown, and all these hundreds of other things shutting down in China and all the countries closing their door to China? Precisely my point regardless of whether or not the real or percieved threat of this virus is overblown or not, the fact is the reaction to it has already greatly harmed China substantitively at what could be argued as the worst possible timing... so yes, this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance.

&nbsp;

The fact of the matter is the rest of the world isn't closing its flights and borders to the USA, despite the flu in the US killing way more people, but the world is closing its doors to China... This cannot be good no matter how it is spun. I'm concerned this will be the point of inflection in which the tide permanently turns and China regresses back to being closed, isolated country and America pulled the supply chain rung under China's feet while China is down/ill and then convinences the rest of the world to a new Brentwoods to basically maintain US hegemony for the next 100 years. Perhaps this is what Trump was secretly hinting at when he gleefully announced at Davos that ""now is the time for renewed and great optimism""... Maybe he was hinting at world events to come that will greatly benefit America at the direct expense of China, events that by the time he made the speech at Davos would have already been put in place by the CIA. 

&nbsp;

If America has declared war on China, --(first by economic decoupling via sanctions and tariffs then by trying to kill off Chinese technology ascension by attempting to cut off China's tech supply chain, and finally by covert biowarfare to destroy China's food supply and then poision the Chinese people with a sinister virus in hopes of destablizing the entire country,)-- etc and by all appearances it has, with Pompeo openly stating that the Chinese CCP was the ""central threat of our times"", and Bannon calling for Trump to ""takedown Xi"" and ""break the spirit and crack the back of the Chinese people"", then it behooves China to defend itself and its citizens and interests appropriately. 

&nbsp;

This information better be spread across Chinese media so that the average Chinese develops a healthy and warranted suspicion of certain nations that have taken it upon themselves to stop at nothing to destroy the Chinese way of life and to destroy China's development and progress. Making more mainland Chinese aware of the underlining truth that all of China is constantly being targeted with warfare of all categories and at all levels by everything American cannot possibly be a bad thing. America has been applying every kind of means of warfare that exists under the sun against China, against the Chinese government and against the Chinese people and their well-being; be it Trade War, Economic War, Proxy War (Taiwan, HK, etc), Tech War (Huawei/5G/AI/tiktok), Supply Chain War, CyberWar, Information propaganda Warfare (including the ""reverse conspiracy theory"" and other false flags), Biological Warfare and soon to be Conventional war and perhaps even someday Nuclear war. 

&nbsp;

The Chinese people for their own good should be more aware of the ideological war that America has inflicted upon the Chinese citizens both at home and abroad... The stark constrasting juxposition could not be more supremely ironic and hypocritical. Brain drain from the rest of the nations in the world to the US is called ""free market"" and labeled as ""freedom loving scientists going to work in open democractic Universities with higher pay and better quality of life"" and yet this same notion of ""brain drain"" from the US to the rest of the world is called ""intellectual property theft"", ""spying"", or ""sending spies to steal 'American technology'"". For when as China or Russia or India jailed their scientists for working with US universities and earning US research grants. If they did that, immediately the US media will instantly accuse them of being ""totalitarian communist police state with no academic freedom"" etc.

&nbsp;

During China's moment of greatest need and vulnerability we see Westerners racism and xenophobia come out in full blossom from Universities that say it is normal to be xenophobia to so-called ""free speech"" newspapers that take delight in China's plight and openly incite hatred and racisms by publishing intentionally vile depictions of the Chinese people and the Chinese flag in order to kick China while it is down. 

&nbsp;

America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

Motive, means, and TIMING, all just too suspicious... in terms of the African Swine Flu that started attacking chinese pigs for the VERY FIRST TIME immediately after Trump started the Trade war in 2018 causing China to buy MORE Pork from the US at higher price/cost!

Then immediately after China signs the ""trade deal phase 1"" this wuhan virus happens, and US already saying they will bring jobs back and push china harder on phase 2!!!!

Then, on top of everything, bird flu happens in china too, and now chickens are going dead!

The timing is just too suspect, how come India and bunch of other dirty countries that eat bats and whatever never had outbreak?

Then they found out this virus only targets Chinese DNA!

""We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.""
""The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.”

The poster which made these predictions commented in this thread. 

I have included the archived links for reference for each comment, which certifies that this comments were made at their stated time and date. 

This poster begins by saying:

> No. I'm operative.

Following up on both of these statements, they go on to state in response to no particular comment (unprovoked, as if to get their most essential point across):

> Do not accept any vaccines that will be released for a deadly virus in the winter of 2020. 

[https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225499031](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225499031)

When asked about how the virus will appear, they state:

> It will originate from a pharmaceutical company working with military op's in a west coast state. It will be accurately planted in major cities and It will cause flue like symptoms and may be deadly to elders and babies but the media will report it as deadly for everyone but It's a hoax, the vaccine will be the real killer packed with copious amounts of toxic metals. 

[https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225499413](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225499413)

This comment is very accurate:

1. We know now that this is what happened. I believe it came from ""EcoHealth Alliance"", that funded the Wuhan lab (pharmaceutical company), in collaboration with DARPA (military op's).
2. We also know from spectrometry of the vaccine vials that heavy metals and metallic like substances have been found in the vaccines, as this poster predicted.
3. We know that the virus was not deadly for the vast majority of the population, but that the entire population was urged to get the vaccine, as this poster predicted.
4. We know that it broke out in major cities, all across the globe. Indeed, as if it were with pin point accuracy, as this poster predicted.
5. It caused flu like symptoms, as this poster predicted.

In response to the above, a poster then asks: "" So kind of like SARS; bird flu, swine flu?"", to which they reply:  


>I do not know any details on the actual genetics of the virus sorry. But I know they have tested It multiple times already but in different ""brand"" names 

[https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225500111](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/225497848/#225500111)

This again makes sense. They would have tested it to get the right mix of lethality / contagiousness before releasing it.

In total, they made 6 comments, 5 of which are relevant and shown above. One of their posts are a single word ("" TORILLE! :) "" ) and not relevant to the discussion.

My view on this is as follows:

1. I don't think this archive link is faked.
2. The comments this poster made were very accurate, and none of them were inaccurate. This leads me to believe that their posts are unlikely to be correct through sheer coincidence.
3. This leads me to believe that some people were in the know about COVID and the COVID vaccines before they were released. 
4. All the above is strong evidence that COVID and COVID-19 vaccines were purposefully released onto the population to cause harm.

Obviously, it goes without saying that you can make up your own mind about this. But in my opinion, this person knew something. It is too freakishly accurate.",conspiracy,Wuhan

There is reason why China lied about human to human transmission of Covid-19 https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/chinas-devastating-lies/.

What we are witnessing is coup. China and it's planned economy have completely subsumed America. China has sprung this virus on us and our response to it is being dictated by China via the WHO. We completely swallowed the bait and now we are hooked. 

If you are sitting around waiting for the corporate overlords to let us have our American way of life back, you are waiting in vain. The only way to get your way of life back is going to be to fight.

When a new virus is discovered the first goal is isolating the genome of the virus. Now 95% of the time this need to follow a set of guidelines called the Koch’s Postulates. They are as follows:

1)The bacteria must be present in every case of the disease.

2)The bacteria must be isolated from the host with the disease and grown in pure culture.

3)The specific disease must be reproduced when a pure culture of the bacteria is inoculated into a healthy susceptible host.

4)The bacteria must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host.

[https://www.medicinenet.com/kochs\_postulates/definition.htm](https://www.medicinenet.com/kochs_postulates/definition.htm)

Wuhan did a study where the scientists computer-generated the genome of the virus - this is what everyone bases their studies, tests, and everything off of. How do I know this? Because we keep seeing it repeatedly said throughout studies that there is an absence of a non-computer-generated model from January to July

""The complete genome for this SARS-CoV-2 was submitted to GISAID (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2020|EPI\_ISL\_402119),""  [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389v3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389v3)

""Virus isolation from the clinical specimens was performed with human airway epithelial cells and Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.... Although our study does not fulfill Koch’s postulates, our analyses provide evidence implicating 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092803/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092803/)

""We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988269/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988269/)

It would appear like they used cell culture that was derived from the kidneys of monkeys. ""Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines"". They may have done this to hide the virus' origin. They then submitted this to the WHO saying this was the isolation of the virus.

This conspiracy only requires the top brass at the WHO, the people who supplied the genomic sequence of Covid19, to be bribed outside of Chinese Communist Party members.

It actually appears every study that lists the source of genomic code is using this:

[https://virological.org/](https://virological.org/)

I need help looking into this further  


Edit: I'd like to point out a couple of points that have been brought up  


1) Even if the culture was acceptable, this still means that we are trusting the CCP on the isolation of the virus with science communities having few, I haven't found any, genomic sequence alternatives. I would prefer trusting someone else... y'know anyone other than the world leader in human rights abuses and censorship...

There are many thing in this report, but among other things I have found something that I believe should promptly be addressed, as it seems quite disturbing on first glance. It is the introduction of punishing people for merely upvoting content (in quarantined communities) that violates Reddit ""community guidelines"" (which we all know police far more than actual criminal posts and behaviour [which they mainly should], but go into the direction of wrong-think as well).

In this report, among other things, spez has unveiled that from now on:

>I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

> When we expanded our quarantine policy, we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.
> 
> Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behaviour across these communities.

There are many quarantined communities currently, including subreddits like r/911truth and the recent subs related to the coronavirus like /r/Wuhan_Flu .

 [Here is an incomplete list of quarantined subreddits, some of which have now been banned, like r/watchpeopledie](https://np.reddit.com/r/censorship/comments/9k6yuj/can_we_compile_a_list_of_quarantined_subreddits/e6wy0r0/), if anyone has a full list, please link it in the comments (this is the best I found).

I'm curious what your thoughts are on this issue? Punishing users for merely upvoting certain posts that are deemed ""wrong-think"" by Reddit?

I understand that there is a lot of hateful rhetoric on some of these subreddits, but are measures like this really useful? Is stamping out hate with censorships really helpful, or does it just promote the expansion of such extremism, but on other parts of the Internet, where people become trapped in self-referrential boxes?

Don't measures like this create a culture of fear and paranoia on Reddit where people might even be afraid to upvote something? Not to mention that people don't merely upvote things they agree with, but also to foster discussion on topics. 

This in itself is also quite a slippery slope - for punishing people for upvoting certain topics might move beyond just quarantined subreddits. Not to mention the fact that punishing users like this, in a very silent manner (invisible for most, unless the users speak out on another account that hasn't been banned, if their main account is banned), seems very troubling to me. That's why it might be useful to have this discussion now.

A user in the announcement thread ( u/valar_k )had a good take on this as well:

> An upvote is absolutely not an endorsement of the content. It just means you want it to be higher up in the comment sorting. You are supporting the comment insofar as you want it seen. For example I upvoted your comment because it is fostering discussion even though I disagree with you.
> 
> Forcing people to wonder whether they will be punished for expressing abstract sense of ""support"" or ""approval"" of content creates a chilling effect in which people start policing their own thoughts to participate in reddit.
> 
> It would be one thing if we were talking about sexually explicit material with minors or something similar. But this applies to things like swapping cigars, which was totally fine on reddit until recently. How close is a comment to a ""trade"" vs just talking about trading? Or the chapos getting their comments removed for celebrating John Brown. Or the former hydrohomies community. It's all subject to regional biases too, as you can shitpost and say ""America can go to hell"" without any consequences, but if you sarcastically say ""D***th to America"", which has the same meaning and intent in Farsi, it's removed and you possibly receive a ban. So now this means that you have to assume every comment you see will be interpreted literally by an American admin and take that into account when interacting with it.
> 
> It might seem like it is only a problem for political extremes on the left and right, but like I mentioned before, things that used to be ok like cigar and scotch swapping can become bannable overnight, and you need to keep up with that.

I also think that this virus, whether leaked from a lab or not, is dangerous, but only to unhealthy, compromised and old people, and that the vast majority of the population do not need this vaccine, and by forcing it on everyone they are killing and maiming healthy people, all in the name of money and control.

I also want to point out, for our American, Australian and Canadian friends, that where I live (UK) we have no vaccine mandates, we aren’t locked down, our hospitals are not crippled (because we haven't fired thousands of staff members during a global pandemic), the fact omicron isn’t dangerous is becoming widely accepted, there is talk of this all being over soon ([https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10409913/SAGE-adviser-hopes-UK-flu-type-relationship-Covid-2023.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10409913/SAGE-adviser-hopes-UK-flu-type-relationship-Covid-2023.html)) and our government is talking about only the old and vulnerable being vaxxed, which is how it should be. For some reason the American, Australian, French and Canadian governments (to name a few) seems to be ignoring this and continue to increase the fear and control. (as a side note I dont like my government either, but for some reason they are actually doing the right thing at the moment.)

In 1979, China introduced the One Child Policy to control the size of its rapidly growing population. This policy was abolished in 2015, and former *Wall Street Journal* reporter Mei Fong summarized the reasoning behind abolishing the policy as ""The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. **They have this huge crushing demographic crisis as a result of the one-child policy. And if people don't start having more children, they're going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population.""** Fong believed the huge retiree community must be supported, which would severely dampen China’s future growth.

Since the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of this population imbalance is expected to continue, as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which referred to a United Nations projections forecast that **""China will lose 67 million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.”** So it makes sense for China to create a disease that disproportionately affects the elderly.

**2. Trade War Retaliation**

The China-United States trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between the world's two largest national economies. In 2018, President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the intent of forcing it to amend what the U.S. claims are ""unfair trade practices.” Among those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China. **Since 2018, the United States has placed over $600 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.**

China has always seen itself as a world leader; however during the time frame starting from Donald Trump's inauguration until the first confirmed Coronavirus death on January 11th, 2020, the Shanghai SSE Composite Index lost 12% of its overall value, while the United States S&amp;P 500 gained 35%. China was losing its battle for economic supremacy and it's plausible that they wanted to even the score. Since the Coronavirus outbreak, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped as much as 35%, while the SSE has remained relatively steady. The West may have been hit harder from the virus because the three most internationally traveled nations are all located in Europe and North America. With free travel laws, more visitors, and decentralized governments it is much harder for Western Nations to contain an airborne pandemic. Additionally, China did not do its part to warn the rest of the world. Numerous intelligence agencies have stated that China has severely under-reported both deaths and cases. This underreporting is believed to have made other countries less prepared for this virus and helped contribute to its rapid spread across the rest of the globe.

**3. Information Theft**

Despite numerous US video-sharing apps that have been used for years such as Webex, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, and Skype, Zoom has recently taken over the video conferencing market share. **In fact, the two most downloaded apps since the COVID-19 outbreak are Zoom and the trending video app TikTok. Both are Chinese-run applications that have been linked to major security concerns and private data theft.**

Zoom has been banned by Google, NASA, Space X, the Taiwanese Government, the NYC public school district and the German Foreign Ministry. Space X cited “significant privacy and security concerns” and the German Foreign Ministry said that “security and data protection weaknesses made it too risky to use”. Zoom has been linked to stealing logins and passwords, harvesting data, leaking personal information, taking control of users’ microphones and cameras, allowing calls to be routed through whitelisted Chinese servers, call records remaining viewable on the web, and the ability to gain root access to a Mac OS.

TikTok has also amassed numerous concerns. According to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court, TikTok has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China. The lawsuit also accuses the company and its Chinese parent company ByteDance of taking user content such as draft videos without their consent and having ""ambiguous"" privacy policies. It raises concerns that data gathered by TikTok could be used to identify, profile and track users in the US. The company is benefiting from this alleged activity because it uses this data to sell targeted ads, the lawsuit alleges.

Furthermore, Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point has conducted research finding that TikTok has serious vulnerabilities that would have allowed hackers to manipulate user data and reveal personal information. TikTok admitted to some of these mistakes and paid a $5.7 million fine to the United States for stealing data related to children under 13. China has a long history of intellectual property theft, and they were able to enhance their capabilities and global reach during this virus. It seems that China was oddly prepared to capitalize on this pandemic.

**How they did it:**

What we know so far is that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China. **Additionally, China has only** **one** **Top Level-Four Microbiology Lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the National Biosafety Laboratory located in Wuhan.** The first-ever case of a coronavirus outbreak in humans was in 2003 when SARS was first discovered. Over two-thirds of SARS diagnosed cases came from China, making China the first-ever country to be majorly affected by a coronavirus. Prior to COVID-19, there have been less than 100 total diagnosed cases of human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) in the United States and Europe combined. Given the effects of SARS on China, in congruence with the rarity of the disease in the United States and Europe, it is not unreasonable to think that China has been studying coronaviruses more intently and for a longer period of time than any Western nation. In fact, just recently Western nations did not believe that masks helped against coronaviruses, while China has known otherwise for many years.

**Scientists believe that COVID-19 likely originated in a wet market, or natural environment, instead of a laboratory. This is because the RNA of the virus is thought to have been created through zoonotic spillover.** Zoonotic spillover is the transmission of a virus from a vertebrate animal to a human. Scientists believe COVID-19 started from a bat coronavirus which was presumably spread to a pangolin, and then to a human. This is not unique to COVID-19. It is believed that SARS’ inception was also through zoonotic spillover, from bats to civets to humans. MERS is also believed to have been created through zoonotic spillover, from bats to camels to humans.

Many scientists have pointed to zoonotic spillover as the reason COVID-19 started in nature instead of a laboratory. The issue with this argument is that zoonotic spillover does not necessitate mutual exclusivity from human intervention. **It is reasonable to believe that if a group of scientists wanted to spread a deadly coronavirus and cover it up, they would not manufacture a man-made coronavirus. Instead, they would take bats infected with coronavirus, put them in cages with other animals, and study the effects.** There have been many leaked photos from China of primates in cages undergoing inhumane tests in laboratories, so animal atrocities of this kind are neither unprecedented nor uncommon in China.

Although it is possible that COVID-19 could have started in nature, the majority of the world's bat population lives in South America and tropical climates. This makes it less likely that naturally spread coronaviruses would keep originating in China as opposed to elsewhere. **It is much more likely that the only microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the one at the epicenter of the virus outbreak, performed some sort of animal experiment that either intentionally or unintentionally spread outside the laboratory.**

If China didn’t manufacture the virus then they should have nothing to hide. **However, China has banned the publication of research into the origins of COVID-19 without government review and approval.** So much human knowledge could be gained from a world of scientists studying the origins of COVID-19 in order to prevent another pandemic. Instead, China is actively censoring the press and changing the facts. All of this leads me to believe that China manufactured the novel coronavirus and they are trying to cover up and control the narrative.

TL;DR - China has both political and financial motives to create a virus that affects the elderly and the West. China’s only laboratory that experiments with deadly coronaviruses is in Wuhan. With the knowledge that the last two coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, were caused through zoonotic spillover, China performed animal experiments to form a new disease. China has banned information about COVID-19 origins because they are trying to cover up and control the narrative.

**Update 8 hours after posting**: I just checked the news and multiple outlets are reporting that COVID-19 was created in a Wuhan Laboratory. I actually emailed this piece to three major news outlets this morning before posting on Reddit. One of those news sites, Fox News, posted a similar article 8 hours later. The current headline on their website reads, ""**Sources believe coronavirus originated in Wuhan lab as part of China's efforts to compete with US.""** Maybe it’s just a coincidence but either way this is wild!!!

I would like to share a personal story: In the 90 the parents of a friend bought their first personal computer. At the time it was seen as a novelty and because I was ""the geek"" they naturally asked me to help them set it up.

After everything was installed we had a quick discussion and h\*l\* f\*\*\* they were deep into conspiracy stuff. This was my first encounter with someone believing it. They  started to ask me all kind of weird questions. Like if it was possible for the government to listen to what they were saying in front of the machine, or if they could access their files and what was written in the text processor.

Now I was a stupid teenager, and I remember thinking they must be a bit ""\*\*\*\*\*"" and laughing. I dismissed their concern, tried to explain how it worked but to no avail. It went down the rabbit hole of the TV manipulating you, the moon landing and chem trails (who remember those :P). Back home out of curiosity I went on the Internet and OMG I found so many cool, crazy stuff like crop circles, weird alien conspiracies and other stuff. It was entertaining more than anything else.

Since then I kind always kept reading conspiracies mainly for fun, listening to coast to coast night show or Alex Jones renting about random things. **I remember him talking about how TV was fogging your mind, and once you see through it you could be free.** Every time I would read about those conspiracies I was thinking how can people believe this weird stuff. It doesn't make any sense. This went on until recently. **However slowly around me the world was changing**.

First I started to notice how much harder it became to search for authentic conspiracy theory websites. What used to be handmade blogs and forums now became almost impossible to find on Google or moved to walled garden like Facebook. This is when I realize there was a silent censorship campaign going on. No one cared, those are fringe ideas, however like a canary in a coal mine if we start censoring this, what is coming next? The Internet became more and more sanitized, void of what made it amazing at the start.

Fast forward in early 2020 when I started to share my concern about the pandemic in China, after they started to lock down and the fact that there is a f\*\*\* \* virology research lab dedicated to coronavirus in the middle of the city, I was placed into the category of crazy conspiracy trump supporter. **In a bitter twist, me who was laughing and all of those crazy people I finally joined them.**

Today, I'm not laughing anymore, so many of those crazy conspiracies are not even conspiracy anymore:

* Anything you write / do on a computer can and will be recorded.
* Almost all apps will record data and send it to some random cloud to be analyzed.
* Your human experience, emotion is constantly tracked by behavioral algorithm trying to predict what you are going to do next and try to sell you more stuff.
* Your health and some of your most private information is sold as if it was another commodity.
* You have 0 expectation of privacy on all major internet platforms. Almost all of them are US based (except in China which has its own issues regarding privacy).
* The mainstream media is lying almost on a daily basis. There is almost no true investigation journalism done anymore.
* Yes Alex Jones was right (I can't believe I'm writing this). TV makes you stupid.
* This was especially obvious during the pandemic and once you see through it you realized how f\*ck\*d up this whole thing is.

Recently after expressing some concern about the COVID vaccine (btw what is crazy is I'm pro vax for most other vaccine and even got some unusual ones due to my travels), I'm now put into the category of Antivaxxer.

In short in a bit more than a year and half I became labeled as:

* Trump supporter (Because I supported from beginning a full investigation on the Wuhan lab).
* Racist (I do not support CRT and got into mild trouble at my work for that).
* Doomsday Prepper (Because I bought some food in case of lockdown)
* Antivax (By just mentioning we should not vaccinate younger adult teens and children before knowing more about side effects).

**It is so scary how easily the world can change around you and suddenly you find yourself on the other side of the fence.** I'm also amazed by how easily people are manipulated, this really opened my mind, people love to think they would be part of the resistance against the totalitarian gov while in reality they would most likely support it.

The fact that people are cheering mandatory experimental vaccines is so wrong on so many levels and to be honest the future scares me.",conspiracy,Wuhan

I was told by some people from this sub to post any interesting discoveries.

&nbsp;

Credit to u/5nordehacedod for finding this. **Now to start the conspiracy:**

5 out of the 8 authors work at the Wuhan Institute for Virlogy, which is only 8 miles from the wet market. There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists: The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Here are some bits from the study:


“Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotyping

“Viral pseudotyping can also be very useful for studying emerging and highly pathogenic viruses. These viruses are often difficult for researchers to study because of the danger they pose. Pseudotypes can be made where the HIV envelope glycoprotein or the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein are replaced with the envelope from a highly pathogenic virus. These pseudotypes allow scientists to characterize the cellular tropism and entry determinants of otherwise challenging to study viruses”

This is important because yesterday a study was published suggesting that nCoV has bizarre HIV gene segments:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1

Here is the conclusion:

“Our analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date. To our surprise, all the 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV mapped to short segments of amino acids in the HIV-1 gp120 and Gag among all annotated virus proteins in the NCBI database. This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is **unlikely to be fortuitous**. Further, 3D modelling suggests that atleast 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site. Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation. Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.”

Fortuitous def:

“Happening by accident or chance rather than design.”

This study has since been withdrawn since it has not been peer review, but the HIV proteins they are talking about are the ones the Chinese scientists were working on.

&nbsp;

You may have also noticed the mention of ACE2 molecules. A study was published that Asian males are genetically much more vulnerable to nCoV due to their presence:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full

Here are the important parts:

""We further compared the characteristics of the donors and their ACE2 expressing patterns. No association was detected between the ACE2-expressing cell number and the age or smoking status of donors.
“Of note, the 2 male donors have a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than all other 6 female donors (1.66% vs. 0.41% of all cells, P value=0.07, Mann Whitney Test). In addition, the distribution of ACE2 is also more widespread in male donors than females: at least 5 different types of cells in male lung express this receptor, while only 2~4 types of cells in female lung express the receptor.”

“This result is highly consistent with the epidemic investigation showing that most of the confirmed 2019-nCov infected patients were men (30 vs. 11, by Jan 2, 2020).""

""We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.""

""The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.”

Look at those numbers.

&nbsp;

I have not deep dived the info and data in the original study, but I think it is worth a look and our posting and discussing it may have been what caused our mysterious quarantine. Don't let them memory hole this. Save and screenshot.

&nbsp;

A virus like this escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat (like bat soup), and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice in 2004!

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/sars-escaped-beijing-lab-twice-50137

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

As for why it hurts Asian males more? There could be a few reasons. Perhaps they were working on a race targeted weapon, and they only had Asian subjects to work on. Perhaps they were testing out ways to defend against such a race targeted virus from the U.S.

&nbsp;

EDIT:

As for reasons to deliberately release a virus that targets specifically Asian men? 

This could be one. In China, males outnumber females by 34 million people due to sex targeted abortions.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/too-many-men/

Many studies have shown that polygamy breeds civil war. Millions of angry single men who can't get a family or girlfriend.

https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/03/19/why-polygamy-breeds-civil-war

The PLA only has a ground force of 975,000 personnel.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army

They would be greatly outnumbered, and groups like the CIA would love to funnel in guns, IEDS, ATGMs, MANPADS, etc. Many other Chinese will join in due to the horrible crimes and extreme repression of the CCP regime. It would be the ugliest civil war in history.

The virus also does increased damage to the elderly.

China has a problem with too many old people. “It’s the No. 1 economic problem for China going forward,” says Stuart Leckie, chairman of Stirling Finance Ltd., a Hong Kong–based pension-fund consulting firm that has advised the Chinese government."" By 2050, 330 million Chinese will be over age 65, which is a huge issue because China is entering negative population growth.

https://time.com/5523805/china-aging-population-working-age/

Two birds with one stone. Kill a few million people, but not too many to truly cripple China in the long run. Remember, China killed 45 million people in 4 years, such a scheme is not beyond them.

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html

This virus also gives them cover to purge dissidents. With martial law declared and so many people dying, you could kill a shit ton of people without much notice. Maybe they move into Hong Kong to help manage the sick and enforce quarantine. It gives you a good excuse to tighten the grip on your country.

**Millions of people around the world** got a very small taste of what can happen when technology fails on Monday when most of the Google network went down, and people could not access their Gmail email accounts, YouTube videos, and many other Google services.

For those who rely upon Google for home devices, it was a sobering wake-up call.  


These inconveniences suffered this week with Google going down are NOTHING compared to what is probably coming down the road, and which could be imminent.

Imagine what life will be like with no Internet at all for an extended period of time, and where electrical service could become very unstable and also be down for an extended period of time.

For those who have been paying attention, the Globalists have actually been warning us that this is coming for sometime now.

Earlier this year *Health Impact News* reported about Event 201 which was hosted by the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and was a simulation of a worldwide pandemic and the response to that pandemic in October of 2019, just weeks before the now infamous COVID19 virus was identified in Wuhan, China.

Almost everything predicted during that simulation has now actually happened, except for one thing: an Internet blackout.

Will There be an Internet Blackout to Control Information? 

Earlier this year around the time the U.S. Presidential debates started, the media started using the term ""Dark Winter.""  


Derrick Broze of  [***The Conscious Resistance***](https://healthimpactnews.com/2020/did-bill-gates-world-economic-forum-predict-coronavirus-outbreak-will-there-be-an-internet-blackout-to-control-information/) created a 12-minute documentary covering the historical meaning of ""Dark Winter"" and how it has been used in the past for simulations, much like Event 201.

*Dark Winter* exercise took place in June 2001, only months before the 9/11 attacks. This exercise took place at Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs, Maryland, and involved several Congressmen, a former CIA director, a former FBI director, government insiders and privileged members of the press. **The exercise simulated the use of smallpox as a biological weapon against the American public.**

During the *Dark Winter* exercise authorities attempt to stop the spread of ""dangerous misinformation"" and ""unverified"" cures, just like with the Event 201 simulation. Dark Winter further discusses the suppression and removal of civil liberties, such as the possibility of the President to invoke ""The Insurrection Act"", which would allow the military to act as law enforcement upon request by a State governor, as well as the possibility of ""martial rule.""

The script says martial rule may ""include, but are not limited to, prohibition of free assembly, national travel ban, quarantine of certain areas, suspension of the writ of habeas corpus \[i.e. arrest without due process\], and/or military trials in the event that the court system becomes dysfunctional.""

What is important to know is *Dark Winter* was largely written and designed by Tara O'Toole and Thomas Inglesby of the Johns Hopkins Center along with Randy Larsen and Mark DeMier of the Analytic Services (ANSER) Institute for Homeland Security. 

O'Toole, Inglesby, and Larsen were directly involved in the response to the alleged anthrax attacks which took place in the days after September 11, 2001. These individuals personally briefed Vice President Cheney on *Dark Winter.*

Coincidentally, Event 201 was co-hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which is currently led by Dark Winter co-author Thomas Inglesby. Tara O'Toole was also a key player in the Clade X simulation.  


**'DIGITAL PANDEMIC'**

Why is the Corporate Media Predicting a ""Dark Winter""? On July 8, 2020, the World Economic Forum met and discussed a ""Digital Pandemic"" which they claimed would be far more disastrous than the COVID pandemic.

Jeremy Jurgens, the World Economic Forum Managing Director, stated:

""I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we've seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.""

Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, stated:

""We all know, but still pay insufficient attention, to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack."" ...

Most reports are now saying that if he does not get the Supreme Court to over-turn the election results, that he will invoke the ""Insurrection Act"" and deploy the military domestically to allegedly start arresting people for ""treason.""

War, particularly cyber war, seems to have already been started, and everyone should absolutely prepare for the chaos that seems to be on our very doorstep, with the predictions of the World Economic Forum very likely coming true, since almost everything they originally predicted and planned for regarding COVID has come true.",conspiracy,Wuhan

People will never admit that they fell for a staged propaganda campaign drummed up by the CCP. The virus was real and did pose a threat but it wasn't anything like the fear propaganda that was intentionally leaked.

When this whole issue happened China had their 50 cent party cyber army in lockstep all harvesting the fear of people on the Internet. If you were paying attention there were a few key weeks where reddit became filled with these CCP members and social media everywhere was in chaos over the Virus. They assumed total authoritative power over the now most popular sub about the subject and I witnessed it first hand. 

They took hold of that fear campaign and never let go of it.

The reason for the recent ""pool party"" wasn't because they beat the virus it's because the virus was never that big of a threat to begin with. The threat is in everyone's head.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-the-worst-of-the-pandemic-is-yet-to-come-and-freedom-played-a-part-in-the-disappointing-us-response-2020-08-20](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-the-worst-of-the-pandemic-is-yet-to-come-and-freedom-played-a-part-in-the-disappointing-us-response-2020-08-20)

That hospital they built had NO drainage or water connections coming from it. It was literally a carcass set on top of a pad... It was another staged and orchestrated attempt to inflict the ""seriousness of the situation"" in order to promote the fear of the virus. They spent a couple months orchestrating a highly sophisticated propaganda network to make sure the fear bait was front and center in the feeds of Americans.

They then used giant aerosol disinfectant cannons and recorded massive parades of them and even drones spraying disinfectants.  Welding people in their apartments was another phase....

Here's a recap of the fear mongering campaign to give people a brief understanding of why they decided lock downs were the only way .... 

# COVID19 Wuhan Flu Cinematic Version

But we're fighting back, recently a popular video game developer allowed their game trailer to feature bits of truth and I believe it's a warning to our youth.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7s-n0TbR6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7s-n0TbR6M)

The trailer features a segment with Tienanmen Square and later reversed to appease China.....

Right now the western world is under attack by communists and they're being played like a fiddle using all the latest technocratic tools...

Reportedly Chinese consulate members left in Houston because they were caught orchestrating BLM/Antifa insurrectionist movement and training them on how to go about it.

# [Chinese Consulate in Houston Intervened in US Political Movement](http://chinascope.org/archives/24225)

"" The purpose was to “weaponize” big data technology. It delivered relevant materials precisely to those people who were most likely to participate in the protests, while other people could not even find those videos.

*RFA* did not spell out the company names. A Twitter account said the technicians were from Huawei and the video platform they used to identify candidates and push videos to was TikTok.""

**Synopsis:** all these things below are happening and becoming more of a reality each day:

# Fourth-generation warfare

 

* Complex and long term
* [Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism) (tactic)
* A non-national or transnational base – highly decentralized
* A direct attack on the enemy's culture, including genocidal acts against civilians.
* Highly sophisticated [psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare) and [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda), especially through [media manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_manipulation), [internet trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll), [bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent) and [lawfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare)
* All available pressures are used – political, economic, social and military
* Occurs in [low-intensity conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-intensity_conflict), involving actors from all networks
* Non-combatants are tactical dilemmas
* Lack of hierarchy
* Small in size, spread out network of communication and financial support
* Use of insurgency tactics as subversion, terrorism and [guerrilla tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare)
* Decentralised forces

## [Current Communist Goals (1963)](https://governamerica.com/issues/domestic-issues/homeland-security/22033-current-communist-goals-1963)

 1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.  


2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.  


3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament \[by\] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.  


4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.  


5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.  


6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.  


7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.  


8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.  


9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.  


10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.  


11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)  


12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.  


13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.  


14. Continue giving Russia/China access to the U.S. Patent Office.  


15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.  


16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.  


17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.  


18. Gain control of all student newspapers.  


19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.  


20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.  


21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.  


22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to ""eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.""  


23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. ""Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.""  


24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them ""censorship"" and a violation of free speech and free press.  


25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  


26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as ""normal, natural, healthy.""  


27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with ""social"" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a ""religious crutch.""  


28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of ""separation of church and state.""  


29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.  


30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the ""common man.""  


31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the ""big picture."" Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.  


32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.  


33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.  


34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.  


35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.  


36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.  


37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.  


38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand \[or treat\].  


39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.  


40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.  


41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.  


42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use \[""\]united force\[""\] to solve economic, political or social problems.  


43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.  


44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.  


45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction \[over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction\] over nations and individuals alike.

The following is primarily a timeline of information relevant to what is discussed by Klaus Schwab, the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, which describes itself as ""the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation"". This timeline will present information based on the themes of what Shwab calls the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"", as well as potential crises that could allow for the acceleration of its implementation.



**June 22-23, 2001**: ""The [*Dark Winter*](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events-archive/2001_dark-winter/) exercise, held at Andrews AFB, Washington, DC, June 22-23, 2001, portrayed a fictional scenario depicting a covert smallpox attack on US citizens.""

**January 14, 2005**: ""[Atlantic Storm](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020090646/http://www.atlantic-storm.org/about.html) was a ministerial table-top exercise convened on January 14, 2005 by the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the Johns Hopkins University, and the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network. The exercise used a fictitious scenario designed to mimic a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond to a bioterrorist attack.""

""During the six hour meeting, the transatlantic leaders wrestled with the enormity and rapid pace of the emerging epidemics of smallpox, the tension between domestic politics and international relations, the challenge of controlling the movement of people across borders, and an international shortage of critical medical resources such as smallpox vaccine.""

**September 7-8, 2006**: [Black ICE (Bioterrorism International Coordination Exercise)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090314080914/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/79521.pdf)

""In the Black ICE scenario six terrorists from South Asia self-infect with smallpox and, while they are at their most contagious, travel by air to Central Asia. During their travel and upon arrival, the terrorists infect as many people as possible with the disease. National response capabilities are quickly overwhelmed and governments call upon international organizations for assistance in areas such as disease diagnosis and interventions, public health and law enforcement investigations, coordinating transportation policies, and managing displaced populations.""

""The Chinese government’s quick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens, as well as its instant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of lives, stopping the spread of the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter postpandemic recovery."" (Page 18)

""During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified."" (Page 19) 

""In developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: **biometric IDs for all citizens**, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests."" (Page 19)

(Page 33)

""Companies that deal with sensitive and critical information such as **those in financial services should put cyberattacks at the top of their list of risks**. While CEOs and corporate boards are increasingly becoming aware of the threat, not everyone knows how to respond to it effectively. In today’s hyperconnected world, companies need to have dedicated IT teams to constantly monitor technology systems and devise ways to repel cyber attacks. Encryption is another line of defence as is two-factor verification – requiring a username and password; **use of biometric information, such as fingerprints and DNA**, are also useful techniques.""

Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance: ""Daszak reiterated that, until an infectious disease crisis is very real, present, and at an emergency threshold, it is often largely ignored. To sustain the funding base beyond the crisis, he said, we need to increase public understanding of the need for MCMs such as a pan-influenza or **pancoronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics follow the hype.** We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of process, Daszak stated."" (Page 73)

""...the tracking and sharing of information about us is a crucial part of the new connectivity. Debates about fundamental issues such as the impact on our inner lives of the loss of control over our data will only intensify in the years ahead. Similarly, the revolutions occurring in biotechnology and AI, which are redefining what it means to be human by pushing back the current thresholds of life span, health, cognition, and capabilities, will compel us to redefine our moral and ethical boundaries.""

""Governments are increasingly advancing digital identity systems to support multiple goals: efficient public service delivery, sustained rule of law and robust democratic processes.

Going direct, which can be organised in a variety of different ways, works by: 1) bypassing the interest rate channel when this traditional central bank toolkit is exhausted, and; 2) enforcing policy coordination so that the fiscal expansion does not lead to an offsetting increase in interest rates. 

An extreme form of 'going direct' would be an explicit and permanent monetary financing of a fiscal expansion, or so-called helicopter money."" (Page 2)

""...in a downturn the only solution is for a more formal – and historically unusual – coordination of monetary and fiscal policy to provide effective stimulus."" (Page 8)

""Any additional measures to stimulate economic growth will have to go beyond the interest rate channel and 'go direct' – when a central bank crediting private or public sector accounts directly with money. One way or another, this will mean subsidising spending – and such a measure would be fiscal rather than monetary by design. This can be done directly through fiscal policy or by expanding the monetary policy toolkit with an instrument that will be fiscal in nature, such as credit easing by way of buying equities. This implies that an effective stimulus would require coordination between monetary and fiscal policy – be it implicitly or explicitly."" (Page 8)

130,"Wuhan lab leak evidence 'overwhelming', scientists say",448.0,o44s2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/o44s2r/wuhan_lab_leak_evidence_overwhelming_scientists/,71.0,1624192524.0," 

There is now ""overwhelming"" evidence that Covid-19 was created in a Chinese lab, according to two top American scientists, who say the chance that SARS-CoV-2 emerged naturally in animals is ""one in a million"".

Steven Quay and Richard Muller, who this month published an explosive opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal laying out the scientific case for the lab-leak theory, have told an online conference that the world risks a biological world war if so-called ""gain of function"" research is not shut down immediately.

Quay, the chief executive of pharmaceutical company Atossa Therapeutics, told the Washington DC-based Hudson Institute that advances in virus and vaccine research had ""opened the floodgates where you can have a bioweapon in the morning and have a vaccine in the afternoon"", the Australian first reported.

In his presentation, Quay said a key piece of evidence pointing to a lab leak was the fact that when the virus first appeared, it was already extremely contagious, unlike other viruses which can be observed evolving as they spread through a population until the most contagious form dominates.

""Covid-19 wasn't smouldering in the community before the pandemic began, as was observed with previous coronavirus epidemics,"" he said.

Based on comparison with the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS epidemics, Quay said ""the probability that a community-acquired zoonosis"" would produce the results seen in the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 was ""literally one in a million"".

Muller, an astrophysicist from the University of California, Berkeley, said there were concerns scientists would be ""black-listed and labelled an enemy of China"" if they pursued the lab-leak theory.

""That meant that China was exercising control over US freedom of speech,"" he said. ""US scientists didn't even want to discuss the issue for fear of what China would do. That is a very frightening conversation.""

The comments came as a Harvard scientist admitted that she and her colleagues were reluctant to publicly support the lab-leak theory because they didn't want to be associated with former US President Donald Trump.

""At the time, it was scarier to be associated with Trump and to become a tool for racists, so people didn't want to publicly call for an investigation into lab origins,"" Alina Chan, who was one of 18 scientists who published a letter in the journal Science last month calling for more in-depth investigation into the virus' origin, told NBC.

The lab-leak theory, which was espoused by Trump and others in his Administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has gained renewed traction in recent weeks as fresh circumstantial evidence has emerged.

The Wall Street Journal revealed last month that three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill in November 2019, and video evidence obtained by Sky News this week proved live bats were kept in cages at the lab, contradicting World Health Organisation investigator Peter Daszak who had dismissed the claim as a ""conspiracy theory"".

The WHO's investigation into the origins of Covid-19 concluded in February that it was ""extremely unlikely"" the virus came from a lab.

&#x200B;

[The \\""genetic fingerprint\\"" of SARS-CoV-2 indicates it was created in a lab, Dr Steven Quay and Professor Richard Muller say. \(Photo \/ CDC via AP\)](https://preview.redd.it/d98hz5bp0f671.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b65df594c6b514ebc7cc7d6930e28911af5aa4bc)

 

Doubts about the quality of the findings led the US Government to last month instruct its intelligence agencies to conduct a fresh 90-day inquiry, with US President Joe Biden and other world leaders calling for further investigations.

In the US, the death toll from Covid-19 this week passed 600,000. Globally the estimated death toll is around 3.8 million.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal this month, Quay and Muller explained that the ""genetic fingerprint"" of SARS-CoV-2 was the most damning indication it had been created in a lab.

They pointed to a specific amino acid sequence known as CGG-CGG, or double CGG, that is commonly spliced into viruses by researchers in order to increase their lethality.

""In fact, in the entire class of coronaviruses that includes CoV-2, the CGG-CGG combination has never been found naturally,"" they wrote.

""Now the damning fact. It was this exact sequence that appears in CoV-2. Proponents of zoonotic origin must explain why the novel coronavirus, when it mutated or recombined, happened to pick its least favourite combination, the double CGG. Why did it replicate the choice the lab's gain-of-function researchers would have made?""

**Arguments against a lab leak**

But Professor Dominic Dwyer, director of public health pathology in New South Wales, who was part of the 17-strong international team of experts on the WHO team in January, remains sceptical of the lab-leak theory.

""The lab leak sits there, but you need some sort of evidence to take it further,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald this month.

Dwyer said the key flaw in the hypothesis was that there was no evidence the Wuhan Institute of Virology had the SARS-CoV-2 virus before the pandemic – and that it was unlikely it would have had the virus and not published a paper about it.

""They are a pretty prominent research institute,"" he said.

""They publish a lot of very good papers and have collaborations with people around the world. If they had it, there was no reason to hide it from a scientific or intellectual point of view.""

Speaking to SBS this week, he again argued animal-to-human transmission was the most likely origin and was a ""tried and true process"".

""Plenty of other viruses have gone down this pathway before, including the original SARS and MERS, which are coronaviruses that have come across into humans,"" he said.

""Nearly all human viruses identified in the last 40 or 50 years have come from animals in one form or another, and bats are a major contributor. So, there's a history there and it's well-documented.""",conspiracy,Wuhan

* [Here's a video of CLO\_Junkie](https://youtu.be/Vd8j8Vr0ZzM) that they [posted to reddit \~19 days ago.](https://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ex7bgp/meta_reddit_as_a_p2p_health_information_exchange/) | [*Archive*](http://archive.is/MCg2P)
* [CLO\_Junkie can be seen on the right](https://i.imgur.com/7tzT5Gl.png) discussing 'Reddit as a p2p health information exchange forum' with another reddit mod.
* CLO\_Junkie would regularly lie to users without any issue. As Relik explains here, [CLO\_Junkie lied about how they ""rarely ban people"" themself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bannedfromcoronavirus/comments/f5hi2u/coronavirus_and_china_flu_mod_logs/fhz3irp/) The truth was that CLO\_Junkie would mass ban users they disagreed with and [then go brag about it on Discord.](https://i.imgur.com/bD0jt8Q.png)
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/KDMMTCd.png)  of the time CLO\_Junkie joked about quarantining fellow mod DeadlyKitt,  who is one of the nicest people I've come accross on reddit.
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DGz10jr.png)  of the time CLO\_Junkie was abusive towards another mod Kimmey12.  CLO\_Junkie would remove mod permissions if anyone they disagreed with  stepped out of line. [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tZ5iYyf.png) of CLO\_Junkie in the senior mod discord saying Kimmey has been a PITA since they joined. Sorry Kimmey.
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/TkbNyCq.png) of CLO\_Junkie describing their hunt for the leaker with -Ph03niX-.
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/d8QH6nF.png)  of CLO\_Junkie being a hypocrite and telling other mods not to post  memes on China\_Flu and then posting a meme themself under their alt  account 'DesertAlt'.
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/I0d7zBJ.png) of CLO\_Junkie talking about using feedback threads as a way to attract dissenters and perma ban them since [""there is no place for them here. Ideally, ban them in both subreddits.""](https://i.imgur.com/vwPKh2n.png)
* [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oQnzHzL.png)  of CLO\_Junkie getting frustrated that they can't double ban users from  both Coronavirus and China\_Flu for a rule violation in one subreddit. [Another one.](https://i.imgur.com/t0wR6Dv.png)

After I [leaked the mod logs a few days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/f5vqqm/coronavirus_and_china_flu_mod_logs/)  CLO\_Junkie spent a large portion of their time hunting down the  possible leaker. Instead of just taking the time to reflect on why the  logs were leaked they simply wanted to silence all opposition on the mod  team the same way they've done on reddit. Even when CLO\_Junkie was  starting to consider the idea of public mod logs they decided to bring  -Ph03niX- on board. Since -Ph03niX- is a terrible person and a power mod  of hundreds of subreddits, including TopMindsOfReddit and  AgainstHateSubreddits, [they persuaded CLO\_Junkie to not release the logs and continue the censorship without user oversight.](https://i.imgur.com/ceoVukQ.png)

Finally  I'll finish by saying I'm not exempt from any blame. I talked badly  about the anti-subreddits and the free speech fanatics. I censored a lot  of posts and comments. I stood by silently as CLO\_Junkie hunted down  and banned innocent mods. Most of these were necessary evils in order to  expose some of the mod abuse occuring behind the scenes.

Here are the automoderator configs for [China\_Flu](https://pastebin.com/GcdsTyJw) and [Coronavirus](https://pastebin.com/NJgEbH06) at the time of my departure if you're curious what words, websites, and subreddits are being filtered.

To all the other mods reading this, speak up next time. Quit the bullshit and make the mod logs public.

*Shout-out  to a few of my favorite members: SecretAgentIceBat, DNAhelicase,  kimmey12, barber5, pat000pat, BurrShotFirst1804, FlyingDutchman1337,  DeadlyKitt4, and Shrine.*

*Appologies  to justcool393, king\_of\_the\_ayleids, Meepo69, and any other mods that  were hunted by CLO\_Junkie because of their tech experience and previous  posting history.*

*Scientists wrote to the US officials postulating those deaths were likely due to coronavirus. Their warnings were ignored.*

*Prior to that, the US Military’s main biolab at Fort Detrick, Maryland was completely shut down by CDC with a “cease and desist” order to the military due to absence of safeguard measure against pathogen leakage. The ‘e-cigarette’ epidemic arose immediately after this event.*

An article presented further details. It stated in part that five “foreign” athletes or other personnel visiting Wuhan for the **World Military Games** (October 18-27, 2019) were **hospitalized in Wuhan for an undetermined infection**.

*Another interesting fact was the American participants* ***never win any gold medal****\*, not even one single gold medal at the World Military Games. The give rise to the question are the so called ""athletes"" even real, or are they actually experts tasked with the mission to ""spread coronavirus""?*

\*Original Post\*

I work as an anaesthetist and intensivist and sometimes / rarely the patients who are admitted to intensive care and their families are very upset and would shout at my colleagues, even calling them murderers, because the ""virus doesn't exist"". Of course my colleagues think they are derranged and privately laugh at these people, but actually there is a reason why, the statement, 'covid-19 is not caused by a virus,' is true. I will explain this now, but it's complex so this post is going to be lengthy, but hopefully easy to read.

First off, having a disease, even a ""viral disease"", doesn't mean it is caused by what we call a virus. Even though there is a decades long culture of studying viruses, with nobel prize winning scientists, and a whole field of virology and microbiologists who subspecialise in virology - it's possible that they are all wrong. So, put yourself in the mindset that a huge mistake has been made in the understanding of a virus, that all these people are wrong and now I will explain how, and what a virus actually is.

Scurvy used to spread through ships and people must have thought there is some contagion, if we had no knowledge of vit C deficiency, then these days we might have assumed it's a virus. Actually, we probably could relate scurvy to a virus because, what we call a virus should appear in people who have the disease of scurvy... and indeed on land we call this disease, Ebola.

Viruses are part of the communication mechanisms between cells, they contain genetic material in a protein capsule and they have receptors on top that bind to cells. Cells produce it, especially dying cells, to alarm other cells that there is high toxicity in the environment so that they all enter a state of conservation of life, therefore a person in that state will enter that mode and that removes all the energy from the body creating discomfort. So a cell that receives a toxic signal for whatever reason triggers the alarm by excreting what science calls a ""virus."" To alert others.

If the toxicity is greater than a certain range, then many cells will secrete what is called a virus, which is also a cellular mechanism for excreting or getting rid of internal toxicity. So a person with, let's say, flu, gets like this because of an energy collapse caused mostly by prolonged stress, so their body goes into shock, and other opportunistic organisms take advantage of a weak immune system, I mean bacteria, staph, candid, and so on, which were previously in a state of balance with the body. This extra toxicity causes the excretion of this cellular exosubstance that we call ""viruses"".

It has two main functions. A.- Give the alarm to other cells, by passing genetic information on, coding the nature of the alarm. (a good example of this, is blood oranges, which start out as normal oranges but when the environment becomes cold this triggers the release of a virus to warn the cells in the orange that it is a certain amount of cold, which triggers the transformation into what we call a blood orange, see: [https://youtu.be/Tryg5UCp6fI?t=2942](https://youtu.be/Tryg5UCp6fI?t=2942)) B.- Excrete the accumulated toxicity inside (when relevant) to try to survive.

So if a cell enters a state of toxicity, like a person's throat cell because they have been breathing cold air for a long time in a state of prolonged stress, then the bacteria in the throat are thrown out of balance by the stimulus of cold and the suppressed or weak immune system. And the cells in the throat will start to secrete what humans call the flu virus. It is the effect of a problem, not the cause, we have it backwards.

Now something else happens ... When a person has a lot of flu, all their mucous membranes secrete that toxicity, that's what mucus is for, to get rid of what the body does not need, more than anything else of toxins of all kinds. So those secretions come out with coughs and sneezes and are full of viruses, but which could be more accurately described as exogenous-type cellular secretions, so these secretions, badly called viruses, are in the air and enter the mucous membranes of another person.

Remember these are alarm signals that something is wrong so these exo-genes enter the other person's biology and that other person's cellular receptors interpret it for what it is ... an alarm, and if that person is also under a lot of stress, that will trigger a chain signal making that person sick too.

But if that other person is not under stress and has a healthy immune system, another person's exo-gene signal will come through and perhaps alarm a group of cells but their body will quickly say, in its own way, that nothing is wrong and that person does not get sick. So that is why some people get the flu and others don't.

It is worth mentioning that when a person is under a lot of stress, it is most likely that the person is not alone under that stress but that their companions, the other people in their family or community are also under it. So the weaker person will begin to excrete that toxicity and start a chain reaction with their entire family for the exo-gene warning signs it gives off.

Now, each type of ""virus"", that as I have said is only exo-gene, has precise information and precise receptors that can only be coupled to one class of cells and not to others. In other words, it is specific to a species or even to a specific area or group of cells within a body.

That is, if a bird has a disease that attacks the filaments or roots of the feathers, it will secrete those exo-gene signals and they will be in the air, and perhaps a human being breathes it in... The receptors do not match the ones of human cells, so it does not couple and does not pass its information ... Or in the event that if it does... the receiving human cell will say: wait, I have no feathers, this alarm information is for Goldfinches and Swallows .... and will discard the information. This is why a virus is said to be specific to one species or another.

But species, especially those in the same family in general yes they share cell receptors, it is why cats can ""get sick"" from the flu if a human sneezes. Because even though it is a cat, exo-gene receptors are compatible and if the cat is under stress or favorable conditions, it will also trigger symptoms.

Now if you have a culture of healthy cells in a laboratory culture and you introduce a virus (badly called virus) it will be coupled to the first one it finds and this cell will give off the alarm, secreting more viruses (exo-gene) and it will start a chain reaction which virologists misinterpret as ""a viral infection"". And this invasion in a laboratory test tube will be dramatic because those cells are not supported by an immune system because they are outside of a body. Also in the case of viral cultures the cells in the medium are starved of nutrients and primed with poisonous antibiotics - i.e., they are under a lot of stress.

Science is in diapers with all of this. I have found some very basic ground works that say there are cellular secretions that ""look"" like viruses but are not. They do not go beyond that. So, with covid there is no pathogenic virus of any kind. We have it all upside down, mistaking correlation for causation and having little to no knowledge of what ""viruses"" are. This also implies that the virus gain of function angle is irrelevent, although I have no doubt that such research was conducted, it makes little to no difference in the real world.

But there is more!

So these people in Wuhan or wherever they were, were seeing great toxicity in the bodies of the sick from other things like for example 5G type electromagnetic radiation & air pollution, so they did their human studies ... and found what they call ""viruses"". And these are only alarm signals triggered between cells because of high environmental toxicity. And ignorant doctors said that was the reason. A virus! And they raise the alarm.

They develop a very basic test to detect certain proteins, which are those of cellular exo-gene secretion and if someone has more than a certain number of them, then they are said to have covid-19. And of course they raise the alarm, they lock up the population, the Chinese start with their outrages, their population is in survival mode and under much, much stress and ... not surprisingly they secrete more exo-gene, they give them the test and surprise they also have covid-19. Lock them up! Then it passes to more people to everyone and there they have their pandemic. That is why it is in part a pandemic of fear, and the numbers are manipulated using silly rules such as everyone who dies of any cause within 28 days of a positive test died of covid etc... And now, the all cause mortality really is going up because of... vaccines and ongoing fear / stress and rebranding the flu as covenza or whatever they are up to these days...

If you want to understand some work that has been done on this front, then I recommend the booklet called Breaking The Spell by Tom Cowan, which goes into more detail about the viral culture and how the field of virology has failed to do the control experiment. To prove his point, he funded the control experiment i.e., doing the viral culture without the virus specimen and got sars-cov-2 out the other end.",conspiracy,Wuhan

Bill Gates owns the patent for Coronavirus.

Bill Gates has partial ownership of all 4 biolabs in Wuhan, China. (George Soros has a partial stake in 3).

Bill gates funds the Lieber Foundation which is headed by Charles Lieber, arrested on 28 January 2020 for espionage selling Bioweapons to China, to the same Labs Bill Gates partially owns.

Bill Gates is the primary financier of the World Health Organization. Donating more than $2 Billion over the last decade. The W.H.O. that complimented China and discouraged any 'over-reaction'.

Bill Gates held 'Event 201' in October 2019 simulating a Coronavirus Pandemic, seemingly 30 days prior to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Sponsored by John's Hopkins.

Bill Gates real name is William Henry Gates III, and he is a 12th generation Rockefeller; the Rockefellers own the large majority of healthcare infrastructure throughout the united states, including John's Hopkins which is the official score keeper for Coronavirus.

Bill Gates is on the Epstien Flight Logs.

Bill Gates partnered with Maria Abromovic, staring in Microsoft Commercials. Maria Abromovic is known as the most influential Satanist whom appears in Hillary and Podesta's leaked Emails; she is very specifically connected to pedophilia and torcher in cases such as Epstein, Weinstein, and NXVIM; all of which were brought down as a direct result of Clinton's emails. (Laura Silsbey as well, Clinton Foundation).

Bill Gates father chaired the board of Planned Parenthood; during it's infancy when it was no-secret that it was a eugenics program against colored people. 

Bill Gates has been sued and tried criminally in Africa and India (GUILTY) for crimes against humanity by way of forced vaccinations which caused severe side-effects and death.

Bill Gates has publicly stated that he wants to depopulate the planet using vaccines. Now he wants to chip every person on the planet with ID2020, as a digital passport to travel or work.

If you want to know who is behind Coronavirus, it is the same man who's fingerprints are all over it, and who thinks that he is out in front of it. 

If these facts don't paint the picture for you, I can't help you. You are already dead.

Edit in response to $oUrCeS!!!: If you're too lazy to research this yourself and don't know how to tell the difference between 'fact-checkers' and actual facts, there really is nothing I can do. People are quite litteraly brainwashed to be sheep. If I laid out carefully picked links for each and every point, the people asking for sources would just provide a bogus fact checker, deny it, and go about their happy little sheeply lives. People aren't taught, they have to have a desire to learn. I gave more than enough direction to start people researching. They either research, or they would never have accepted any amount of proof to begin with.

Case and point, Wienstien, Epstien, NXVIM, Silsbey are all directly tied to Clinton, yet people will claim Pizzagate is a lie because of factcheckers and MSM, despite the extremely obvious evidence, the criminal convictions, the emails, the guilty pleas. If someone can't come to grips with that and yet asks for sources, that's a person who was never under any circumstances going to accept the truth.",conspiracy,Wuhan

""The letter said that the Department of Education “is aware of information suggesting Harvard University lacks appropriate institutional controls” on donations, and directly referenced Charles M. Lieber and Jeffrey Epstein.

In January, Lieber — the former Harvard Chemistry department chair — was arrested and charged with failing to disclose funding he received from the Chinese government. Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel is undertaking a review of billionaire donor and convicted sex offender Epstein’s donations to the University.""

""The minimal immune response and seamless interface with brain tissue postimplantation achieved by ultraflexible open mesh electronics probes provide substantial advantages and could enable a wide range of opportunities for in vivo chronic recording and modulation of brain activity in the future.""

Yes, injectable mesh nano wire and mesh electronics that ""wrap"" around neurons has been publicly acknowledged for over 6 years. NIH and Darpa funding of Lieber and his tech is public information. Along with Lieber's ties with Jeffrey Epstein. The simple circuits are powered by bio chemical electricity as well as external electromagnetic energy. This isn't conspiracy.

For those interested, deep dive into Lieber's work. The massive influence he has had on bio nano technology and the curious takedown and silencing of him in January of 2020 right at the beginning of the pandemic, not long after his ties with Epstein were revealed.

The current generation of mRNA treatments is just the beginning. We are in the experimental phase. Different batches are being delivered to select groups and 1000s of experiments are being run. All under the guise of a pandemic.

What is the goal? The goal is mass depopulation and to accommodate this MASSIVE effort individuals are being injected with literal mind controlling nano circuits. The technology is crude, in that the ""control"" is about as targeted as a lobotomy. But it serves a very real and essential purpose.

As the first world hospital systems are transformed into death processing centers the need to keep people confused about what they will be seeing with their own eyes will become paramount. The treatments will inspire mass death while cloaking an indisputable link to the vaccines. They also actively disarm one's innate defense against lies, mistrust through crude electromagnetic stimulation of neurons wrapped in nano mesh and nano wire transistors.

During the time of the Mayans the priests used knowledge of celestial events like eclipses to maintain absolute control over the regular people. They would 'predict' observable events but assign different meaning to them. People would be told the gods were angry and were going to black out the sun as a foreboding warning to increase child sacrifice OR ELSE. A single eclipse would guarantee compliance with the most brutal and inhuman dictates. The priests did not believe the God's were blacking out the sun. They used their scientific deception to manipulate and control.

Nothing has changed. We are being told by Gates and Fauci that numbers will increase in the fall, that a 4/5/6th wave is going to result from unvaccinated. When the numbers increase and nth wave hits, death counts start to rise in the vaccinated, the science authorities will be vindicated and further compliance is rendered. Trust the science, don't learn it.

There's lots of ""conspiracy theorists were right"" going around lately. The problem is we are still 10 steps behind. Fauci and gang make predictions (models) for things that have been planned and set into motion many years ago. Whenever anything is exposed they've got actual believable counter arguments published in scientific journals. But they don't tell you about the alternative science representing the actual truth. Majority of mankind has agreed to be killed and to support mass depopulation efforts. Lobotomized.",conspiracy,Wuhan

The substack article we were referencing was written by Walter Chesnut in which he deduced that the lab-made Spike Protein causes Amyloid plaques and a dangerous “tangled” iteration of the protein called Tau.

When Tau tangles, or “tangled Tau” and beta-amyloid plaques accumulate in large enough numbers, these microscopic brain protein fragments impede a person’s ability to think and remember; this condition is diagnosed as AD.

Without getting too technical, I called this potential phenomenon Accelerated AD (AAD), concluding that AAD will impact *all* demographics that subjected themselves to the DEATHVAX™. Yes, even children.

Walter Chesnut made the following point:

>However, it has since been discovered that the PRESENCE of Amyloid greatly ACCELERATES the deposition of Tau. This is most likely why the elderly, and those that have certain Amyloid-expressing conditions, experience more severe disease.

In naturally occurring cases of AD the amount of tangled Tau is around 1%, but with the introduction of the Spike Protein there is an hyper-production of tangled Tau. Tangled Tau is a misfolded or disordered protein, and as such is extraordinarily harmful.

>Therefore, I believe the Spike Protein is inducing ***massive*** amounts of hyperphosphorylated Tau, which is creating the fibrils. This explains the AD, PD and even can explain the sudden cardiac deaths, as Tauopathies effect both the CNS and the peripheral autonomic nervous system.

Basically, the Spike Protein (especially the gene therapy variant which has two lab-made proline modifications, thus making it even more deadly over time) induces the endogenous production of fibriles which kick off a whole range of adverse events over time, and ultimately cause premature death.

All demographics will experience this “geriatric” disease, even children.

All demographics will experience premature death.

Walter Chesnut’s full [article](https://wmcresearch.substack.com/p/understanding-the-cns-and-peripheral?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web).

At the end of our conversation, I asked my associate if the bioweapon perpetrators specifically knew that they were targeting endogenous abnormal Tau production with their Gain of Function (GoF) research. My associate replied that he was 100% certain that they always knew about Tau, prion-based diseases, cardiac damage, etc.

The more toxic Tau buildup, the greater the AAD brain damage. The greater the AAD brain damage, the easier it is to control and depopulate said AAD brain damaged swaths of the population.

And now just a few days later we have incontrovertible proof; to wit:

Let’s start with the obvious: the year of publication was 2014.

Researcher 'Shibo Jiang' from Fudan University, Shanghai and the rest of the team were all CCP assets. They also happened to have ties with Dr. Mengele 2.0 aka Dr. Fauci and his NIH.

We know that COVID-19 had GoF HIV and TB insertions.

We know that the DEATHVAX™ causes VAIDS.

We also know that the Tau protein was [discovered in 1975](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1057175/). By 1985 researchers had already linked Tau to abnormal protein deposits found in the brains of AD patients. Tau was [proven](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3973960/) to be one of the causes of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles.

By 2014 all researchers studying AD and Beta-amyloid fibrils knew about Tau. And researchers studying HIV-1 and virus attachments in relation to AD and Beta-amyloid fibrils all knew about the role Tau plays in neurodegenerative disease.

The CCP and NIH researchers also all knew that “amyloid fibriles play an important role in microbial infection.” Read that last part again.

***Thus, they all knew they were infecting and transfecting people with AAD via their lab-made Spike Protein.***

Enter Walter Chesnut [again](https://wmcresearch.substack.com/p/long-covid-is-a-phenotype-of-the?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web).

The very same CCP and NIH researchers always knew that their lab-modified Spike Protein cytotoxin would be a kind of self-replicating or self-generating Amyloidogenic protein.

The Modified mRNA gene therapy injection swaps out the Uracil component of the four naturally occurring RNA nucleobases for the synthetic Pseudouridine. The former lasts around 2 minutes in the body, while the latter lasts ***indefinitely***.

Ergo, the lab-made Spike Protein of the DEATHVAX™ may be self-replicating ***indefinitely.***

Ergo, tangled Tau production may be endogenously accelerating *indefinitely*.

Ergo, those that subjected themselves to the gene therapy are all experiencing Long COVID, even if they “feel” fine.

Long Covid may be premature AD, or AAD.

Ergo, those that subjected themselves to the gene therapy all have the dangerous tangled Tau endogenously slowly growing inside them as a direct function of the modified Spike Proteins that are perpetually being produced by the Modified mRNA and as such are persistently inducing the cascading neurological damage, even if they “feel” fine.

By the way, most AD sufferers “feel” fine, even while they are anything but.

Therefore, the researchers that created COVID-19 and the slow kill bioweapon injectables *always* knew exactly what they were devising.

They knew that this entire PSYOP-19 program would slowly but surely wipe out the planet, and what easier members of society to cull than those suffering from AAD?

The doubly infantilized — on the cultural (Death Cultist) and neurological (DEATHVAX™) levels — owning nothing in their frozen catatonic grins will all be happily depopulated off of the planet by the One World Government technocrats ushering in their 4th Industrial Revolution.

They always knew!

We believe it came from bat soup and all social media or articles must be removed for misinformation.

Trumps vaccine are going to kill us all. Oh wait, my boy Joe is in the house jk they’re safe and effective. Remember to keep saying this.

We need two weeks to flatten the curve. Wait,  just two more weeks to slow the spread.

Ok wait, nvm we need to lockdown immediately. All mom and pop small businesses MUST close, you will now refer to Walmart and Amazon for your needs. Covid avoids them during operational hours.

Nobody is forcing you to do anything we just care about your safety, like we always have, signed yours truly, Uncle Sam. 

Anyways, there are no known treatments to help stop Covid, even though it’s a coronavirus with very similar traits to other coronavirus we deal with yearly. You must stay home sick until your about to die. DO IT. When you are finally near death, come to the hospital where we’ll place you on a ventilator to finish the job to receive our government $ kickback.

Wait what? You CANNOT prescribe Ivermectin, we simply cannot risk it, not enough data and testing. Ok whew, now that that’s out of the way, we can finally seek EUA to give out our mRNA vaccines! 

Everyone the day is saved. Get vaccinated. They’re available now. You can’t catch it, spread it, or die from it. 


It’s 95% effective, but wait, just to be sure, you need a second one. Just not with J&J or AstraZeneca, we rolled those out premature and lots of people died haha our bad. 

We need herd immunity. At least 70%. Wait no. 80%. Alright here’s the plan, you need to take TWO shots to be fully vaccinated and then you’re done. 

Maybe we need a Covid pass. Yeah a passport. You’re gonna need it for restaurants, movies, concerts, basic travel, ball parks. 

Oh btw, you still need to wear your mask and quarantine yourself in case you get a break through case. It’s rare. Hardly happens. They are SAFE and EFFECTIVE. Get it. 

Upon further thought, this vaccine isn’t to protect yourself. It’s to protect your loved ones. You can never be too safe. You have to take it. We need to mandate it. For everyone. Hospitals and military, you’re up first!

This pandemic is getting out of hand, we need to flatten the curve more to not overwhelm hospitals! And umm, yeah, we uh, we gotta fire everyone that worked the past 24 months if they won’t get it. 

SAFE and EFFECTIVE god damnit. Hell, mix and match if you want. Start off with Pfizer. Follow up with Moderna. You’re basically bulletproof now.

Look we have lots of studies confirming robust long lasting, durable natural immunity. But do not mention that at all costs. Do not say those words Live on Air. Don’t even hint at it. Shots are the only way.

Wow, year over year a 300% increase in case loads with our vaccinations. Don’t panic you normie, THAT MEANS ITS WORKING.

VAERS is unreliable anyway. Plus, even if 20,000 people are reported dead on there and a Harvard study concludes less than 10% all of known reactions even get sent to VAERS, you can’t trust it. They’re probably alive and we’ll just like Tiffany Dover. She just doesn’t use social media anymore.

Wow cases are rocketing, safe and effective. That means it’s working. It’s working so well we want to give you a booster, it’s the exact same. Well not the kids one, we added an anti heart attack medicine to the concoction so now it’s really just fucking great. 

One of the heads of the FDA stepped down? Ok concerning maybe, but not necessarily remarkable. Wait, the CDC director overrides their own panel in favor of more shots? Well, don’t worry about it. Get your damn shots. And quit asking so many questions.

Social media you are slacking, up your game. Stop this nonsense about natural immunity. Great job Instagram for banning that term. Twitter, you need to censor this harmful disinformation. 

Over 140 million people here have had Covid and recovered? You know, that herd immunity thing we were talking about? Scrap it. Since this virus is less harmful to children than the flu, we recommend all school age children get it. They still have to wear masks too. 

Look, it’s FDA approved baby!! Well ok, none of the others are. Just Pfizer. YES, I realize the technical wording actually says Comirnaty is approved in the future, not what they’re giving out now. Doesn’t matter. SAFE and E-FUCKING-fECTIVE baby!! 

This thing is so good, that we have big exciting news for everyone. Everyone double vaccinated will soon be considered non-vaccinated until you get a booster!! How awesome is that. 3 shots in 9 months you are like The Terminator. But still wear your mask.

Seriously why won’t you get it? DO IT, NOW. It’s the only way out of this. Not zinc, exercise, sunlight, monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, you can’t do that. Vaccines. Only vaccines can beat it. 

We simply don’t have enough information on Ivermectin, but good news, after no long term studies we have officially concluded pregnant women are safe to get them. Also if you’re a pregnant nurse who worked the last 24 months saving lives and don’t want it, you’re fired. We need everyone we can get. This is a SERIOUS pandemic. I’m serious guys.

Look, if you get it, you can be part of a special vaccinated lottery. You can get free beer and donuts, because again, this is for your health. 

We don’t care that Delta and O variant are less deadly than Alpha, it’s contagious. Remember like every other vaccine in history, getting vaccinated was never about protecting yourself, it’s about others. If you don’t double jab, get your booster, mask up, and stay 6ft away from everyone you’re literally a killer. You psychopath. 

Alright, there’s a lot of shady articles about natural immunity, blood clots, strokes, aneurisms, heart attacks, and record high deaths for these and the flu has basically been eradicated, there’s VAERS, there’s cardiologists and epidemiologists who are gravely worried but, the important thing to focus on here, is getting rid of YouTube dislikes and Twitter not be able to report things we don’t like. We need to control the narrative it’s for your own good.

Anyways, I know we’re almost 2 years deep with this, but clearly, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. They’re killing us all. Yes, I got my vaccine, but because my neighbor did not I am at risk. But don’t get it twisted. These are still SAFE and EFFECTIVE. 

Quit worrying about Canada, Austria, Australia, Europe, and all their protests. Quit fucking saying Let’s Go Brandon you god damned fascists, now comply for your 4th shot or you ain’t going anywhere. 

THIS. IS. FOR. YOUR. HEALTH.  You crazy conspiracy nut jobs. This is a naturally occurring virus and didn’t come from the lab. Leave Fauci out of it. He’s basically America’s grandpa and he wouldn’t fucking lie. This is NOTHING like the beginning of Nazi Germany or putting Japanese people into concentration camps. It’s a different kind of camp. And it’s for your own good. 

And one last thing, respect your elders. Bill Gates is smarter than you and it doesn’t matter if they’ve been outspoken in the past about population control. He’s a good guy and is only doing this for his love of humanity. It’s safe and effective.

So please, enough with the Israeli and European data on the clot shots. Stop with your natural immunity hoax stuff. Quit worrying about your right to medical autonomy. Quit bringing up the Nuremberg Code. Stop citing peer reviewed academic journals that doesn’t agree with the *science* . Quit asking god damn questions and listen to me. It’s going to be a dark winter. Get your vaccine, your double vaccine, your booster, and get ready for your 4th in February. It’s fucking safe and effective. Everything is normal.

I dont have but only 1 friend. 

And I have to listen to my parents ridicule me every day, calling me crazy, a loser, a conspiracy theorist, and so forth.

The most frustrating part is the gaslighting:

QR Codes are coming = Crazy
Vaccines wane in efficacy = crazy
Wuhan Lab leak theory = crazy
Ivermectin = crazy
Mandates = crazy
Can't work without vac = crazy
Need a booster cause shots don't work = crazy

I've been called crazy for months before all this happened. Then once one of the above happens, my parents say ""well [son] we all knew this would happen"".

I'm fucking sick of the gas lighting. I'm sick of being called crazy for months, then what I'm being called crazy for happens, and you think I wouldn't be called crazy, but no, they act like they were aware of it the whole time, and then call me emotional. 

It's like....they fucking insult me on a daily basis, then provide proof why I'm not crazy, and then they deny me ever making my claims and call me emotional and laugh at me as I get frustrated by them gaslighting me. 

My parents have always been textbook narcissists. It's so annoying being surrounded by people who think you're wrong, meanwhile you've been right the whole time.

Not to mention I have my degree in Sociology. It may not have provided a job after university,  but it's by far the best field to analyze covid with. I studied society, and what's happening with covid is nothing short of approaching genocide.

I’m from Australia and cases here are quite low maybe 150+ as of today? 150 cases but we have a ridiculous amount of people arriving from Asia and Europe but the virus seems to not be spreading here as much as other countries like Iran?? And Italy??
Oh but somehow Tom Hanks has caught the virus while in Australia. Our government have announced an economic stimulus package giving those on government benefits a one off payment of $750 due 31st March to stimulate the economy but we only have 150 cases and everything seems pretty normal here in Sydney although all non perishable items like toilet paper and rice have been sold out for days?
(I think they started this panic but themselves by limiting stock early on and getting media coverage of it causing people to panic buy). Just now our prime minister has announced he suggest people not to go to “non essential” large gatherings of 500 people or more starting Monday, keeping schools uni and public transport all open??

Enough about Australia, it’s a mess

We are told not to wear face masks as they don’t do anything to help with contracting the virus, so don’t buy the masks cos we have a large shortage of the masks and the doctors and nurses who are treating the people with COVID 19 need them so they don’t get the virus although it can be spread though bodily liquid even your eyes.

All large sporting events have been cancelled because they don’t want people to gather in large crowds but not all sporting events just some, just the big ones, oh but some big ones can play for another week or so?

We are told the virus started in Wuhan and was potentially passed on from a bat? Oh but the virus can’t be spread through human to animal contact oh but there was a dog who had a case of coronavirus?
Oh yeah ignore China’s only level 4 virology man located under 25km from where the first case was found where they store other deadly viruses. A doctor from Wuhan treating the first patients was the whistle blower for this disease and tried to warn the Chinese government about how bad it was but was ignored. Oh but then they realised themselves it was something very bad and began action. It seemed to only effect the elderly patients with pre existing illnesses oh but the doctor who was the whistle blower was in his 40s and died from the virus?

We are told the virus is very hard to track because it can be spread before symptoms show. But Dcotors are only testing people who have arrived from overseas or are showing the exact symptoms and turning away anyone with just cold like symptoms.

I personally have not met one person who has told me they know someone or know of someone who is in quarantine or has the virus. I have seen no TikTok videos YouTube videos or Facebook Instagram stories of people with coronavirus or expressing their sadness over the death of a loved one from this or a loved one contracting this virus.

The scariest part for me is how much of an impact it is having to the world economy, anyone can look right now at the stocks not knowing anything about them and see the red lines heading south in every stock. This makes me think this entire thing is a deliberate depression, the question is for what?

>**“Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876 with the inauguration of our first president, Daniel Coit Gilman.** He guided the opening of the university and other institutions, including the university press, the hospital, and the schools of nursing and medicine.“ ^2

*Antony Sutton writes:*

>##A Revolutionary Yale Trio

>”In the 1850s, **three members of The Order** left Yale and working together, at times with other members along the way, **made a revolution that changed the face, direction and purpose of American education.** It was a rapid, quiet revolution, and eminently successful.“ ^1

>”The revolutionary trio were:

>• **Timothy Dwight** ('49) Professor in the Yale Divinity School and then 12th President of Yale University.

>• **Daniel Coit Gilman** ('52), first President of the University of California, first President of the Johns Hopkins University and first President of the Carnegie Institution.

>• **Andrew Dickson White** ('53), first President of Cornell University and first President of the American Historical Association.”

>##The Order Is The Original Impulse

>”One observation is that **The Order** gets the ball rolling in new organizations, i.e., **puts in the FIRST President or Chairman and the ideas** and then, when operations are rolling along, often just fades out of the picture.” ^1

>”Among academic associations the American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the American Psychological Association were **all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order.** These are key associations for the **conditioning of society.”**

>##The Order Controls Education

>“...[Daniel Coit Gilman,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman) President of Johns Hopkins University, **imported** [Wundt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt) **psychological methods from Germany,** then welded education and psychology in the U.S., established laboratories, brought these educational laboratories into major Universities and **generated 100s of PhDs to teach the new educational conditioning system.** One of the first of these Johns Hopkins doctorates was [John Dewey.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey). The result we well know. The educational morass of the '80s where most kids -- not all -- can't spell, read or write, yet **can be programmed** into mass behaviour channels.” ^1

>**American Medical Association**

>”Your doctor knows nothing about nutrition? Ask him confidentially and he'll probably confess he had only one course in nutrition. And there's a reason. ^1

>Back in the late 19th century American medicine was in a deplorable state. To the credit of the **Rockefeller General Education Board and the Institute for Medical Research,** funds were made available to staff teaching hospitals and to eradicate some pretty horrible diseases. 

>On the other hand, **a chemical-based medicine was introduced** and the medical profession cut its ties with naturopathy. **Cancer statistics tell you the rest.**

>For the moment we want only to note that the impetus for reorganizing medical education in the United States came from John D. Rockefeller, but **the funds were channeled through a single member of The Order.**

>Briefly, the story is this. One day in 1912 [Frederick T. Gates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Taylor_Gates) of Rockefeller Foundation had lunch with [Abraham Flexner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner) of Carnegie Institution. Said Gates to Flexner:

>**”What would you do if you had one million dollars with which to make a start in reorganizing medical education in the United States?""**

>As reported by [Fosdick,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_B._Fosdick) this is what happened:

>”...**Flexner's reply**, however, to the effect that any funds -- **a million dollars** or otherwise -- **could most profitably be spent in** [developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School,](https://rockfound.rockarch.org/public-health-at-johns-hopkins) struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of **Dr. William H. Welch**, the dean of the institution.""

>Welch was President of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1901, and a Trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1906.”
    
>[William H. Welch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch) **was also a member of the Order** and had been brought to Johns Hopkins University by [Daniel Coit Gilman.”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman)

*Eustace Mullins writes:*

>”The **Flexner Report** was completed in 1910, after many months of travel and study. It was heavily influenced by the **German-trained allopathic representation in the American medical profession.** It was later revealed that the primary influence on Flexner had been his trip to Baltimore. He had been a graduate of Johns Hopkins University. This school had been established by Daniel Coit Gilman (1831- 1908). **Gilman had been one of the three original incorporators of the Russell Trust at Yale University (now known as the Brotherhood of Death).** Its Yale headquarters had a letter in German **authorizing Gilman to set up this branch of the Illuminati in the United States.** ^3

>Gilman incorporated the Peabody Fund and the John Slater Fund, which **later became the Rockefeller Foundation.** Gilman also became an original incorporator of Rockefeller's General Education Board, which was to take over the United States system of medical education; the Carnegie Foundation and the Russell Sage Foundation.  At Johns Hopkins University, Gilman also taught Richard Ely, who became the evil genius of Woodrow Wilson's education.” ^3

##German Connection to Covid?

Klaus Schwab (WEF) and his mentor, Rockefeller henchman and eugenics enthusiast, **Henry Kissinger**, are both German and craving a [“Great Reset”](http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2021/january/04/the-great-reset-is-about-expanding-government-power-and-suppressing-liberty/) aka New World Order, aka Fourth Reich err... um... a “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”

**97 year old Kissinger wrote this article in April 2020:**

[“The Coronavirus Pandemic Will Forever Alter the World Order”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-forever-alter-the-world-order-11585953005?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2)

Another German connection to Covid is **Christian Drosten** and his **bogus** case-demic producing [PCR test.](https://uncoverdc.com/2020/12/03/ten-fatal-errors-scientists-attack-paper-that-established-global-pcr-driven-lockdown)

Drosten attended college at [Goethe University Frankfurt.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe_University_Frankfurt)
Some claim the school has a reputation as “Marxist” or “leftist.” 

The school was named after a famous member of Weishaupt’s **Illuminati.**

*Antony Sutton writes of Hegel and Goethe:*

>”So who or what is the State? Obviously it's a self-appointed elite. It is interesting that [Fichte,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte) who developed these ideas before [Hegel,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) was a **freemason,** almost certainly **Illuminati,** and certainly was promoted by the Illuminati. **For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe (Abaris in the Illuminati code)** pushed Fichte for an appointment at Jena University. ^1

>Furthermore, **the Illuminati principle that the end justifies the means,** a principle that Quigley scores as immoral and used by both [The Group](https://archive.org/details/carrollquigley_angloamericanestablishment/mode/2up) and **The Order, is rooted in Hegel.”**

>##Is The Order of the Skull & Bones part of the Illuminati?

>”When a person is initiated into Skull & Bones, they are given a new name, similar to the practice of the Illuminati.  **Many recorded Illuminati members can be shown to have contact and/or strong influences with many of the professors that taught ""Bonesmen"" in Berlin.** ^4

>When a secret society conspires against the sovereignly of a king, they need to organize, raise funds, make their plans operational, and hopefully bring them to fruition.

>Could we have in the United States a secret society that has used the ""National Security State"" as a cover for their nefarious plans?”

>”Skull and Bones — **the Russell Trust Association** — was first established among the class graduating from Yale in 1833. Its founder was [William Huntington Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Huntington_Russell) of Middletown, Connecticut. The Russell family was the master of incalculable wealth derived from **the largest U.S. criminal organization of the nineteenth century: Russell and Company, the great opium syndicate.”** ^6

>”Not only did Skull and Bones become a **major force in drug smuggling (the Bush and Prescott families in the 1860s), but in true Hegelian fashion, generated the antithesis, the so-called ""war on drugs.""** This hypocritical policy maintains the price of drugs, controls supply, and puts millions in jail while the gainers, in great part, are none other than the same ""Bonesmen"" who pass the laws to prohibit (Bonesman Taft, 1904).” ^1

*Charlotte Iserbyt writes:*

>”The **Hegelian Dialectic** is a process formulated by the German philosopher **Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)** and used by Karl Marx in codifying revolutionary Communism as dialectical materialism. This process can be illustrated as:

>The “Thesis” represents either an established practice or point of view which is pitted against the “Antithesis”—usually a crisis of opposition fabricated or created by change agents—causing the “Thesis” to compromise itself, incorporating some part of the “Antithesis” to produce the “Synthesis”—sometimes called consensus. This is the primary tool in the bag of tricks used by change agents who are trained to direct this process all over the country; much like the in-service training I received. A good example of this concept was voiced by **T.H. Bell** when he was U.S. Secretary of Education: **“[We] need to create a crisis to get consensus in order to bring about change.”** ^5

>”Finally, in conclusion, **we can trace the foundation of three secret societies, in fact the most influential three secret societies that we know about, to Universities.** The Illuminati was founded at University of Ingolstadt. The Group was founded at All Souls College, Oxford University in England, and The Order was founded at Yale University in the United States.
**The paradox is that institutions supposedly devoted to the search for truth and freedom have given birth to institutions devoted to world enslavement.”** ^1

If this account is true this is a truly terrifying situation. World leaders should not be putting their faith in the Chinese government to properly reveal the extent to which the virus has spread, as the CCP clearly has a motive to suppress that information (even if it means killings their own citizens along with citizens in other countries).",conspiracy,Wuhan
192,"Can you prove me wrong or right about Coronavirus? Apparently, this is the only sub left you can discuss it without triggering the normies. I posit the following:",310.0,nfjugj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nfjugj/can_you_prove_me_wrong_or_right_about_coronavirus/,136.0,1621366247.0,"There is one reference genome. One. Provided by Wuhan. No one else has been able to sequence a SARS COV 2 genome. Why? Because they digitally mocked up a chimera in order to trigger as many false positives as possible.

WTF do I mean?

When you need to sequence a genome, you have to blow apart many cells many times and reverse engineer the correct order. The way to do this is to line up the first 4 or 5 nucleotides. So, say you have a 24 nucleotide sequence; they are only looking at the first and last 5 nucleotides to make a match.

Let's say you get some of your thousands and thousands of pieces isolated. They will look like this...

1.   **CAGU**AGCUAGAUACGAUAGCAUUAGC

2.  **ACGU**ACGUACGUACGUACGUGAUC

3.  AGCUGAUCGAUCGAUCGAUC**ACGU**

4.    GAUCGAUCGAUCGAUCGAUC**CAGU**

Your reference genome is going to be thousands of characters. I won't bother demonstrating.

You can see how 1 and 4 have ends that overlap and, with enough data, enough cells and cell fragments, we can reliably figure out the right order. With too little data, we can say anything we want.

But imagine if someone digitally mocked up a genome made up of as many pairings as possible to allow for the highest statistical probability of showing positive.

The genome sequencing, if you were to ask for it, would result in them exploding a sample of your infected cells, then subtract out everything they don't want to see... influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus... whatever. So, even if you have these things, they are eliminated because the sequencer is using the reference genome provided by Wuhan and subtracting all potentially irrelevant data.

The sequencing only looks for segments that match the reference genome.

The BLAST database houses all this data. You can go check for yourself.

While the CDC touts 280k samples have been sequenced, the longest chain I found (after looking through them one by one for a couple of hours) was a 14 nucleotide chain. Most of the submissions were from 30 to 40 random segments of merely small pairs.

This data seems so fake.

You can purportedly order SARS COV 2 for laboratory testing. I have yet to see anyone sequence a full genome beyond what Wuhan provided, but they are clinging to this shit like saran wrap.

Further proof exists in the BS testing. Antigen, antibody and PCR (PCR tests indicate contraindications with other coroanvirus strains on the package) tests all show as positive for every coronavirus strain. Surprise... all human affecting coronaviruses have the S spike protein and the body responds to its presence by adding a CR3022 protein into the polyprotein chain that makes up white blood cells.

CR3022 blocks S spike protein from attaching to your cells. Why make an RNA vaccine when inactive S spikes (like every other previous vaccine and like the vaccines China made for their people) will cause the body to make CR3022?

Think about that. We can make a vaccine that is simple, old fashioned and causes the same result. Why in the F do we need to inject RNA when the Chinese already had a vaccine ready without it, when everyone already knew about S spike proteins and CR3022?

How is it that two totally different types of vaccines were ready to go? How is it that, all over the world, Russia, America, China and many others miraculously found the cure immediately and at almost exactly the same time?

And what happens when you use S spike proteins to block ACE2 receptors in your ovaries and testes? Beyond the metabolic manipulation that can make you slower and more lethargic, oocyte meiosis can be stalled as well as spermatogenesis.

But don't take my word for it...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821659/

>alterations in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-1, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-3 might be one of the most important mechanisms underlying both female and male infertility.

The study plainly states that there are ACE2 receptors in the ovaries and testes and that blocking these receptors will possibly suspend oocyte meiosis and spermatogenesis.

>there is no doubt that ACE1 and ACE2 have gained recognition as significant regulators of the physiology and pathology of the reproductive system. 

Of course, all the relevant data is proprietary. You're not allowed to know what's in the vax beyond a few basic ingredients.

Combine this with the bunk face mask science, where you're just wearing a petri dish of fungus and bacteria on your faces... maybe the occasional amoeba, if you're lucky, and no one you voted for has proven trustworthy. They were either dishonest or too stupid to be in charge but they told morons what to do and morons obeyed without any critical thought. Any.

If that isn't enough, in 2015, the World Bank planned for a coronavirus pandemic with their Pandemic Bonds set to expire March 2020.

If that isn't enough, 9chan accessed the Wuhan Institute of Virology and WHO to prove it was a scam... maybe someone can find screenshots, mine are missing.

The COVID scam is unconventional warfare whereby words and huge astroturfing campaigns were brought to bear to shut down the entire US Military and send them home for a year. They took out a carrier because the Chinese loyalist captain was in on it. 

Your economy was crashed and everyone you allow to be in charge of you was in on it, profiting from it, politicians invested and skilled and locked you in your homes because they are seditious. They hate you and you worship these paid shills. Athletes, politicians, actors, actresses... stop worshipping these fools. They helped this whole thing along.

In fact, 1 Billion in astroturfing was paid for by the US government at the behest of vaccine companies to astroturf in favor of the vaccine.

A billion dollars.

All information is curated and anyone who demonstrates the science to be wrong is deplatformed.

And you all do nothing, as far as I can tell. Happy to watch a stolen election go by. Happy to watch Joe Biden on video, in October 2019, talking about the pandemic that will unseat Trump. 

The whole thing was planned for years.

Astroturfers/shills are actual seditious conspirators against the country and against you and deserve the traitors due.

Meanwhile, hospital data all over the world is being deleted via ransomware.  California, Ireland, New Zealand... and many more. Schools. City governments.

The ransomware isn't just seizing the computers, it has also been leaking all the data to conti news. If the victims do not pay, their data gets leaked and thousands of targets file trees are already floating around online. But what this also means is that we can start verifying the scams these hospitals were running because it isn't looking good.

We are under full blown attack and supply lines are under full blown attack. Your currency is under attack. Shills will claim we are not under attack because they are in on it. Shills will insult and deny, but they cannot address the evidence because they are literally too stupid to understand it and are paid what to think and say... zombies.

My point is, the lies are easily proven and everyone is sitting on their hands and the truth is the leaders of these seditious and foreign conspirators need to be tried and executed because that is literally the only thing that will stop them and they know it.",conspiracy,Wuhan

&#x200B;

Hello.  My name is Chris.  I am nobody, really.  An average citizen.  I am an overweight 42 year old white male from the Midwestern suburbs of the US who has been fortunate enough to live a pretty comfortable life.  I used to be a freelance graphic designer with a focus on small businesses, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that that career and part of my life is more than likely over in light of current events.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

I've always been concerned about social injustice and tried to stay politically informed, even dabbling in some activism here and there.  At times I've stepped away from paying attention for my own mental health, or due to laziness, defeatism, whatever.  But I've never stopped caring, or trying, to fight the good fight and do the right thing.

The news recently has of course swept us all up, and touched all our lives in some way or another.  The world has never seen anything like the ""Coronavirus Pandemic,"" and it's clear that our society will be changed forever when we finally come out the other end of this mess.  But I've had the luxury of time recently, and in reading the news about things that were going on, I couldn't help but notice the patterns, and that a lot of stuff didn't exactly make sense.

So, here we go, with the ""conspiracy theory.""

I hate that term, because although it's technically accurate, it's been demonized and weaponized by the media and society at large to take on a bad connotation.  Tinfoil hats, alien abductions, crazy people muttering to themselves, etc.  You've no doubt got a lot of images in your mind of a conspiracy theorist.

And make no mistake, what I'm going to tell you here is all currently very popular conspiracy theory.  However, I think that by removing opinions and conjecture from it, and focusing on facts and things that have already happened, I can present this huge amount of overwhelming, disparate information in a way that makes it less a ""theory"" and more a ""research project.""  And so that is how I have approached this.

I have spent the last week doing little else besides reading every news and opinion article I could find, saving and organizing hundreds of links, and assembling a coherent, logical outline to organize and present these theories, and more importantly, facts.  There are a lot of less-than-reputable sites and publications out there, and I have tried when at all possible to provide sources from verifiable news sites, with a wide range of slants and focuses, to illustrate that what is happening is not part of any one particular political agenda.

I hope that you take the time to check the links, really look into the information presented here, and form your own opinions.  Please do not just take my word for it.  To that end, there are also a few links mixed in that are labeled as having come from r/conspiracy.  These are well-written and well-reasoned posts from other concerned citizens that I think are worth reading, and relevant to the discussion here.

One last thing - If you are new to most of these ideas, the information presented here is more than likely going to seem overwhelming at first.  I encourage you now, and always, to take mental health breaks for yourself, and put down your phone or turn off your computer.  The information will be here when you come back.  And as you'll soon understand, what is happening is an unstoppable tide, truly a force of nature at this point, and there is nothing you can do to fight it, so try your hardest to relax, put on some chill music, hug your dog, and most of all...

BREATHE.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you start researching conspiracy theory, you're going to find a lot of information.  Some much better or worse presented than others, and some much more plausible or unbelievable than others.  Despite the seeming ridiculousness of some things you might read, I encourage you to always approach new information with an open mind.

That said though, I have one main principle that guides all my beliefs about conspiracy theories, and that is the ""Filter of Likelihood.""  Essentially, you have to ask yourself how possible, how likely, and how feasible a piece of information is.  Furthermore, you need to ask yourself what the motivation would be.  In many cases, it's quite easy to see how something makes a lot of sense based on other known info, whereas some theories seem rather implausible no matter how you look at it.

I am interested only in the plausible, and where possible, the already actualized.  Additionally, there's a lot to be said, and a lot that has already been written on many of these topics, so I will focus on current events and simple concepts.

I will also ask you to open your mind to possibility.  Please consider this as you evaluate new information:

1. Do you believe there are things going on in the world that you don't know about yet?
2. Do you believe that there is technology and science you've never heard of?
3. Do you believe that society is progressing at an increasing rate?
4. Do you believe that as populations grow, we require new societal strategies?
5. Do you believe that those with power and money want to retain their power and money?

Of course you believe all these things, and none of these are wild or unusual concepts.  Rather, these are very basic concepts that apply to everyone, and always have.  They are all part of our shared human experience, and undeniable facts of life.  Populations grow, societies evolve, technology advances, and the world changes.  And most important to our discussion here, people, families, and empires constantly [jockey for power and control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-evIyrrjTTY), while fighting for resources, power, fame, and...

**MONEY.**

We all hate TicketMaster, right?  Who do they think they are, what the hell is this bullshit ""service fee,"" etc.  It's something everyone can get behind.  But did you know that TicketMaster willingly cultivates that image?  That venues, teams, and artists, in their pursuit of more money, [raise fees and then let TicketMaster be the bad guy and take the heat so their reputations remain intact](https://stubcrew.com/the-ugly-truth-about-ticketmaster-fees/)?

There are many more people, organizations, and other entities in the world playing that same role for those who really have the money, who really call the shots.  And those who call the shots work very hard and spend absolutely unfathomable amounts of money, time, and blood, to make sure that you don't ever realize who's actually taking your money.

They do this in the simplest, easiest way.  If you simply control information from the top down, and disseminate it when and where you see fit, you can effect great societal change without lifting a finger.

Please imagine... really, try to imagine...  You just read an article, saw a video, whatever, from a very, very reputable source.  And it just informed you that an asteroid was 83% likely to impact the Earth next month.  What would you do? What would happen in the world?

Hopefully an asteroid will not hit next month, but it's important to really imagine what would happen and why, and how.  Because a huge amount of information would be generated and published, people would panic, society would crumble, and the world as you know it would change forever in an instant, the moment you read that headline.

Control of information is one of the most powerful tools known to mankind today.  A person living in 2020 can easily encounter as much information in a day as someone in Medieval times might have encountered in a lifetime.  And it comes at you from all angles, in all forms, non-stop, 24/7.  Much like the water in the pipe, the information is always there, and one needs but turn it on.

Disseminating the information then becomes a practice all its own, and to be sure, [information processing accounts for more than half of the US GDP.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/shenk-data.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)   And the rate at which it's spread, and way it is handled makes a huge difference in the societal repercussions.  So a few different techniques are used:

* **The ""Slow Walk""** \- If a large, unexpected piece of information is given suddenly, people tend to react poorly and irrationally.  Also known as ""letting them down easily,"" this technique restricts the flow of information to prevent the audience from balking or being overwhelmed
* **The ""Steady Drip""** \- This technique involves keeping your audience subjected to a constant stream of the desired information, so that they become accustomed to it and it becomes ""normalized""
* **The ""Firehose""** \- A deluge of information flying out at full blast, designed to overwhelm the audience so that they cannot focus on anything else

It might be the greatest understatement of all time to say that there has been a lot of information passed around about COVID-19, the ""Coronavirus,"" recently.  In fact, there has never been anything like what we are currently experiencing in all of human history, and not by a long shot.  And this unprecedented turn of events has caused a lot of people to react in a lot of ways, and say and do a lot of things, for better or for worse.

Full disclosure: In particular, if you look up conspiracy theory, you'll see a lot of stuff suggesting that the ""Coronavirus is a hoax.""  (You'll also find a lot of poorly-written rambling)  I want to be clear that I DO NOT believe that.  I am 100% sure that there is a Coronavirus, that it is making people sick, that a lot of people are dying, and that our medical professionals and many other undervalued workers are overwhelmed, and breaking their backs every day to do their best to keep their friends, families, and loved ones safe.  I am extraordinarily grateful for them and admire the resolve and bravery that so many have shown in the face of this disaster.  I do not think it is a hoax at all.

However, I think that literally everything else that is happening surrounding the ""pandemic"" is.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**The Pandemic**

In the first week of January this year, I got sick.  Really sick.  I know when I got it and who I got it from, and honestly the exact moment I got it (I only was in proximity of the dude for a few minutes).  He had warned me that he was really sick, and I blew it off.  I started feeling sick a day or two later, and a day or two after that I felt like I was dying.  Fever, chills, aches, extraordinary fatigue.  And literal, nonstop, 24/7 coughing.   I had every single symptom of what we now know as COVID-19.  I commented to anyone who would listen that I didn't recall ever feeling that sick before in my entire life.  The most memorable part of it though was that after a couple days, I completely lost my sense of smell and taste.  Joked a lot about how you could feed me onions and soap cause I'd have no idea.  I try to have a good attitude about being sick.

I spent a week sleeping on the couch before I finally went to the doctor.  She gave me a Prednisolone steroid pack (which has worked well for me in the past), some Trazodone to knock me out, and Benzonatotate for my cough.  As soon as I took the first dose of steroids I started to feel pretty fucking great, and it was more or less a non-issue after that.

I spoke to a lot of people about it then and after, and man, I can't tell you how many stories I personally heard from people I know that said the exact same thing.  Then I started reading the same story over and over again on Reddit:

* [Please leave your experience from November-January if you were Extremely Ill](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjvtdo/please_leave_your_experience_from_novemberjanuary/)
* [An Illness swept through Utah back in December/Early January, was it Covid-19? Did this happen elsewhere?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fotr6p/an_illness_swept_through_utah_back_in/)
* [How long do you really think covid19 has been in the US?](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fjveej/how_long_do_you_really_think_covid19_has_been_in/)

We didn't start really hearing about the Coronavirus in the media until the beginning of March, and we didn't hear about the ""Pandemic"" until just a couple weeks ago.  And what a couple weeks it's been since then.  But I am quite certain that it's been around for a lot longer and that I, and a lot of other people I know, had it - and DID NOT DIE FROM IT - way back in January.

We now know that the [first documented case in the US was on January 19th,](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) but that word ""documented"" is so, so important here.  That means that we had identified the virus, developed a test, and tested a person with the symptoms that day.  It does NOT mean that was when the virus reached the United States.  How sick do you have to be before you take a day off work? Before you go to the doctor? With America's healthcare system or lack thereof, it's almost certain that many people had this virus before we determined what it was, and how infectious it really was.

There is also the matter of the statistics of severity vs the regular flu.  This is a highly contentious topic and I am no medical expert, and do not wish to make any assertions.  However, what I can tell you from my personal experience is this: I had a horrible ""flu"" in January, got basic medicine, got better.  So, either I had the flu, or perhaps I did indeed have the Coronavirus.

We will never know because I was never tested.  But the important thing is that it *doesn't matter.*  Either I (and many others) had the Coronavirus and it did not kill us (calling into question the severity of the infection) or we just had a bad cold or flu, but it had the exact same symptoms as COVID-19 (calling into question the extent of Coronavirus diagnoses).  But logically, one of those two statements is true.

Furthermore, the data keeps changing, and I don't mean increasing on a daily basis.  I mean up and down, back and forth, it is deadly or maybe it isn't, etc.  On January 14 [the WHO told you it couldn't spread from human to human.](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152)   But then on Jan 19 we saw the [first case of Coronavirus in the United States](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191).  Then it turns out that the [Wuhan market outbreak began earlier in December](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/03/26/Report-Wuhan-market-outbreak-began-earlier-in-December/3021585151249/?ds=5). And then it's an ""epidemic,"" but [most people will only get mild symptoms](https://www.newsweek.com/these-are-mild-coronavirus-symptoms-most-people-covid-19-will-get-1494376).  What are you supposed to believe?  And it sure does seem to come at you as a firehose, and it's hard to even think about anything because OHMYGODTHECORONAVIRUS!

But let's stop and look a couple basic facts.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to let Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi explain this one to you.  This is a very informative 10 minute video, watch it:

[Sucharit Bhakdi - Very clear math showing that the COVID statistics are being manipulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBB9bA-gXL4)

So 80% of people only experience mild symptoms, and we're crashing the economy for this?  The statistics aren't any more extreme than many other illnesses we've had over time, and we're crashing the economy for this?  It doesn't make sense until you consider that there are other factors besides just the virus at play.

[Wolfgang Wodard - Explaining how the statistics are being manipulated to cause panic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyuhbnPOI)

The media, and society at large is inundating you with terrifying information about the Coronavirus.  But if it's not as bad as we originally thought, then why?  We don't freak out about every illness that comes along, and we've certainly never in the history of civilization had over [1/3 of the global population locked down under mandatory quarantine.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/one-third-of-humanity-under-virus-lockdown/ar-BB11Fk7V?li=BBnbcA1)

And then there's the debate about where the virus came from.  We believe it came from a meat market in China, under unsanitary conditions.  The science behind a coronavirus making the leap from one species to another is well-established and researched, and it is a very likely scenario.  There are also conspiracy theories that state that China released it on its people intentionally, or even that the US military released it in China.  Again, we will never know exactly where this Coronavirus came from.  It may be natural, it may be man made, and there are very plausible paths for both.  I don't know what to believe myself.  So here I ask you to make your own judgement based on likelihood.

What we do know though is that the state of the world this virus has been unleashed on has played a major factor in its spread.  In 1950 the global population was 2.5 billion, and that has exploded to almost 8 billion people in 2020.  As a matter of fact, [population growth has been exponential since about the time of the Industrial Revolution.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)

With all these people on the planet there are sure to be many disagreements and conflicts, and there indeed have been.  As a matter of fact, 2019 saw global protests on an unprecedented scale, in Hong Kong, France, Syria, and many other countries.  Citizens have literally been [fighting police and military with rocks, clubs, arrows, and molotov cocktails.](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/17/780268841/hong-kong-protests-intensify-with-molotov-cocktails-and-arrows)

Did you know that?  Despite my seeing headlines and pictures every day of the riots in Hong Kong, I have been shocked to learn that multiple of my close friends, intelligent and aware people, had no knowledge whatsoever of the protests even existing.  But that is far from a coincidence; rather, it is quite by design.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Billionaires and Coincidences**

Another major talking point over the last 5 to 10 years has been the ""1%"" - the handful of super-rich individuals who posess and control the vast majority of the Earth's wealth and resources.  Where it used to just be a numerical term, ""Billionaire"" is now a dirty word, and one of the nastiest.  We all hate billionaires.  They are evil, and profit off the exploitation of the rest of the world.

The ""Illuminati"" we call them, in pursuit of a ""New World Order.""  Crazy stuff, right?  Mysterious symbols and people in black robes doing nefarious things in secret meetings, and running the world from behind the scenes.  We love the Illuminati, it's a huge pop culture thing now.  The subject of endless speculation, they are made fun of in the media, movies, and now Taco Bell commercials.  It's so far fetched it could never really be true.  And the fact that you think that is by design as well.

So, we don't know where the Coronavirus came from, but it's certainly here, and there are lot of other things unfolding in the world around it.  Many different current events from all different places and fields of study.  Some of it seems a little too coincidental.  It is certainly very coincidental that this economically destructive Coronavirus entered the world right as there were global uprisings, protests in the street, and a growing public hatred for billionaires.

Well, here are a few other coincidences:  [Hundreds of CEOs of major companies stepped down from their positions in recent months.](https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/the-great-ceo-exodus-of-2020/)  Multiple [US Senators sold stock right before the market crashed.](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market) Even the [boss of the New York Stock Exchange sold his own stock](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyse-jeffrey-c-sprecher-kelly-loeffler-sold-company-stock-ahead-of-coronavirus-market-meltdown/) right before the crash.  Did they know something they weren't telling us?

Here's another coincidence.  In 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation published a selection of future-predicting scenarios in the name of ""exploring the ways that technology and development could co-evolve.""  One of these four scenarios, entitled ""[Lock Step](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf),"" eerily predicts a global viral pandemic and the resulting hypothetical consequences, which almost exactly mirrors the COVID-19 pandemic we are in the midst of today.

Also coincidental: [The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in China on November 17th, 2019](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back).  Literally one month earlier, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted [Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY.  In this exercise, they discuss the potential implications and consequences of a novel Coronavirus, including an economic crash, martial law, and of particular interest, the control of information.  (You can view some published highlights [here](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html#highlights))

The [World Economic Forum is comprised of the richest of the rich.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Membership)  The 1%. The Billionaires.  CEO's, politicians, business owners, and many other powerful and influential figures.  They meet regularly to discuss topics of global concern, and [strongly control the dissemination of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos).  And of primary concern to many of them is maintaining their wealth and power in a rapidly-changing world.

And finally, here's one more coincidence:  At the exact same time as the Event 201 exercise, [The World Military Games was held in Wuhan, China, Oct 18-27, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Military_World_Games).  It was the largest military sports event ever to be held in China, with nearly 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries competing in 27 sports.  Wuhan China was, as we now believe, the source of our current global COVID-19 outbreak.

Whether you think it is a ""conspiracy"" or not, that is all certainly coincidental, to say the least.

***""Why didn't I hear about any of this?""***

That's an excellent question, and one that likely has multiple answers.  For starters, how much do you really pay attention?  Where do you get your news from?  Do you research things you hear or just accept them on hearsay?  Critical thinking skills are paramount in making sense of the chaos unfolding all around us.

As I mentioned before, I can tell you that I personally know multiple people who had no clue whatsoever about the riots in Hong Kong last year.  As you read this, you may be one of them.  And it may seem like something that is happening far away, and ""could never happen here."" Or you may have been aware of it but just that it was happening.  But please, consider for a moment: millions of average citizens risked their lives and safety in the streets of Hong Kong for months on end, fighting police and military, and transforming the city they lived in into a warzone.  WHY?  Why would people do something like that?  Regardless of their motivations, that many people were banding together to fight for something they believed in.  And that is worth considering.

It's not really your fault though that you may not catch wind of all this news.  The ""mainstream media"" that you hear about all the time deliberately controls information - downplaying threats and overreacting to silly things - in order to make sure that you hear the version of the news that they want you to hear.

Did you know that only [6 corporations control 90% of the media In America](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6)?  That number is reduced from 50 companies in the 80's.  And literally all the news you see on TV, at the very least, is 100% owned and controlled by these companies.  Lately, distrust is growing for cable news networks, and many people turn to their local hometown station for trusted news.  The problem with that though is that your hometown station is [probably owned by Sinclair Media](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17202824/sinclair-tribune-map), one of the most powerful broadcast networks in the country that you've never heard of.

Please watch this very brief video, illustrating the [chokehold that Sinclair Media maintains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/02/598794433/video-reveals-power-of-sinclair-as-local-news-anchors-recite-script-in-unison) over your nightly local news broadcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI)

Of course, not every piece of news is pre-programmed but a lot is.  The real news is out there, but sometimes you have to look a little deeper than the infographics on TV news.  Even if information is being directed from the top down, the boots on the ground tend to be passionate people with a variety of interests and agendas, and they are still doing their best to do real journalism despite corporate oversight.

Think of those who are directing the information as steering an impossibly massive ship with a rudder.  You can slowly adjust the course of direction, however it is slow to react.  If you want to stop, you have to start thinking about stopping wayyy ahead of time.  And similarly, once it gets underway, it is then influenced by an inertia all its own.  Micro controls and adjustments aren't really possible.

Our society is this giant ship.  There are 8 billion people on this earth - that is 8000 million.  An incomprehensible number that grows rapidly every day.  As civilization grows and advances, so does our medicine, our technology, our cultural norms.  These are all natural processes that are necessary to manage an increasing number of societies all around the globe.  And many of the advances we're making have exciting potential benefits for humanity, although as with all tools, they also inherently possess the potential for abuse.

Here are some other things happening in society right now, some you may be aware of and many you may not: 

* [RealID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) \- The Real ID law requires people to show security-enhanced IDs to pass through airport security checkpoints or to enter certain federal facilities.
* [Traffic Cameras](https://ggwash.org/view/76623/traffic-cameras-that-are-swift-certain-and-fair-could-enhance-safety-not-be-predatory) \- Most people know that there are traffic cameras in an increasing number of areas, some of which can assess your speed and issue you a ticket automatically.
* [Automation Everywhere](https://retailwire.com/discussion/robots-are-everywhere/) \- Beyond assembly lines, robots are continually performing more types of tasks from ever more companies, replacing human employees at an increasing rate.
* [Automated Trucks](https://interestingengineering.com/automated-trucks-are-coming-much-sooner-than-you-think) \- Autonomous trucks are coming soon that can see forward over a half mile, farther than any other autonomous system in the world, and run during the day, the night and even in the rain.
* [Global Satellite Internet](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/spacex-launch-starlink-coronavirus-scn/index.html) \- Elon Musk's SpaceX recently launched its fourth batch of internet-beaming satellites, as the company builds a broadband internet business by deploying thousands of satellites into orbit
* [Digital Rights Management](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/drm1.htm) \- Technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works, DRM technologies affect copyrighted works, digital media, and even [John Deere Tractors](https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-farmers-right-to-repair/)
* [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-are-cryptocurrencies) \- As digital payments become more and more prevalent, digital currency uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency.
* [Voluntary Nanochipping](https://www.businessinsider.com/swedish-people-embed-microchips-under-skin-to-replace-id-cards-2018-5) \-  People are having microchips implanted into their bodies so that they don't need to carry key cards, IDs, and even train tickets.
* [Programmable Viruses](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/21/yc-startup-felix-wants-to-replace-antibiotics-with-programmable-viruses/) \- As antibiotic-resistant bacteria becomes a greater problem, viruses are being engineered to fight the bacteria in targeted ways
* [Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/port-of-seattle-moves-toward-implementing-facial-recognition/) \- Airports are using facial-recognition cameras to confirm passenger identity.  Mobile phone makers are using face recognition for biometric security.  Retailers are using it to prevent violence and crime, and for advertising.
* [Thermal Scanners](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/03/thermal-camera-market-explodes-coronavirus-spreads/164050/) \- Airports, casinos, and grocery stores are screening passengers for sickness.  In China, this data is being used to control traffic.
* [ID2020](https://id2020.org/)  \- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is developing human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can contain financial data, medical records, tracking tech, and more.

There is an interesting chicken or egg relationship between science fiction and real world science.  Sci-fi writers are inspired by the real science of the day, then they apply their creativity to imagine what might be in the future.  Young scientists encounter these fantastical ideas and think they are worth pursuing, and then set about to make them a reality, and the cycle continues.

Futuristic concepts are then preempted and introduced through the media to the conscious mind, as we include them in books, movies, TV, video games, and more.  Eventually we start seeing headlines of these new technologies and developments happening in other places, usually Japan and China first due to their prevalence in the industrial and technological sectors of our global economy.

***""Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.""*** 


If you're an organisation with a long history and almost unlimited power and influence, such as ***""The Round Table Movement""***, ***""The Committee Of 300""***, ***""The Trilateral Commission""***, ***The Rosicrucians*** and similar;.

**HOW do you reduce the world's population down from 7.8 Billion down to 0.5 Billion *""in perpetual balance with nature""* practically?**

You own the Federal Reserve and have endless amonts of money and resources available to you, but since so few people in power, (ordinary politicians etc) are ***truly*** aware of your plans for an imminent population reduction, (or would want to go along if they knew what it meant), it's no easy task to reduce the world population by 7.3 Billion people. Not even if you have almost unlimited money, power and influence at your disposal, and assuming that you don't want to destroy the earth through a nuclear war or something similar.

It's especially difficult if you'd like to do it quickly, in a time span of a few decades or less. 

But you **ARE** the elite, and this is your #1 goal, so what do you do? 

**Is perhaps the easiest way to achieve your goal through the introduction of a man-made virus that causes widespread infertility?** 

You can still use a two-pronged (or more approach) with other options, but a virus that make humans infertile seems the most logical, and also the most humane way to reduce the population over the course of a generation or two.

To achieve that, more than anything ***you need a virus with a high rate of transmissibility***, because you want to get as many people as possible infected and there are millions of good Doctors, politicians and experts around the world who will do their best to try and stop any serious virus outbreak as soon as it happens. 

So apart from a highly transmissible virus you'll likely need the virus to be release in a closed country, like *North Korea* or *China*, where the virus can be allowed to take a foothold before serious measures against are started. 

Since *North Korea* is refusing to co-operate with your globalist agenda and can't be trusted China is likely your best choice for where to release the virus, and start the initial pandemic. 

**If you're at all humane and have *any* empathy, you'd also want a virus with a *""reasonably""* low case fatality rate, especially if you yourself plan to continue living on this planet for a few more years.**

The World normally sees around 55-60 Million deaths per year, and if we suddenly started seeing 1 Billion or more deaths in a year the world would truly *collapse*. 

The earth would quickly become virtually inhabitable for humans. Even just the process of removing corpses and burning/burying them would soon collapse, and people would be left to rot where they died. 

Not the kind of world you'd want to live in if you're an elite used to the most extravagant lifestyle imaginable, even if you have some amazing bunkers at your disposal. 

**No, what you want is to slow down the number of births through widespread infertility, and perhaps also cut the average lifespan by a decade or so, as a side effect of a highly transmissible virus but with a relatively low death rate.** 

Perhaps you can also reduce the lifespan by simply by causing some lung damage and blood clotting in the kidneys and other organs, since the nephrons in the kidneys never regain their function or recover once they've *""clogged up""*? 

**Does any of this start to sound familiar yet?Do we have a virus with these capabilities?**

Interestingly enough, very little serious research has been focused on how Covid19 affects infertility so far, but you can't stop researchers forever, even if you control almost all the funding... 

**So here is what we're now learning about the connection between Covid19 and infertility:**

***""The markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in sperm cells of men with COVID-19 were increased by more than 100% compared with controls, according to the researchers. Sperm concentration was reduced by 516%, mobility by 209% and sperm cell shape was altered by 400%.""***

https://www.healio.com/news/primary-care/20210129/covid19-reduces-fertility-in-men-study-suggests 

**And here is what some German researchers found a couple of months ago:**

***""Professor Donders and his team already have information about sperm quality . And it's not good news: fertility can be dramatically reduced. ""***

***""Researchers examined the genetic damage, the amount of sperm and the motility, the swimming power. ""The damage is impressive,"" says the professor.""***

***""The impact can be severe, with sperm counts as low as 10 percent of what is normal.""***

**I have predicted that this was a man made virus since back in January, although I was unclear on what the purpose of rhe virus was.**

***To kill millions of people?***

***To scare everyone enough that the elites can push through harsher laws (Patriot Act 2.0) and gain more control, (ban cryptocurrencies, ban end-to-end encryption and take control of the Internet etc)?***

***Or make people infertile?***

**How about a virus that can accomplish all of the above?**

That would be a *truly* successful ***false flag operation***, the biggest one in history, even counting 9/11 and several large wars. 

Tell me what you think? Is this what we're seeing, or do you think I'm a delusional conspiracy nut?

I am in a unique situation, I have money for motels but spend a lot of time on the streets anyways. I don't do drugs, I just smoke weed and play guitar. I stay in motels weekdays and just sleep in the car to save money on weekends, but I know pretty much every homeless person in my area. 

Covid doesn't exist on the streets. Homeless people live in camps together without masks, all do drugs together, share pipes, smoke cigarettes butts, and everyone just wears masks into stores. Most dumpster dive and social distancing just isn't a thing in the homeless communities so Covid should spread like wildfire.

One year ago before Covid was even a thing everyone got sick, like... really sick. At times I would have coughing fits and would get so out of breath it would actually worry me a little. I actually thought it was just a really bad flu after I quit smoking pot, and decided I should smoke it again medicinally and it really helped clear my lungs of the stuff that was causing my coughing fits. 

Everyone was sick, it was like what you would expect this pandemic to really be like. I was pretty much recovered when news of Wuhan and the virus hit. I was instantly worried and figured that is what the sickness had to be, but everyone I knew that got really sick was already over it and according to the news it couldn't have been Covid yet.  

Since then, nobody has gotten sick that I have seen. Not once during lockdowns have I even heard of anyone getting sick out here and I live in a densely populated area of southern california. The fact the everyone already got over the virus before it was even a thing, and that no homeless people have gotten sick while all doing drugs together, sharing pipes, not social distancing, and not wearing masks since then should tell everyone what they need to know about this pandemic.

I tell people the virus is/was real but just like chicken pox where it is better to get it young and develope an immunity than avoid it and get a more severe case later in life. If you haven't gotten Covid yet you probably will at some point in your life now, better young than old. 

Back in the 80's my mom took me to hang out at a kids house who had chicken pox just to get exposed to it while I was young to develop immunities for it. It was just a part of life and that's how people did it in the old days..... It sounds crazy now days, but it worked. Covid is probably very similar, it will probably end up being best to just get it when we are young and then not worry about it for the rest of our lives......it is called the ""IMMUNE system"" for a reason.",conspiracy,Wuhan

“Let’s also be clear: The future is not just happening. The future is built by us, a powerful community – you, here in this room. We have the means to impose this state \[of the future\] on the world,” Schwab said in a video [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kefalonitissa/status/1528761195120848898).

The German globalist’s message came amid remarks made by Bolsonaro on May 15. The strongman leading the Portuguese-speaking nation [voiced out Brazil’s explicit refusal to sign](https://welovetrump.com/2022/05/20/watch-jair-bolsonaro-says-brazil-will-not-sign-who-pandemic-treaty/) the WHO’s pandemic treaty, which grants the global health body overarching powers in the guise of addressing public health issues.

“Brazil will not get into this \[pandemic treaty\]. Brazil is autonomous and will not get into this, you can forget that. I’ve already \[spoken\] to our foreign relations cabinet and if that proposal goes forward, it won’t be with Brazil,” said Bolsonaro.

“Moreover, I was the only statesman that didn’t adhere to the lockdown policies. I said we had to take care of the elderly and people with comorbidities, and today’s studies outside of Brazil especially show that I was right.”

He cited the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example of the utter failure of lockdowns to curb the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“Check this out: Which state in Brazil locked \[down\] itself the most? Sao Paulo. Which state had the most deaths per 100,000 people? Sao Paulo. That’s a sign I was right.”

## Bolsonaro critical of COVID-19 guidance from the WHO

This was not the first time the Brazilian president crossed swords with the global health body – leading to Schwab castigating the strongman.

Back in October 2021, Bolsonaro and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus [tackled the world’s responses](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/who-director-recommends-against-vax-passports-admits-vax-does-not-stop-spread/) to the COVID-19 pandemic and their bigger repercussions. The two sat down during the G21 Summit that month, held in the Italian capital Rome.

The Brazilian leader started the ball rolling by asking if there was “prior consideration” on the global health body’s part when it implemented lockdowns and other measures. “All over the world, there are people who need to work to feed themselves,” he pointed out, adding that “the economy will collapse” if the lockdowns continue.

In response, Tedros said he does not see a need for Brazil to lock itself down due to the country’s high COVID-19 vaccination rate. Lockdowns were no longer necessary as long as Brazilians continue wearing face masks and washing their hands properly, he added.

Bolsonaro also questioned the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, claiming “many who got the second dose are getting COVID-19. In Brazil, many who got the second dose are dying.”

But according to Tedros, it was possible for vaccinated people to die if they had comorbidities. “The vaccine does not prevent COVID, but it does prevent serious illness and death,” he added.

Meanwhile, Schwab mentioned two conditions that were necessary to [bring about the Great Rese](https://globalism.news/)t he espouses. These came amid Bolsonaro’s refusal to work with the WHO to advance the globalist agenda.

“The first one is that we act all as stakeholders of larger communities instead of serving only our self-interest. That’s what we call stakeholder responsibility. \[The\] second \[condition is\] that we collaborate,” Schwab said.

Functionally, the COVID-19 viral form is American. Not Asian. America has five viral archetypes, China has one. If it is natural, it must come from that regional archetype. And the COVID-19 archetype is one of the five American types. It’s not the Asian archetype.

It cannot naturally arise in Asia.

Could this COVID-19 virus been in the Americas for most of 2019? Could it been floating around, getting people sick and killing people? Could it be misdiagnosed as other things?

A reminder. Dr. Fauci made an egregious mistake in his testimony to Congress on March 11 where he asserted that COvId-19 is 10x more deadly than influenza. He was comparing CFR to IFR. That one mistake may have set this whole thing ablaze.
https://alachuachronicle.com/mistake-or-manipulation/

1.) Dr. Fauci says he warned Trump in January that the US was in real trouble but that is not what he said publicly.

[In January Dr. Anthony Fauci told Newsmax TV that the United States “did not have to worry”about the coronavirus and that it was“not a major threat.”](https://archive.is/wip/cs2a5)

2.) Dr. Fauci warned of an apocalyptic coronavirus pandemic — then just weeks later he compared the coronavirus to a bad flu.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387

3.) Dr. Fauci based all of his predictions on models the that were OFF BY MILLIONS and then later told reporters,“You can’t really rely on models.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/02/experts-trumps-advisers-doubt-white-houses-240000-coronavirus-deaths-estimate/

4.) On March 20th Dr. Fauci jumped in and during a press briefing on hydroxychloroquine treatment for coronavirus [“corrected” the president](https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2020/03/20/fauci-dont-get-hopes-hydroxychloroquine-just-yet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) saying, “You got to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective.’ It was never done in a clinical trial… It was given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked.” 

Exactly two weeks later hydroxychloroquine was [deemed the most highly rated treatment for](https://www.sermo.com/press-releases/largest-statistically-significant-study-by-6200-multi-country-physicians-on-covid-19-uncovers-treatment-patterns-and-puts-pandemic-in-context/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) the novel coronavirus in an international poll of more than 6,000 doctors.

5.) [Dr. Fauci pushed these garbage models every step of the way.](https://archive.is/wip/ImkEB)

A month ago Dr. Fauci claimed 1 million to 2 million Americans would die from coronavirus. Then he said 100,000 to 200,000 Americans will die from the virus. Three weeks ago he agreed 81,766 Americans would die from the coronavirus. Then by that Wednesday Then by that Wednesday the experts cut the number of deaths to 60,415 projected deaths. to 60,415 projected deaths.

6.) On Easter Dr. Fauci suggested President Trump. [should have shut down the economy](https://www.the-sun.com/news/672794/fauci-lives-saved-us-shut-down-earlier/)  in February… When the number of known cases in the US was around 100. Fauci later walked back his attacks.

7.) Dr. Fauci said [cruises were OK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2020/03/09/fauci-says-cruising-is-ok-if-you-are-healthy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app#6635d6082d4d) on March 9th. That was a huge error.

8.) Dr. Fauci said  [malls, movies and gyms were OK](https://www.today.com/video/dr-fauci-on-coronavirus-fears-no-need-to-change-lifestyle-yet-79684677616) on February 29th. That was another huge mistake.

9.) Dr. Fauci was wrong about the first coronavirus deaths in the country. Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx and the CDC were off by nearly a month. California officials revealed in April that a patient in Santa Clara died from coronavirus on February 6th not February 29th.

https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Santa-Clara-county-coronavirus-February-deaths-15217371.php

10.) Dr. Fauci and the CDC missed the millions [and millions of US citizens who](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Santa-Clara-county-coronavirus-February-deaths-15217371.php) had already contracted the coronavirus before the draconian lockdowns took place. Knowing this could have prevented the economic calamity.

14.) Dr. Fauci warned that Georgia would see a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths by opening their economy too early.

------------------------
Looked up the study Fauci keeps referring to. Here it is

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207

Only 34% of participants had a positive PCR test. The remaining 66% either did not have a PCR test or actually tested negative.

This means that a positive diagnosis was made based on only SYMPTOMS for the vast majority of participants.

The participants were evaluated via an online survey and not actually seen by any medical personnel.

What happens if a large percent of the participants didn’t actually have COVID-19?

It would diminish the observed therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ probably isn’t going to help allergies or the common cold).

If the researchers had kept their original end point (hospitalization/death), the study would've actually shown a strong trend toward benefit for HCQ.

Instead, the researchers changed the end point mid-study from hospitalizations/death to symptoms at 14 days.

The conclusion of the study is actually a ~40% reduction in hospitalizations/deaths in patients treated with HCQ vs placebo (2.5% vs 4.1%).

Fauci's evidence for the inefficacy of HCQ comes from an online survey, cherry picking the metrics, under the guise of an RCT.

I'm going to post three pieces of evidence/information. The first one is pretty mainstream and the second is also pretty mainstream but the third might be controversial because of where it comes from yet I would say informative if you can look past that and just dig the facts out of it.  The first evidence is here where the former top science writer for the New York Times authors a peice about the lab leak theory: 

https://nypost.com/2021/05/09/theory-that-covid-escaped-from-a-lab-may-not-be-far-fetched/

Now in this is just a basic breakdown of the lab leak theory and how it's pretty possible that covid came from a lab. The most interesting things from this article would have to be that the first big stance against the theory back in February of 2020 came from Peter Daszack who as you will see later admits to funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology and says that they did coronavirus testing in China on video. 

The next peice of evidence is that EcoHealth Alliance has received at least $3.7 million from 2014 to 2020 and Daszack, who was a key member of the WHO-China joint study team, steered at least $600,000 in NIH funding that was originally signed off on my Dr Fauci, to the Wuhan lab for bat coronavirus research

https://taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/AwardDetail?arg_AwardNum=R01AI110964&arg_ProgOfficeCode=104

The last is from Infowars who I know is controversial but the information is actually compelling on its own. You have a video of Peter Daszack talking about doing Corona testing and also information about Dr. Fauci signing off on moving the testing from American to Wuhan.

Hypothesize a simulated global outbreak, required steps, various phases, overall timeline and expected outcomes
(Rockefeller - Lock Step, 2010).

 -Create a very contagious but super low mortality rate virus to fit the needed plan (SARS/HIV hybrid research strain created at Fort Detrick class 4 lab from 2008-2013 as part of a research project to find out why coronavirus's spread like wildfire in bats but have an extremely hard time infecting humans (hence the 4 HIV inserts, aka the missing key to infect the human ACE-2 receptor)

-Create a weaponized version of the virus with a much higher mortality rate as a ""BACKUP plan"" ready to be released in phase 3 BUT ONLY IF NEEDED (SARS/HIV/MERS weaponized tribrid strain created at Fort Detrick class 4 lab in 2015)

-Transport the research strain to a different class 4 lab (National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg Canada) and have it stolen and smuggled out by China (Shi Zhengli) on purpose and taken to China's only class 4 lab (Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan China) for added plausible deniability and to help cement the wanted BACKUP public script as something to fall back on IF needed (primary script being its natural, backup script being that China created it and released it by accident)

 -Fund all the talking heads (Fauci/Birx/Tedros...) and agencies (WHO/NIAID/CDC/UN...) that would be involved with pandemic response prior to the planned release of the research strain to control the wanted script throughout the operation.

 -Create and fund the vaccination development and roll-out plan so its capable of being rolled out on a global scale (Gates - Decade of Vaccines: Global Vaccine Action Plan, 2010-2020) 

-Create and fund the vaccination verification/certification protocols (Digital ID) to enforce/confirm the vaccination program after the mandatory roll-out is enacted (Gates - ID2020)

 -Simulate the Lock Step hypothesis just prior to the planned research strain release using a real-world exercise as a final wargame to determine expected response/timelines/outcomes (Gates - Event 201, Oct 2019)

 -Release the research strain at the Wuhan Institute of Virology itself and then blame it's released on a natural scapegoat as the wanted primary script (the Wuhan wet market, Nov 2019)

 -Downplay the human-to-human transmission for as long as possible to allow the research strain to spread on a global scale before any country can lockdown/respond to avoid initial infection

  -Once a country has seed infection in place, lockdown incoming/outgoing travel but keep the transmission within the country spreading for as long as possible

 -Once enough people in a country/region are infected, enact forced quarantines/isolation for that area and expand the lockdown regions slowly over time.

-Over-hype the mortality rate by tying the research strain to deaths that have little to nothing to do with the actual virus to keep the fear and compliance at a maximum (if anyone dies for ANY reason and is found they have COVID consider it a COVID death & if anyone is thought to of MAYBE had symptoms of COVID to assume they have COVID and consider it a COVID death).

-Keep the public quarantined for as long as possible to destroy the regions economy, create civil unrest, breakdown the supply chain, and cause the start of mass food shortages, as well as cause peoples immune system to weaken due to lack of interaction with other people/bacteria (the outside world... aka the things that keeps our immune system alert and active). 

-Downplay and attack any potential ""treatments"" and continue to echo that only a ""cure"" is viable to fight this virus (aka a vaccine)

 -Continue to drag out the quarantine over and over and over again (in 2 week intervals) causing more and more people to eventually stand up and protest/defy them.

-Eventually end the phase 1 quarantine once they get enough public push-back (~June 2020), and publicly state that they still think it's ""too early"" to end the isolation but are going to do it anyways. 

-Once the public go ""back to normal"" wait a few weeks and then continue to over-hype the research strain mortality rate (~Aug-Sept 2020), and combine it with the increase in deaths due to people dying from standard illnesses at a higher rate then normal due to having highly weakened immune systems from months of being in isolation, to help further ""pad"" the mortality rate and hype the upcoming phase 2 lockdown.

-Eventually enact phase 2 quarantines (~Oct-Nov 2020) on a even more extreme level and blame the protesters (mostly people who don't trust their government already) for the cause of the ""larger"" 2nd wave (we told you so, it was too early, this is all your fault cause you needed a hair cut, your freedoms have consequences...).

 -Enforce the phase 2 quarantines at a much more extreme level, increasing the penalty for defiance (replace fines with jail time), deem ALL travel as non-essential, increase checkpoints (including military assistance), increase tracking/tracing of the population (mandatory apps), take over control of food/gas (large scale shortages) so that people can only get access to essential products/services if they are FIRST given permission.

 -Keep the phase 2 lockdown in place for a much longer period of time then the phase 1 lockdown, continuing to destroy the global economy, further degrade the supply chain, and further amplify the food shortages, and alike.

 -Quell any public outrage using extreme actions/force and make anyone who defy's them appear as public enemy #1 to those who are willing to submit. 

-After a rather long phase 2 lockdown (6+ months), roll-out the vaccination program + vaccine certification and make it mandatory for everyone (giving priority access to those that submitted from the start), and have those that are for it attack those that are against it saying they are a threat and the cause of all the problems (we can't go back to normal until EVERYONE takes the vaccine... people defying them are hurting our way of life and therefore are the enemy).

 -If the majority of people go along with the agenda then let those people enter the new system (new normal) while limiting the minority that defy the agenda's ability to work/travel/live.

 -If the majority of people go against the agenda then release the weaponized SARS/HIV/MERS tribrid strain as phase 3, a virus with a 30%+ mortality rate as a final scare to push the minority to quickly become the majority and give a final ""we told you so"" to those that didn't listen.

 -Enact the new economy model (Microsoft patent 060606 - Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data) which is based on human behavior and willingness to submit (tweaked version of Black Mirror's ""Fifteen Million Merits"") using food/water/shelter and other essentials as a weapon of enforcement of the new economic system. Basically do what we want and get rewarded (gain credits/score and gain more access to things you need to survive) or go against what we want and get penalized (lose credits/score and lose access to things you need to survive).

  ...Welcome to the New World Order..  And I would like to add that if anyone thinks that this isn't true then check out parts of China, they already have the cryptocurrency system in place in certain areas..""",conspiracy,Wuhan

Thus systemically creating a population whom were infected as well as stopping panic that would spread. In retrospect you can clearly see that Swedish Government never wanted to control the virus, just the Narrative. After we got some cases the government expressed that the situation would not be temporary but may stay for years.

Effectively, first they worked toward silencing the alt media, that the virus from Wuhan was nothing more than a flu and then when we had cases in Sweden they quickly changed the narrative towards solidarity in times of need.

But, the Swedish government never enforced a lockdown despite of heavy pressure of neighboring countries and stated that in order to keep our economy we couldn’t lock down. That there was no way to justify a lockdown due to a virus that had 2-5 % death rate.

Instead we have “recommendations” on daily news conferences with the chief epidemiologist and other government officials. The most prevalent recommendation was “wash your hands more often”.

When asked about masks our chief epidemiologist said they weren’t worthless against the virus but not economically viable as masks would inflict psychological factors such as fear upon the Swedish population thus causing them to hold on to their money and not go to the mall, not go the cinema, to the pub etc.

Sweden “recommends” a lot but has effectively gone the economy over lives route. We have some of the highest death by covid rates in the world.

People here live as we did before covid, even me. We club , we party, we work We go the malls etc and buy stuff and as long as the people do that, the government won’t interfere as it keeps the economy rolling.

TLDR: My educated guess is that:

The Swedish government silenced early rapports of covid by alt media in order to not cause panic and stated that it was no more than a flu.

When the government had calculated the plan for Sweden, they quickly let people into Sweden whom the government knew where infected and then quickly changed the narrative to “ we must prepare to face this for years “.

Instead of locking down , they went with “futile” recommendations which they knew, no one would abide to. Thus going for the route of not stopping or controlling the disease at all, just doing the bare minimum to not let the hospitals get overwhelmed.

THIS IS THE MAIN POINT: The Swedish Government did not try to stop infected from coming in to the country or placing them under mandatory quarantine and repeatedly stated that they have a responsibility to the public as well as the economy. Thus systemically doing nothing at all to stop the spread in order to let everyone who might get sick, get sick.

Why ? So that Sweden could go through the pandemic as quick as possible in order to save the economy. As well as herd immunity.

There might have been great losses if look at our percentage but the Swedish notion has always been to leave a fully functioning society for those whom survive.

EDIT: Please understand that I am not stating “ my opinion “ as I am objectively viewing what has happened in my country. If you are against these type of strategies, please don’t downvote this post but reply with your opinion. As much misinformation is being spread that Sweden enforces masks, strict policies etc. Which in this case is not true. Sweden has a very extensive track record of maintaining an image outward and doing something else such as Sweden being “neutral” during WW2 or that Sweden currently controls more than 2 % of the worlds military arms industrial market while maintaining a “pacisifist” image outward.

EDIT 2: I posted a new reply to this post which you can find under “new replies” which addresses some of the thoughts you might have on the pandemic and goes further into detail of the Swedish public view and Swedish immigration and arms issue.",conspiracy,Wuhan

But now I’m facing two options:

Either Get Vaccinated.

Or Wear a Mask for the rest of my Life.

I chose neither. 

Remember at the beginning Fauci recommended no to Masks! He also said the same thing in his Emails. The beginning was the height of the “Pandemic”. When we knew the least about this Bio Weapon from the Chinese Wuhan Lab. 

Healthy People don’t wear masks.

Healthy People don’t take drugs with unknown Long Term Side Effects. 

It’s very interesting to me how the narrative has switched so drastically. They no longer mention essential workers anymore. They only mention the unVaccinated. An how they are a threat to Society! I’ve experienced this Mind Control in my own life. You mention you are unvaccinated and people get all weird. You don’t have a mask on and people get all weird. The effects of the media mind control are present at work and in my personal life. 

Funny how we’ve gone from Vaccine Passports are a Conspiracy Theory to Vaccine Passports on Steroids. And this all happens after the G7 summit. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Qatar, Israel etc., All seem to be doing the same policy. So far in America only NY and California have a fully functioning State Approved Vaccine Passport System. While most of the Republican States were quick to ban them. Why are Democrats so eager to make sure this happens? I live in New York State. And NYC controls NYS. Not Albany. If something happens in NYC it’s only a matter of time before it’s copied throughout the whole state. 

And recently Bill Deblasio who was a mainstream DNC Presidential Candidate is ACTUALLY saying out loud that he wants companies to start mandating the Vaccine. He also wants to copy the FRENCH Vaccine Passport system. And we all know on this sub 100,000 people are protesting that in France. It’s not willful ignorance. They know what’s going on. This is a pure Draconian Dictatorship. Deblasios stance is not fringe. He is openly saying this. Every woke issue he is for the mainstream Democrats are for. I have a feeling NYS will be the 1st to fall to this Orwellian nightmare. Followed by California depending on the outcome of the Governors race. 

Have you ever heard of a Pandemic of the unVaccinated? I haven’t. The narrative is so retarded people are actually buying it. The moment they started bringing back “Mask Mandates” in Cities is to prep for Lockdowns and Vaccine Passports in America.",conspiracy,Wuhan

Four years ago, [I wrote a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/55b0lt/a_storied_hong_kong_newspaper_feels_the_heat_from/d89eb67/?context=3
) defending the SCMP as a reliable news source on China-related matters:

>However, I won't deny that there are sometimes clear signs of editorial decisions being influenced by the establishment, like the lawyer's ""confession"", and that there might be a slow and insidious ideological creep towards the CCP party line, but because of the core audience of the paper, which consists of expats and relatively well-educated, mostly western-minded readers, they can't be quick or overt, or they risk losing their prestige and readership.

>This is why I think the SCMP's in a sweet spot right now, where it offers coverage and opinions from both sides of the ideological divide, and from both halves of the geopolitical world. Whether the paper will continue to stay in this sweet spot is something I can only guess at, but it seems to me as though there are few incentives for it to move out of its current general position within the next few years.

I again defended the paper [two years later](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/8bpwvh/a_thread_about_englishlanguage_chinese_news/dx9o5xm/), then quoted my initial comment in defense of the paper [nine months ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/g8veg8/china_braces_for_international_backlash_in_a/foqz630/), saying that the part about it being in a ""sweet spot"" still stood. 

&nbsp;

Today, I'm here to say that the SCMP has moved out of the ""sweet spot"" and will provide arguments and evidence supporting this claim. Some might say that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, or that I'm stating the obvious, but I feel it's important to update this piece of information to reflect reality, so on top of educating would-be readers of the paper, this is also a post for my conscience and integrity.

&nbsp;

Some of you might be thinking, ""Who is this person and why should we care?"" 

&nbsp;

[I made a ton of posts](https://old.reddit.com/user/San_Sevieria/submitted/) on /r/geopolitics from March to June of last year, along with high-effort submission statements, to spread awareness of China's role and behaviour in the ongoing pandemic--mostly to do my part in countering disinformation. The vast majority of these posts were based on SCMP reports, which I continued to feel at the time were reliable (and because negative news pieces on China are far more credible and convincing when they come from a reputable paper owned by a Chinese company than, say, Fox News). I might have posted more SCMP articles on the subreddit than all other users combined, possibly increasing its exposure and perception as being reliable and impartial.

&nbsp;

I began observing anomalies around April. It is very likely during that this time that authorities had felt the paper crossed a line with its unfavorable articles regarding China's role in starting the pandemic, its subsequent behaviour, and its outlook, and began subtly clamping down. It was also around that time that I started reading RTHK (a public outlet also based in the city) and other sources to diversify my intake, but also to compare their coverages and find discrepancies.

&nbsp;

What first caught my attention occured in a series that explored ""the global backlash that China may face as a result of its actions and rhetoric during the coronavirus pandemic"", which I posted to the /r/geopolitics (links in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gavcjk/who_is_winning_the_chinaus_race_to_run_the_world/fp1zwdf/)). At the time, [I wrote](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gavcjk/who_is_winning_the_chinaus_race_to_run_the_world/fp1zwdf/?context=3):

>I noticed how this series started off as something that would be both highly prominent and regularly featured under the SCMP 'Spotlight' section, and this is evident in the articles--the blazing-hot topic, the feature length, the deeper research, the commissioned artwork, etc. As the series progressed, its later pieces were published with basically no fanfare--not only were latter pieces published in an extremely rushed manner (Dates of publication: April 24, 28, 28, 28 ,29), the third one --which is about China's role in the global economy yet only had CCP members and nationalists as its sources and interviewees-- was 'spotlighted' (and still visible on the scmp.com front page at the time of writing) while the second, fourth, and fifth --which were far less China-friendly-- were basically buried at birth or immediately overshadowed.

Though this was redacted due to various issues, further observation showed this to be true. I didn't bother redacting my redaction as the post was already old.

&nbsp;

In July, the CCP imposed the National Security Legislation on the city where the paper is based. Though this alone doesn't make the paper unreliable, the legislation [includes provisions on media outlets](https://www.fcchk.org/correspondent/hong-kongs-national-security-law-implications-for-journalists/). The intent to rein in the media is clear--examples have been made, are still being made, and will in all likelihood continue to be made, so editorial independence is jepoardized through external and internal means (self-censorship). The government has also publicly confronted Jack Ma (founder of SCMP's parent company Alibaba) [with Xi personally approving the move](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-antgroup-ipo-idINKBN27S31I), which will likely translate into greater oversight over the paper. On top of all of this is increased pressure to push nationalism, which means this greater oversight will likely be exercised. In short: the bigger picture portrays a paper destined to push the party's narrative--though in a softer and more refined manner than outlets like Global Times.

&nbsp;

There are other clear warning signs in the coverage. For instance:

&nbsp;

* A substantial and consequential contradiction between official police statements given at different dates regarding a key moment in the 2019 unrest was noted in an RTHK article but not in relevant articles by the SCMP.

&nbsp;

* Most recently, the paper omitted coverage of the first anniversary of Dr. Li Wenliang's death. On a slow news day, there wasn't a single article on this major event (at the time of writing). Instead, Dr. Li was briefly mentioned in a routine coronavirus update while an SCMP editorial published on that day stressed global failings and said that there shouldn't be politicization of the pandemic.

* This is particularly troubling, because as late as December, the outlet still found it appropriate to publish articles like, '[Remembering Li Wenliang: the Wuhan doctor who warned the world about the coronavirus](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3115445/remembering-li-wenliang-wuhan-doctor-who-warned-world-about-coronavirus)'. It should be remembered that the CCP had started to take action against Jack Ma (founder of parent company Alibaba) around this period. __This change is a major indicator of the direction the SCMP is heading in.__

&nbsp;

There are other examples of omission, massaging, and favoritism that becomes evident when reading SCMP alongside RTHK and other outlets, but an exhaustive list of them is not feasible for obvious reasons. Had any of these occured in the opinions section, I wouldn't have thought much, as the opinions section is by definition built on biases--however, the incidents occured in its reporting. Given the general trends and the bigger picture, it's highly unlikely that the paper can genuinely change its direction. This is not to say we should throw out the baby with the bathwater, as the paper does a lot of high-quality and accurate journalism and has stellar infographics, but it should be clear that the paper is no longer as trustworthy as it once was on matters related to China, and that this is virtually guaranteed to worsen over time (pardon the premature title).

&nbsp;

This article is not an attack on the good folks who work at SCMP--they are victims of their circumstances and are no doubt under serious pressure. I reckon they'd done a good job of sticking to their principles; especially over the past two eventful years--if anything, they should be praised.

&nbsp;

Also note that this report is not an endorsement of RTHK as a replacement for the SCMP as a source of relatively-neutral news, as the scope of news of the smaller and diversified institution is different from the city's historical 'paper of record', that's backed by a technology giant. More importantly, on top of the imposement of the National Security Legislation, [the public station](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1518485-20200402.htm) [has been under siege](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1558268-20201104.htm) [by the pro-government camp](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1574040-20210204.htm) [since the unrest](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1558370-20201104.htm) [in the city two years ago](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1571828-20210122.htm). Given the power disparity, it, too, will eventually be brought to heel.

&nbsp;

To borrow a saying from talk-show hosts: ""There's a saying in American politics: 'There is nothing in the middle of the road except yellow lines and dead armadillos.'"" It seems that news readers are being increasingly forced to choose between extremes, since the middle ground is being increasingly hollowed out. If forced to choose, readers who read to gain knowledge would go with what they see as the lesser of two evils: the one less likely to contain falsehoods.

1,Some thoughts on China's initial handling of COVID19,1154.0,fnvvh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/fnvvh8/some_thoughts_on_chinas_initial_handling_of/,302.0,1585011548.0,"One part of the ongoing discussion and debate about the COVID19 pandemic has revolved about how China handled the initial emergence of it in Wuhan.

I have a few thoughts of my own, for what mistakes were made, and on the issue of ""cover-ups"".

My background; I moonlight as a PLA watcher and Chinese geopol commenter on this Reddit account and you may have read some of my PLA-related pieces on *The Diplomat*. Full disclosure, I'm not a virologist or epidemiologist, but I've been following this story since about early January and for my day job I am a junior doctor, so like to think I have some training to make sense of some of the disparate pieces of information both on the medical side as well as Chinese language/politics side of things.

====

First of all, to get it out of the way, IMO the PRC handling of COVID19 did have mistakes and flaws, specifically in terms of *speed*, such as:

* Speed of conveying information from regional to national health authorities.
* Speed of processing information and actioning plans.
* Speed of confirming key characteristics of the virus; such as human to human (H2H) transmission, sequencing the genome of the virus, etc.

But at this stage I don't think there is any evidence of deliberate or systemic ""cover-up"" of the virus as described in some threads. There seem to be three particular main accusations of ""systemic cover-up"" that I've seen: Censorship; reporting of H2H transmission; and Destroying of Samples. I have some thoughts on these below.

====

**Censorship**:

* By now the name of Dr Li Wenliang is infamous when talking about China's handling of COVID19, as an example of a whistleblower. A number of other doctors were also reprimanded for ""spreading rumours"" in early January, and overall state media reporting of the virus was very strict with significant censorship regarding the details of the ongoing investigation and information that the government had at hand.
* I personally believe that the censorship of Dr Li and some other doctors was *unhelpful*, however I also do not believe this is evidence of a deliberate or let alone systemic ""cover-up"". The initial [timeline](https://i.imgur.com/YNOCI5w.jpg) (graph from [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_home)) of actions to investigate the ""unusual cases of pneumonia"" show  health authorities were already in the mix and had communicated their initial information with the WHO in early January -- at the same time as they were actively censoring various posts on social media about the new pneumonia/novel virus. In fact, it was someone else in Wuhan -- Dr Zhang Jixian who first noticed the cluster of strange pneumonia on about 26/27th December and alerted health authorities and prompted them into action.
* If Dr Li had made his posts with the deliberate desire to warn the public that nothing was being done to investigate the new cluster of infections, then I would strongly agree that he should be described as a whistle-blower and that the government's actions to censor him (and other social media posts) were out of a desire to do a ""cover-up"". But in the context of the investigations going on before and after Dr Li made his Wechat post (December 30), I think the censorship around the time of early January is an ethical question of weighing the costs and benefits of releasing yet to be verified information to the public earlier -- **versus** waiting to verify information and then conveying that information to the public later.
* Authorities went for the latter choice, and even now, over two months later I'm not sure if their choice was better or worse.
   * Disclosing un-verified information to the public might've resulted in more cautious voluntary social distancing and sanitary behaviours by the public, which may have reduced the spread of the disease...
   * But OTOH it also may have caused more people in Wuhan to panic and leave the epicenter than otherwise, potentially distributing many more cases around the country (and around the world) before the government had the verified information to put in proper lockdown or quarantine measures in place.
   * I'm sure we can all appreciate that putting in a lockdown of the scale they eventually did, is not something that can be made without significant, verified information and intelligence.
* Dr Li of course was a hero, but IMO he was a hero for being one of the first (and unfortunately likely one of the likely-to-be-many) frontline HCWs that gave their lives to combat the pandemic.
   * Given what we know the authorities were actively working on behind the scenes however, I do not think his Wechat post in his private group (which he asked to not be shared publicly) was a case of trying to blow a whistle on what the government *wasn't* doing.
   * Instead, he was trying to warn some close friends and colleagues to keep a heads up on what he initially thought were cases of SARS (he was wrong on that count but very close given COVID19 is caused by another coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2) -- but someone in that group distributed his warning without his consent. The local authorities ended up pinning the blame on Dr Li, which of course was in turn criticized by higher national authorities and with various levels of more formal countermanding recently.
* There are also bigger ethical questions about the costs versus the need for censorship in terms of having transparency but also the enabling of disinformation to spread. For COVID19 itself even on Chinese social media, even now there are still cases of significant disinformation either deliberate or accidental, which companies have to actively [inform](https://www.weibo.com/weibopiyao?is_hot=1) their userbase of. (My personal favourite was a post going around in late January that the PLAAF was going to be sent in to cover Wuhan with disinfectant from the air.)

====

**Human to human (H2H) transmission**:

* One of the other main arguments about the ""cover-up"" is that the H2H potential for the disease was actively buried. I believe this news has re-emerged in the last week or so with some health professionals in Taiwan saying they were ignored by the WHO after received statements from colleagues in Wuhan about the disease being H2H transmissible.
* This particular argument is dicey as well, because it is easy to argue in hindsight that obviously the virus is H2H capable. But when the initial cluster of cases presented, it was still under investigation if it was from a specific source and whether there was ""sustained"" H2H transmission versus ""limited"" H2H transmission.
* In hindsight, we can easily argue that the investigation and waiting for [confirmation](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/20/c_138721762.htm) of sustained H2H transmission wasted time that could've been used to act sooner -- and I agree with that. In future, lessons might be taken to err on the side of caution to take strong measures even if a disease is thought to initially have ""limited"" H2H transmission.

====

**Destroying of samples**:

* This argument is a bit more recent but also a bit more easily examined. An article by Caixin documenting various steps in which the virus was initially investigated, has started to make some rounds in the English language media. Specifically, the part where various labs were ordered to destroy their samples of the virus on January 3rd. This order is seen as an example again, of the government ordering a cover-up and burying their head in the sand.
* But if one reads the original [article](https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/TWF2020022701654200?f=newdc), and looks at the relevant part [here](https://i.imgur.com/2DU8lnA.jpg), the actual order asks various labs to hand over samples or destroy their samples to other institutions. Presumably this was in relation to wanting to centralize and streamline efforts to investigate the virus samples, but also if some labs didn't have the requisite biosafety level to investigate the virus safely -- when they realized how dangerous the virus was, it likely would've been judged to be ""too hot"" for certain labs to handle.
* It is also rather telling IMO that on the same day (January 3rd) that the notice for labs to handover their samples to designated institutes or destroy them, the National IVDC [identified](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e3c63ca9-dedb-4fb6-9c1c-d057adb77b57) the sequence of the coronavirus themselves -- i.e.: that yes, while a number of labs were judged to be no longer capable of handling the virus, others would be continuing and centralizing their work on it.

====

Based on the above, I think the evidence and arguments at present don't indicate that there was any systemic cover-up where the government was seeking to avoid going public with information that they had already verified or confirmed internally -- rather they themselves were waiting for their investigations to present verified results, meaning they were shutting down public revelations of information they deemed to be un-verified. This again becomes an ethical question of benefits vs costs as aforementioned.

Going back to the ***flaws*** in the system, I think it was primarily around speed. If this were another, less virulent disease with a more distinctive presentation and a shorter incubation time, I think the authorities' reaction speeds would've been able to manage it.

But the virus gets a say as well.

We are likely to see articles and investigations going forwards to find when patient zero may have been (one recent article suggests the earliest case with retrospective testing may have been in November). However, by the time there were *enough* cases of this disease to alert health authorities that *something weird is going on*, and by the time their investigations were able to verify the key characteristics of the virus -- it was already preordained that it would cause a disaster in Wuhan at the epicenter.

Hindsight is 2020, but sometimes nature moves faster than the speed of human health bureaucracy and the present speed of human science. That isn't to say they can't ameliorate some of the flaws; in particular streamlining the bureaucracy further. On the political side of things, IMO that is likely strengthen Xi's reforms to further enhance central government power.

And in case anyone asks -- yes, I do trust China's numbers for tracking the disease, in the sense that I believe the numbers they have are the true ones they have internally and they're not ""secretly hiding"" the ""true number"".

Initially the lack of testing capacity meant they were inevitably under-counting cases (unfortunately being repeated now in multiple other places too), but I think they have a handle on it now and even if the exact pin point numbers aren't perfect I believe in the overall trend. The fact that they added ""15,000"" cases on February 13th as a result of changing diagnostic criteria to include patients diagnosed via CT due to a lack of testing kits -- IMO -- is evidence that national health authorities aren't afraid of looking bad if it can better capture the clinical reality.

\------------

Finally, it is possible evidence may emerge in the future that attempts to deliberately cover-up the disease **were** made -- but the major arguments for it at this stage IMO do not point to such a case.",geopolitics,Wuhan

This, to me, is a significant indication of weakness and disorganization, and is remarkable because the Chinese usually place high value on the perception of unity. When combined with the fact that the Chinese military has almost no actual combat experience, it suggests a lack of both willingness and ability when push comes to shove. The latest Pew poll (June 30) shows that unfavorable views of China among advanced economies are at or near record highs, and any conflict can be construed as resulting from the Foreign Ministry's running list of gaffes that has grown exponentially since it began broadly engaging in Wolf Warrior diplomacy at the start of the Wuhan Virus pandemic. 

&nbsp;

Assuming this divide between the Foreign Ministry and the PLA is real: How would it play out in the event of a war? Is the PLA readying a 'Get out of jail free' card? Is this part of a larger strategy to keep conflicts from turning physical, which would be gravely disadvantageous to China from a geopolitical perspective?

**Chapter One, India is big trouble for China in the future**

Today, China faces significant problems on its borders, totally surrounded by strong neighbors. The United States has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security. Russia. although it has a small population, has a large geographical advantage . Although Sino-Russian relations are good in the short term, it could be a big variable in the long run. However, an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is India. India is very weak on the surface, but has a greater potential for development. If you take the long-term view, India is likely to be a significant power in the future.

One reason many people like to laugh at India is that in the 1980s, the economic strength of China and India was evenly matched, but after China’s reform and opening up, China’s economy grew rapidly, and China’s GDP is now five times that of India. This shows how slow India’s economic growth is. However, if you compare it on a global scale, you can actually find that India’s economic growth is not slow. Since 1980, India’s GDP has increased 30 fold. In contrast, the GDP of other developing countries except China and India has only increased 10 fold, and the GDP of developed countries has even increased 8 fold. To a certain extent, it is not that India’s economic development is slow, but that China’s economic growth is too fast. ***China’s economic achievements conceal India’s economic miracle. If there is no comparison with China, then India’s economic growth can be considered a global miracle.***

On the other hand, China’s rapid economic growth has not come without a price. Due to strict family planning rules, China today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time. India has not implemented such a strict family planning policy, and the proportion of young people is very high. Although this has dragged down economic growth, India’s demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years. We know that young people are the main creators of social wealth, and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of China. To some extent, if the number of young people in India is twice that of China in 2050, even if India’s per capita output is only half of China by then, India’s GDP will be on par with China and become the world’s top three economies.

A power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated, although India is a very weak country at the moment, and the lower limit is low; but the future development potential is very large, the upper limit is very high. Although China is now flourishing, if one day the country is facing an aging crisis, on one hand, fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers, on the other hand, the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time, the national willingness to fight is reduced. At that time, it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising India than it is now.

**Chapter Two, the conflicts between China and India can hardly be reconciled**

It is difficult to reconcile the China-India conflict, just as it was difficult to reconcile the China-Soviet conflict before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The underlying reasons are not explained by ideology, territorial disputes, cultural differences, or foreign policy.

In the 1960s and 1980s, China’s greatest threat was from none other than the Soviet Union. If a torrent of Soviet tanks goes south from Mongolia, it will hit Beijing within a week. Since ancient times, the greatest external threat to China has been from the North. And in modern times, Soviet Russia has assumed this role. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks. This was similar to ancient cavalry, fast and ruthless, able to tear a hole in the opponent's defenses in a very short time

The key issue is that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained absolute geographic superiority . The Soviet Union not only controlled the outer northeast, but also Mongolia. When the Soviet Union did not control Mongolia, if the Soviet Union wanted to attack China, it still had to go south from the Northeast Plain and enter North China after conquering the Shanhai pass. But with control of the Mongolian Plateau, the Soviet Union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking China. Soviet tanks only had to cross the Yinshan Mountains to enter Hebei. After that, Beijing would be basically insecure to defend. In this case, China may only have to move south like the Central Plains dynasties in the past, and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the Soviet army.

This is the fundamental reason why China would fight with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and cooperate with the West without hesitation. As long as Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, China’s national defense cannot be assured. Thanks to an independent mongolia, China and Russia are moving towards reconciliation, in the long run, due to Russia's natural geopolitical suppression, it is still a potential threat, and China and Russia still guard against each other.

Taking the example of the Soviet Union, we can understand why Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile. ***The geography of India is very similar to China The main population centers of China are on the North China Plain, and Beijing is the throat into the North China Plain. The population centers of India are on the Ganges Plain, and New Delhi is the throat to enter the Ganges Plain. The south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline, and the southeast has a large island like Sri Lanka.***

But compared to China, India's geography is extremely bad. All of the core areas of India are in the hands of other countries (Indus river, Lower Ganges, Siri Lanka). India does not have many natural barriers. The coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west, while China only needs to defend the east. This makes India very easy to invade as seen in history. ***This is the reason why India invaded Tibet in the 1960s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time. It cannot be said that India is a militaristic state, but because in the context of geographical disadvantages, it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents.***  
For India, China is the biggest geo-threat. This is because China not only controls the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but also is an ally with Pakistan. Once China and India go to war, India will almost certainly lose without external intervention. India’s Ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage. The geographical disadvantages of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the alliance between China and Pakistan are part of the reasons why China-India relations cannot be reconciled. ***But in the long run, even if China and India can complete the territorial conflicts and China and Pakistan no longer are allies, it will be difficult for China and India to reconcile completely. The reason is that both China and India want to become superpowers and leaders in Asia, inevitably leading to strategic collisions.***  
In the future, if both China and India want to rise up and become leaders in Asia, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise. The key point of the conflict is Southeast Asia, the backyard of both counties. Southeast Asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries. Forming battlegrounds for any major countries. China and India both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region. Southeast Asia has many Chinese and Indians. To a certain extent, Southeast Asia is to China and India what Latin America is to the United States, Eastern Europe is to Germany and Russia, and North Korea is to China and Japan. They belong to the range of interests that must be contested.

Therefore, if both China and India become stronger in the future, they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in Southeast Asia. On land, India can rely on the northeast states to infiltrate Myanmar and radiate to the Indochina Peninsula. On the sea, India can rely on the Andaman Islands to increase its influence on the Southeast Asian islands. This is similar to China. On land, China relies on the Trans-Asian Railway/Pan-Asian Highway to increase its radiation to the Indochina Peninsula, and on the sea, it relies on the Nansha Islands to increase its influence on Southeast Asia.

***Therefore, Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile unless three conditions are met: 1. China withdraws from Tibet, or the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau becomes a neutral buffer area similar to Mongolia; 2. China abandons support for Pakistan; 3. China and India abandon the competition for Southeast Asia. None of these three items can be done by China. Tibet is an indivisible part of our territory. Although India has long supported ""Tibet independence"", it is impossible for China to give up Tibet. It is also impossible for China to give up support for Pakistan, Because once you let India unify South Asia, India will be the spearhead aimed at our country. Even more difficult to deal*** ***with. It*** ***is also impossible to give up Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is our natural economic backyard, and has economic and military dual significance.***

In the short term, the main contradictions are 1 and 2, but as India's national strength over Pakistan get bigger and bigger, we cannot rule out that one day Pakistan will be completely defeated by India or even annexed, by that time China's direct geopolitical threat to India will be greatly reduced, if India can also annex Nepal, Bhutan and other countries, then it will have a pivot point in the Tibetan Plateau, and it will be difficult for China to go over the Tibetan Plateau to directly invade India. At this time, the Sino-Indian territorial dispute will no longer be the main conflict, and the main conflict will change to a struggle for spheres of influence.

***The nature of India's threat is the same as that of Russia and Japan; it is a territorial and existential threat. India, on the one hand, has ambitions to encroach on our territory, which is different from the United States, which focuses on economic interests. India also has attempts to dominate South Asia and encroach on Southeast Asia. When China is strong, both the United States and India will adopt a hostile policy toward China; but when China is in decline, the United States may relax its restrictions , but India will not. If one day India is strong and China is weak, then India will intensify its aggression against our territory and even threaten the safety of our national life and property.***

**Chapter Three, the dilemma of two-front warfare, China does not occupy an absolute advantage on the Sino-Indian border**

***The Chinese front is too long and needs to be guarded separately.***

To the east is Japan and South Korea, to the southeast is Taiwan that has not yet returned, to the south are the Southeast Asian countries with territorial disputes, and to the north is Russia, which has occupied the most territory in China in history. In the west of our country, the situation is more complicated. There are religious and ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang and Tibet, and India is eyeing them. This means that although our country is strong, it needs to be guarded by separate troops

Division of Chinese theaters and deployment of forces:

Northern Theater -- 3 army groups, North Sea Fleet-- Russia, Korean Peninsula

Eastern Theater -- 3 army groups, East China Sea Fleet, half of the air force-- U.S., Japan, Taiwan

Southern Theater -- 2 army groups, South China Sea Fleet-- United States, Southeast Asian countries

Central Theater -- 3 armies-- Guards the capital and reserve for other war zones

Western Theater-- 2 armies-- India

Division of Indian military districts and deployment of forces:

Northern Military District -- 3 army groups -- Kashmir, the western section of the China-India border

Western Military Region -- 4 army groups -- Middle section of the China-India border

Eastern Military Region -- 3 armies, East Sea Fleet -- Eastern section of the China-India border

Central Military Region -- 1 army -- Guarding the capital

Southwest Military Region-- 1 army --- Pakistan

Southern Military Region -- 2 armies, West Sea Fleet -- Guarding South India

India can use most of its military power against China. The Indian army has 1.15 million troops and has a total of 14 armies, of which 10 are dedicated to fighting China, accounting for 70% of its army. As for the navy, when a war breaks out between China and India, if the United States and India have good relations, India can send its entire navy to the Andaman Islands to block the Strait of Malacca. While most of the Chinese navy will be deployed in the Pacific to confront the United States and Japan. In terms of air force, northern India has a flat terrain and numerous airports, which can accommodate all the fighters of the Indian Air Force. However, there are not enough airports in Tibet to park a large number of fighters. ***If a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, how much force can be used to fight against India?***

It may be difficult for China to deploy troops on a large scale to support the battlefield, because each army group has clear responsibilities. Once a large number of troops are deployed, it will inevitably lead to weakness and give other countries a chance. For example, the 82nd Army is used to guard the capital , the 82nd Army is equipped to fight on the Great Plains, its plateau combat ability is not a strong point  
***This means that once a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, we may only be able to mobilize 5 army groups to fight, while the Indian side can mobilize at least 10 armies in response.*** Due to restrictions on the throughput of Tibet’s airports, the number of soldiers that can be sent to Tibet is also relatively limited, and most of the air force still has to stay in the east to confront the United States and Japan. As the Strait of Malacca is controlled by other countries, the possibility of our navy crossing the Strait of Malacca and fighting the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean is currently unlikely. Therefore, theoretically speaking, China would have to use 40% of the army, less than half of the air force, and close to 0% of the navy in the Sino-Indian war against 70% of the Indian army, close to 100% of the navy and air force. Currently, I believe that if there is no external interference, China can defeat India with only half of its military power. however, In the most likely situation for war, although our military is far stronger than India, it does not occupy an absolute advantage.

***In short, in the context of a potential encounter, China has several major disadvantages against India:***

***1. China's main strategic focus is in the east, 70% of its military power will be used to confront the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and it will not be able to spare a hand to deal specifically with India.***

***2. Since 2016, the United States has gradually locked China as its number one competitor. If China starts a war against India, if it is a protracted war, the United States and the West will inevitably intervene. At that time, there may be wars in Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea. Creating a 2 fronts situation***

***3. 60% of China's oil imports pass through the Strait of Malacca, and a large amount of export trade also goes through this place. Once fighting against India begins, India or the US may take advantage by blockading the Strait of Malacca. China's crude oil reserves can only support 6-12 months during the war***

***4. The risks and pressures of the two- front warfare can be handled in a war against India. However, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is complex and the railway cannot support the logistics required for large-scale military operations.***

&#x200B;

 **Chapter 5: Regaining Taiwan is a prerequisite for resolving the Indian issue**

The importance of Taiwan is self-evident. First , Taiwan is a barrier to the southeastern coast. If Taiwan is controlled by an enemy country, the southeast coast of China, the most developed economic area, will become the frontline. Enemy aircraft can take off from Taiwan and bomb Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, etc. Secondly, Taiwan is a springboard for China's eastward exit into the Pacific. If Taiwan is recovered, the East China Sea Fleet can be stationed at Keelung Port. The US and Japan’s naval and air bases will easily become targets for our military, and the United States may shrink the line of defense from Ryukyu to Guam. Around. Therefore, for our country, the strategic value of Taiwan at the moment is far greater than that of Mongolia and southern Tibet.

At present, our military's technical means to regain Taiwan are mature. Our military far exceeds Taiwan's in terms of scale and equipment. The navy, air force, and rocket forces can suppress Taiwan in all directions. The biggest problem in regaining Taiwan lies in US interference. The United States' support to Taiwan can be described as unscrupulous. It not only sells equipment to Taiwan, but also allows the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to be undervalued, allowing Taiwan to enjoy a high trade surplus. This is a treatment that Japan and South Korea do not enjoy. Taiwan is a trump card for the United States to beat China, so the United States will not easily give up. 

***There is a view that the United States will not go to war with China for Taiwan. This view underestimates the determination of the United States to defend its world hegemony. With the rapid rise of China, the United States has already regarded China as its number one competitor.*** Taiwan being the core trump card for the United States to check and balance China. Once the mainland regains Taiwan, the United States will not only lose the Taiwan card, but will also produce a series of domino effects. Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia may fall to China because of the US inaction. By then, the US front in the Western Pacific will be at risk of collapse. In recent years, the United States has tried to suppress China's rise by various means including tariffs, technology, finance, and diplomacy, but they have not achieved the expected results. Therefore, the possibility that the United States may adopt military measures to suppress China in the future cannot be ruled out. The United States may not go to war with China for Taiwan itself, but the United States is likely to use Taiwan as an excuse to go to war with China. A similar example is that in 1914, in order to suppress the rise of Germany, the United Kingdom directly declared war on Germany under the pretext that Germany invaded Belgium and undermined neutrality. Before that, German domestic public opinion believed that Belgium was not worthy of the British war. This strategic misjudgment led to The outbreak of World War I. 

***After regaining Taiwan, China's geopolitical situation will be greatly improved.*** The first is the economic hinterland—the southeast coast- will gain an extra barrier. By then, the East China Sea Fleet can deploy to Taiwan and extend the maritime defense zone by 500 kilometers. The land defense situation will also be improved. First of all, the Eastern Theater will no longer need to maintain the size of the three army groups. The 73rd army stationed in Fujian can be transferred to the western theater to fight against India.",geopolitics,Wuhan

The signing of the Phase One trade deal and the future of China-US relations continued to be at the forefront of China’s national attention, and if a major domestic controversy existed, it was over how two women were able to drive a luxury SUV into the Forbidden Palace to snap pictures for social media. Discussions in homes and offices primarily revolved around that and each person’s plans for Spring Festival. The Year of the Rat was approaching – and as the first animal in the Chinese zodiac, it represents a new cycle and a new beginning.


Things have changed since then.

As of Sunday, January 26, there have been 56 fatalities directly attributable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak^1. The number of confirmed cases worldwide stands at 2,054, but the numbers from the National Health Commission are unlikely to be indicative of the true value – due to either practical circumstances or ‘political considerations’. 

As such, it is difficult to precisely assess and confirm the scale of the outbreak from a global perspective, but there are growing signs that this is now a fully-fledged domestic crisis – a calamity that is pushing the capabilities of the Party and state. 

**If the situation continues to escalate, it is highly probable that China’s economic development will witness pronounced effects.**

The clearest gaugeable consequence will be the severe damage caused to first quarter economic growth, in turn dramatically muddling the hopes of 2020 acting as a period of recovery. China’s increasingly consumption-based economy^2 is tremendously dependent on Chinese New Year for meeting targets and expectations^3, and for many industries, the outbreak brings unwelcome pain after an already tumultuous year. 

The film industry, as an example, saw uncertainty swell up in 2019, and as such, 2020’s spring releases were not just a chance to reap greater revenue – they were critical to the continuation of any forward momentum^4. Many premieres have been postponed or cancelled, and nearly every theater has been shut down^5. Even if they were not, it would have been unlikely for them to receive any sizeable audience.

This is a story that many businesses and industries will face, in turn inflicting larger shockwaves at a critical juncture where the economy is seeking to transform into a services and consumption-based model of growth^6. While this transformation can be expected to continue and fully mature, economic lethargy in 2020 will slow this process down. In some respects, this also applies to other macroeconomic trends. 

China’s long-term growth should largely remain the same, but if 2020 truly proves to be weaker amidst a dismal start, certain projections and benchmarks could be pushed back by at least a year. A whole array of preexisting calculations would then have to be adjusted, none of which would be beneficial for the Party.

Even in the ongoing whirlwind of outbreak response efforts, the central leadership must know that longer-term ramifications – far-reaching in breadth and severity – will have to be taken into account. On top of preexisting external pressures, it is becoming clear that guiding the country through this new zodiac cycle will be even more difficult than expected.

How are the big superpowers going to react tho this massive chaos?

&#x200B;

***What's happening***

The healthcare system in northern Italy is already clogged and beginning to collapse, not because of its quality (one of the best in the world) but because its budget was cut in the last 20 years, resulting in undersized hospitals. They are very competent, but it doens't matter if there are not enough beds. Germany has 3 times more intensive care units, for example.

This is the main reason of very different policies put in place by different countries. Italy was forced to stop the whole nation to avoid as much as possible a global healthcare collapse, exactly like China did.

Germany and UK decided not to stop the country, because they are doing the math, using Italian statistics, and they probably think they will be ""fine"". It's a big risk, but loosing their economy is a big risk too.

The U.S. are reacting very poorly, for now. This also adds up to the economic crisis. Trump is loosing (even more) his face, but he is now forced to take strong measures.

Let's go back to Italy, the country in the EU that got affected first: we know that Italy is taking a huge economical hit because its politicians didn't invest enough in healthcare budgets, they instead cut those budgets for decades. And if Italy goes down, the whole E.U. goes down. BCE knows this but Lagarde (president of BCE), instead of reassuring the economy, came out with a criminal statement, resulting in a market disaster. BCE is now carefully backtracking on her statement, but damage is done, and EU integrity is undermined.

As we can see the economy is already in the trash bin. Considering that the infection rate is identical everywhere (most of other countries are 8-9 days late compared to Italy), we can only expect the economy to go even further down, as soon as everyone is in Italy's shoes.

&#x200B;

***Some speculations***

If you think globally, the oil crisis is adding up to the virus crisis. What are the chances that the following things are happening at the same time just by coincidence?

\- U.S. doing an oversized exercitation along the Russian border (unprecedented).

\- NATO demanding an upgrade of Europe's infrastucture for military transit (drastic and unprecedented).

\- Putin and the OPEC drama, resulting in an actual oil price war.

\- Epicenter of the pandemic virus being in Wuhan, location of an institution of virology that studies military biological weapons.

\- Virus outbreak happening just when the Chinese New Year is about to start, exactly when hundreds of millions of people travel in and out of China every year.

\- Nuclear arms race reaching an unprecedented level (this slow process goes back since 2001).

\- The ""new Silk Road"" agreements, that would enpower Eurasia economy over the U.S. (unprecedented amount of money involved).

&#x200B;

***Conclusions***

We are witnessing history. The entire world's geopolitics are in motion to rewrite its primary powers, with China climbing at an insane rate (GDP, nuclear, new silk road, 5g, ecc...), and Russia acting and reacting strongly for its own interests (new missile system, internet independence, oil wars, ecc...).

All this will undermine the U.S. leadership and empower the Eurasian continent. How will the U.S. react, knowing its foreign policies of supremacy are under attack? Is this the meaning of the NATO agreements and of Europe Defender 20?

My hope is that this pandemic will have a role of de-escalation of some sorts, because if just one big country collapses, the whole world is potentially in danger. For sure the timing of this pandemic is absolutely crazy. Even without being paranoid, one can't avoid to raise serious questions that need answers.

&#x200B;

***My questions to you, fellow redditors:***

\- Do you agree to this analysis?

\- Is this reality or just semi-paranoid speculation?

\- How threatened do you feel right now by the geopolitic tensions?
