0,This sub has morphed into a pro Trump circlejerk and I'm sick of it,14094.0,i4cx29,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/i4cx29/this_sub_has_morphed_into_a_pro_trump_circlejerk/,3528.0,1596658535.0,"I've been using this sub on and off for years. Initially, I found it to be a community of rational individuals who wanted to question the status quo. During the height of the Epstein case last year it was pleasing to see users accept that NONE of our politicians are innocent and essentially on the same team. 

However, I've noticed over the summer that posts on r/conspiracy have become overwhelmingly right leaning. Half the time there's no real conspiracy being discussed! As I'm typing this, this sub has become nothing more than a right wing political page.  

What;s even worse is that I've noticed a flood of pro QAnon posts. For years Qanon has been ridiculed by serious conspiracy theorists based on how wrong it has been about virtually every event. The fact that anyone would believe that Trump, a man who's been a billionaire since his birth, is somehow attempting to expose the corruption of the elite is mind boggling to me.

My advice to any like minded individuals would be to leave this sub ASAP. I fully believe things will only get worse from here.",conspiracy,QAnon

2,Why is this sub not full of Ft. Hood/Ft. Bragg conspiracy theories every day? Y'all are arguing over Dr Seuss and QAnon and Covid while there's VERY CLEARLY something enormous going on with the military.,6938.0,ly8jeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ly8jeg/why_is_this_sub_not_full_of_ft_hoodft_bragg/,840.0,1614937724.0,"Even wilder, when I do find threads about stuff like the Ft. Hood deaths, [the comments are hand-waving them as just a natural consequence of how fucked up the military makes people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/kqmmgc/two_female_army_soldiers_found_dead_new_years_eve/)

Like right off the bat there's clearly something happening with Special Forces soldiers at Ft. Bragg. 

You've got the 2018 killing of 19th Special Forces Group soldier Mark Leshikar by his best friend and Delta Force operator William Lavigne. Five months later Daniel Gould of the 7th Special Forces Group and Henry Royer from the 19th, same as Leshikar, were busted smuggling 40 kilos of cocaine. December 2020, Lavigne is killed on Ft Bragg along with another, Timothy Dumas of the 7th Special Forces Group, same as Daniel Gould. Back to Lavigne, though, he was known to have participated with a nearby civilian skydiving and parachute club, Paraclete XP, based out of the Raeford Municipal Airport. That airport in 1984 was the location of a $2.2 billion cocaine bust. Among the involved was a Green Beret and skydiving enthusiast from Ft. Bragg, Paul Thacker, who was eventually acquitted despite testimony that he facilitated the Medellin cartel. Thacker would later purchase Raeford Municipal Airport in 1999. In June 2018, three months after Leshikar is killed by Lavigne, one TIM Thacker is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine using... yup, Raeford Municipal Airport. And that's not even mentioning the severed head of Ft. Bragg paratrooper Enrique Roman-Martinez that was found washed ashore in May 2020.

That's just Ft. Bragg. There was what, 30 something deaths at Ft. Hood last year ranging from dismemberment to lynching to suicide?

I have browsed this sub for a long time, but admittedly got caught up in the circus (mass psychosis) of the last couple years of political, social, civil, public health, and economic chaos. I have always had an intuitive feeling that Biden was ushered in as President by the powers that be, but went along with it because I felt that Trump was also chosen by the elite. Trump played a very important role, and now it was Biden’s turn (whether Trump was ready to go or not).

I thought, hell, might as well go along with it. Frankly, Biden’s promise of playing nice and ending COVID sounded comforting. What could he possibly do that would be so terrible? He would just remain a boring, white bread, moderately left President and not accomplish nor destroy anything significant.

Well, after yesterday’s press conference, my eyes have been completely opened. **Biden is here to oversee the fall of America as we know it.** He is here to oversee the great reset, the great awakening, whatever you want to call it. Dark times are ahead, and the powers that be have installed a puppet to mislead us, following the installation of a clown to distract us from 2016-2020.

I strongly believe that the next coming years will see great global economic, diplomatic, and societal fallout.

This includes: the worst economic crash of all time, stock market manipulation exposed, the inevitable rug pull of COVID, the public realizing that the last 2 years of their lives have been stolen from them for financial/political gain, Russia and China disturbing global sovereignty, Metaverses, cryptocurrency, and possibly much more. The economic crash will be so severe that it will be used to convince people that a great reset is NEEDED, just like 2 years of quarantines, masks, and vax were needed to stop the pandemic.

I also believe that we will continue to see the rapid cognitive decline of President Biden. I mean, I voted for the man, but yesterday’s press conference was *the single most embarrassing event I’ve ever witnessed* from the White House press floor. He was confused, delusional, misleading, out of touch, and by the end of it, there were numerous times where he was literally incoherent, unable to remember what he was saying as he was saying it.

This may or may not lead to the invocation of the 25th amendment. I’m not sure if TPTB will milk a full 4 years out of Biden or not, given Kamala’s inability to do apparently anything correct. The MSM is already turning on them both, so I’m not sure what this suggests for the impending chaos awaiting us in the next 3 years.

I have never experienced such a 180 degree revelation of my own cognitive dissonance and misinformed biases before. I feel shame, embarrassment, and anger for being conned into voting for these people. I truly believe that Biden & Harris are in place to oversee the darkest times in American history, and to divide this country further than it already is - in a completely different method than Trump’s rhetoric did.

My eyes are now open. I am now looking back at the 2020 election, the exploitation of the pandemic leading up to it, the media circus of narratives (COVID death tolls, Antifa, BLM, Proud Boys, George Floyd, Kyle Rittenhouse, presidential debates, election fraud, Jan 6th) and I see everything in a whole new perspective now. Even popular online conspiracy theory discourse all seem like orchestrated misinformation campaigns to me: Epstein, flight logs, Maxwell, Trump & Epstein, Biden sniffing kids, QAnon, Clintons, Plandemic, Bill Gates.

It's all fucking manipulated chaos and hysteria. We are living in an orchestrated sociopolitical theater, a clown circus, an amalgam of constant psyops and new world agendas. 

Why? I have absolutely no answer nor explanation. But I am seeing things that I have never seen before and I hoped to confide in this sub to share my truths.

I immediately signed up for every alternative social media service that promised not to censor free speech...

Now, 9 months later, I'm terrified of how this has become a normal part of life. All my favorite podcasters have to pick their words very carefully or be banned from YouTube, much of Reddit is no longer available to me (not a big loss there honestly) and everyone just seems to accept it as a normal part of life.

Less than a year and censorship has become the norm in America; the land of the free and home of the first amendment.

At the expense of bloodshed, they can manipulate the psychology and opinions of everyone on the globe. The media is force feeding pro-Ukraine pro-NWO propaganda down people’s throats. They’re so blinded by initial, irrational emotional reactions from seeing shellings and death, that they can’t foresee the actual implications of this unification under a globalist scale.

All wars are about money and power. Transactions are being made every second and people are getting rich as we speak, donations to Ukraine will be used to proliferate war crimes, and to line the pockets of the elite. Countries that aren’t a part of NATO will be incentivized to join through fear from the staged war. Once they do they will be taxed into oblivion, and once again that money will be used to fuel this agenda and to line the pockets of the elite. Sanctions will be used as a guise to hike prices, again so the rich can profit.

Once the good guys save us all from the bad guys, they will require more trust from us. They will require more control. A one world government will be instated, as well as a one world bank. Your actions will be monitored through social credit systems, to make sure you aren’t a bad guy, so that they can keep protecting you. This is all a theatre, and before our eyes we see people blindly choosing sides, and believing everything that they see or hear.

People are very sensitive to shock value, and it makes them herd into the desired direction that the propaganda tells them to head towards. In this case, this staged war and propaganda is leading us to the full-on acceptance of the NWO, and brainwashed individuals will stand by it tooth and nail that it is a welcomed control.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

EDIT: (please read to avoid misunderstandings)

1.) When I say staged I don’t mean faked, there is a distinction to be made here. Obviously there are people dying, and the fighting is real. What I meant is that the conditions for the war were set up intentionally by all parties involved. It is mostly out of the civilians control. 

2.) I am not right-wing nor am I attempting to spread Qanon, this is not related. I am not a Russian apologist or shill. I condemn the war in every manner. I simply believe it was set up by elites and has a much deeper agenda, rather than it simply being because Putin wants oil or land buffers.

3.) I am not attempting to move goalposts or make specific timeline predictions. The great reset began in 2020, and I suggest looking up the great reset agenda on the world economic forums website, as it confirms some of my stances. I believe the great reset is not a singular event but a transition into a NWO state through *several* events. 

4.) This is a conspiracy theory, I don’t claim any of this as fact. I am not an advisor, nor do I claim to have any solutions, this is merely a theory/observation. This post is for speculation and to think of what is happening in different ways. I’m glad it sparked a few conversations. Thank you",conspiracy,QAnon

I don’t want the Covid vaccine because I don’t have any fear of the virus given my age demographic and I don’t want to start taking vaccines for this virus that will inevitably end up with having to take more vaccines or boosters every single year once the vaccine wares off and/or every time a new variant comes out.  I’ve already had Covid, but even if I never got Covid I would rather just get the virus and be out for a couple weeks and reach a level of natural immunity instead of jabbing myself with a new vaccine of booster every 6 months in an attempt to run away from a virus that I would get anyway.  

I understand that having the vaccine lessens my chances of having to go to the hospital or die, but the chances of either of those two things happening to somebody that is 30 years old and fairly healthy is virtually zero.  So I wouldn’t be going to the hospital to “fill up all the beds” like a lot of people bring up.  

When it comes to me getting the virus and transmitting it to others, that is already happening with vaccinated people.  And they say that the only reason that is happening is because the unvaccinated are allowing the virus to mutate, making the old vaccines ineffective.  But what is stopping a virus from mutating within a vaccinated population?  Fauci already said that we are never getting rid of Covid as a virus, so why force people the vaccinate themselves every 6 months over a virus that is never going away?  If Covid is never going away, does that mean that if every person were to be vaccinated then Omicron would necessarily be that last variant?  That doesn’t make sense to me.  There will surely be several other variants.  

So if this virus is going to exist with us forever, I’m not seeing the reason why there is this insanely aggressive push to get everybody vaccinated.  Seems to me like the only externality that exists is the possibility of people filling up hospital beds.  But have you seen the amount of money that our government has to spend?  Use that money to ramp up the capacity of the hospitals instead of spending it on some stupid plan that you can slap a little inspiring slogan on that you can use in your next election campaign.  The reasons for forcing Covid vaccines on people is not convincing, therefore you have to come up with a plan to handle the results of that.  

The last thing is the dishonesty of the media and our pro-vax mandate politicians.  They act like people that don’t want the vax are just knuckle dragging idiots that think our “overlords” are trying to kill us or plant us with microchips.  If I took the vaccine, I wouldn’t plan on dying and I also wouldn’t think I had been planted with a microchip.  They act like we are incapable of making basic risk assessments.  My reasons for not getting the vax is as simple as, this virus is not going away, it will likely just act like another strain of the flu in the future, so I’m not starting this pattern of injecting myself with some different booster every 6 months to a year for the rest of my life over something we can’t prevent from existing and has no serious chance of hurting me.  But they can’t allow a reasonable opinion about not getting the vax to be spread.  You’re either pro vax, or you’re a Qanon, basement dwelling, tin foil hat wearing psycho that is responsible for all Covid deaths because of your “dangerous” opinions on the vax.  

It all seems to me to be more political than it is a genuine effort to respond to the virus.  They began calling it the “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.  That is such a disgusting thing to do.  They roll out these “vaccines” that basically just act as medicine to lessen symptoms of a virus that is never going away, and then they start calling people that don’t want it the ACTUAL virus.  “Pandemic of the unvaccinated” means that the people that don’t want the vax ARE the pandemic.  They ARE Covid.  Meaning that they’re directly responsible for the deaths of everybody that had died from Covid.  The levels that they will go to create hatred for one another for political gain is sick.",conspiracy,QAnon

The FBI for the first time has identified fringe conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat, according to a previously unpublicized document obtained by Yahoo News. (Read the document below.)

The FBI intelligence bulletin from the bureau’s Phoenix field office, dated May 30, 2019, describes “conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists,” as a growing threat, and notes that it is the first such report to do so. It lists a number of arrests, including some that haven’t been publicized, related to violent incidents motivated by fringe beliefs.

The document specifically mentions QAnon, a shadowy network that believes in a deep state conspiracy against President Trump, and Pizzagate, the theory that a pedophile ring including Clinton associates was being run out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant (which didn’t actually have a basement).

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document states. It also goes on to say the FBI believes conspiracy theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential election cycle.

The FBI said another factor driving the intensity of this threat is “the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups involving illegal, harmful, or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures.” The FBI does not specify which political leaders or which cover-ups it was referring to.

President Trump is mentioned by name briefly in the latest FBI document, which notes that the origins of QAnon is the conspiratorial belief that “Q,” allegedly a government official, “posts classified information online to reveal a covert effort, led by President Trump, to dismantle a conspiracy involving ‘deep state’ actors and global elites allegedly engaged in an international child sex trafficking ring.”

This recent intelligence bulletin comes as the FBI is facing pressure to explain who it considers an extremist, and how the government prosecutes domestic terrorists. In recent weeks the FBI director has addressed domestic terrorism multiple times but did not publicly mention this new conspiracy theorist threat.

The FBI is already under fire for its approach to domestic extremism. In a contentious hearing last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray faced criticism from Democrats who said the bureau was not focusing enough on white supremacist violence. “The term ‘white supremacist,’ ‘white nationalist’ is not included in your statement to the committee when you talk about threats to America,” Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said. “There is a reference to racism, which I think probably was meant to include that, but nothing more specific.”

Wray told lawmakers the FBI had done away with separate categories for black identity extremists and white supremacists, and said the bureau was instead now focusing on “racially motivated” violence. But he added, “I will say that a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.”

The FBI had faced mounting criticism for the term “black identity extremists,” after its use was revealed by Foreign Policy magazine in 2017. Critics pointed out that the term was an FBI invention based solely on race, since no group or even any specific individuals actually identify as black identity extremists.

In May, Michael C. McGarrity, the FBI’s assistant director of the counterterrorism division, told Congress the bureau now “classifies domestic terrorism threats into four main categories: racially motivated violent extremism, anti-government/anti-authority extremism, animal rights/environmental extremism, and abortion extremism,” a term the bureau uses to classify both pro-choice and anti-abortion extremists.

The new focus on conspiracy theorists appears to fall under the broader category of anti-government extremism. “This is the first FBI product examining the threat from conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists and provides a baseline for future intelligence products,” the document states.

The new category is different in that it focuses not on racial motivations, but on violence based specifically on beliefs that, in the words of the FBI document, “attempt to explain events or circumstances as the result of a group of actors working in secret to benefit themselves at the expense of others” and are “usually at odds with official or prevailing explanations of events.”

The FBI acknowledges conspiracy theory-driven violence is not new, but says it’s gotten worse with advances in technology combined with an increasingly partisan political landscape in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. “The advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access,” the document says.

The bulletin says it is intended to provide guidance and “inform discussions within law enforcement as they relate to potentially harmful conspiracy theories and domestic extremism.”

The FBI Phoenix field office referred Yahoo News to the bureau’s national press office, which provided a written statement.

“While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve,” the FBI said.

In its statement, the FBI also said it can “never initiate an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity. As with all of our investigations, the FBI can never monitor a website or a social media platform without probable cause.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which has also been involved in monitoring domestic extremism, did not return or acknowledge emails and phone requests for comment.

While not all conspiracy theories are deadly, those identified in the FBI’s 15-page report led to either attempted or successfully carried-out violent attacks. For example, the Pizzagate conspiracy led a 28-year-old man to invade a Washington, D.C., restaurant to rescue the children he believed were being kept there, and fire an assault-style weapon inside.

The FBI document also cites an unnamed California man who was arrested on Dec. 19, 2018, after being found with what appeared to be bomb-making materials in his car. The man allegedly was planning “blow up a satanic temple monument” in the Capitol rotunda in Springfield, Ill., to “make Americans aware of Pizzagate and the New World Order, who were dismantling society,” the document says.

Historian David Garrow, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Martin Luther King Jr. who has worked extensively with FBI archives, raised doubts to Yahoo News about the memo. He says the FBI’s default assumption is that violence is motivated by ideological beliefs rather than mental illness. “The guy who shot up the pizza place in D.C.: Do we think of him as a right-wing activist, or insane?” Garrow asked.

Garrow was similarly critical of the FBI’s use of the term “black identity extremists” and related attempts to ascribe incidents like the 2016 shooting of six police officers in Baton Rouge, La., to black radicalism. He said the shooter, Gavin Long, had a history of mental health problems. “The bureau’s presumption — the mindset — is to see ideological motives where most of the rest of us see individual nuttiness,” he said.

Identifying conspiracy theories as a threat could be a political lightning rod, since President Trump has been accused of promulgating some of them, with his frequent references to a deep state and his praise in 2015 for Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy site InfoWars. While the FBI intelligence bulletin does not mention Jones or InfoWars by name, it does mention some of the conspiracy theories frequently associated with the far-right radio host, in particular the concept of the New World Order.

Jones claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which 26 children were killed, was a hoax, a false flag operation intended as a pretext for the government to seize or outlaw firearms. The families of a number of victims have sued Jones for defamation, saying his conspiracy-mongering contributed to death threats and online abuse they have received.

While Trump has never endorsed Sandy Hook denialism, he was almost up until the 2016 election the most high-profile promoter of the birther conspiracy that claimed former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. He later dropped his claim, and deflected criticism by pointing the finger at Hillary Clinton. He said her campaign had given birth to the conspiracy, and Trump “finished it.”

There is no evidence that Clinton started the birther conspiracy.

28,The McAfee Dead Mans Switch has been located. Soon it will be decrpyted! Here is what to expect:,565.0,or70kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/or70kh/the_mcafee_dead_mans_switch_has_been_located_soon/,186.0,1627197180.0,"So it turns out Madman McAffe truly did upload insurance files to be released in the case of his death. 31 terabytes! Thats a lot of information. McAfee, who unsuccessfully tried to get the Libertarian Party nomination in the last two election cycles, worked as a programmer for the Apollo missions and, of course, started the McAfee antivirus software, leaving the company in the 90s.   

I expect this file dump to be decrypted in the next 72 hours.What kind of information could it have?

On his own blog McAfee stated:  
 

\> I purchased 75 cheap laptop computers and, with trusted help, installed invisible keystroke logging software on all of them—the kind that calls home (to me) and disgorges the text files. It also, on command, turns on, and off, the microphone and camera—and sends these files on command. I had the computers re-packaged as if new. I began giving these away as presents to select people—government employees, police officers, Cabinet Minister’s assistants, girlfriends of powerful men, boyfriends of powerful women. I hired four trusted people full time to monitor the text files and provide myself with the subsequent passwords for everyone’s e-mail, Facebook, private message boards, and other passworded accounts. The keystroke monitoring continued after password collection, in order to document text input that would later be deleted. So nothing was missed.

\> I next collected my human resources for the complex social engineering I would have to do. I arranged with 23 women and six men to be my operatives. Eight of the women were so accomplished that they ended up living with me. It was amazingly more efficient and they were easily convinced to check up on each other. One was so accomplished (Marcia) that she became a double agent and nearly got me killed.

So this is what we are about to get! The private information of a lot of powerful people. We do indeed live in interesting times :)

At a minimum, we are about to see that the elite are generally psychopaths and governments are completely corrupt, on a scale much greater than any previous information release. At maximum, we might get proof of elite child trafficking and pedophile rings.

Now, this information release is going to trigger some major events and shifts

I want to preface the following analysis with saying that politics and even deep politics are bullshit, it is the entertainment division of the shadow government and everything is staged.  

With that in mind, we can see that the psychopath parasites are planning to put some special spin. There is a McAfee account on telegram posting a lot of Qanon related content. This is a psyop. When the information is released, it will be censored on all major platforms and the official story is that it is just a Qanon conspiracy. To explain the information, they will say it was manufactured by Russia.  

Qanon was created in the first place to discredit the very real conspiracy of elite child trafficking among the sleeping populace, so they don’t look into it further.

I anticipate the information being damning enough that the psychopath parasites (PP s) will need to stage a false flag attack to dominate the news cycle. This time, I don’t anticipate it being blamed on middle eastern terrorists, but domestic terrorists. The alleged perpetrator will be described as a Qanon nut.  

This will be the pretext to initiate a new war on domestic terror. There goal is to put militarized police in the streets to take lockdowns to a new level. They will bring in a new era of censorship with the pretext that “misinformation”, aka information not approved by the state, leads to violence and must be eliminated at all costs.

They will also shift to heating up the cold war with Russia, both with rhetoric and operations. They hope to keep people afraid by giving them enemies on all fronts. Qanon, Russia, Covid. Qanon followers will be afraid of the new militarized police getting them. Either way the PPs benefit.

We must do our best to spread awareness of the psychopathic control system so their agenda doesn’t work.  

What are your thoughts? Mine is:

Buckle up!

Love vibes to all,

Before google, we seemed to have access to hundreds of thousands of tiny small weird websites. Now, when you google something, it's the same dozen website that comes up. More and more, I've realized I can't really access much information, aside from just coming across MSM outlets' take on them. Also, as I use VPNs a lot, the location-themed results are extremely annoying. Why should it matter where I am supposed to be, information should be the same everywhere.

Here are some things I've noticed, please add your own comments if you can think of anything. Maybe we can get an eventual list of what we don't have access to:

**1) Torrents, Warez, etc.** Finding a link to a torrent site is sometimes much harder than it may appear. Google piratebay and the actual site doesn't come up as the first link. Same for kickasstorrent. What if I just google ""torrent sites"", shouldn't the top ones come up? No.

**2) Non-western allied news sites:** Full disclosure, I'm from Iran, and it irritates me that if I search for Iran keywords, the results in the news section are ALL anti-Iran MSM. Israel news sites pop up at a far higher frequency on the keyword ""iran"" in [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/) than dozens of english domestic iranian news sites. Why? So does, western funded media such as BBC or Radio Farda (Iran focused news site funded by America). Major Iranian news site have purposely been removed, such as PressTV is blocked by Google from showing up on [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/). Generally, good luck finding even ONE result in [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/) that has an iranian media source ON IRAN SUBJECTS.

**3) Non-mainstream stuff:** I've never really been into QAnon and stuff, but was curious recently to see what the hell is this stuff the MSM keeps talking about. So I google QAnon. Wiki is first link (wikipedia is by the way a whole other problem), guardian, guardian, cbsnews, nytimes, rollingstones, bbc, dw, nbcnews. ALL MSM. This is page 1.

So let me try page 2, the graveyard of google searches.

New Yorker, theconversation, abcnews, indepandant.co.uk , washington post, washingtonpost, [congress.gov](https://congress.gov/), theintercept, financialtimes, wired. 2nd page ends. Notice, still no actual site where qanon stuff is posted and ALL OF IT IS NEWS SITES (aside from wiki and [congress.gov](https://congress.gov/)). I didn't go to [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/).

Page 3:

usatoday, apnews, wired, technologyrevew, theatlantic, [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) (some book on qanon), motherjones, fb\[dot\]com (how we are addressing..), youtube (QAnon: Are conspiracy theories becoming a deadly threat ...), [smh.com.au](https://smh.com.au/)

See, that's three pages.

In duckduckgo, sandwiched between CNN and NY Times, I finally find one or two sites that posts their stuff.

**4) Groups of the wrong kind:** What if I want to read on various extremists hated filled truly bad groups, as informed by the elites of the world? Like, I'm not American, but was curious to see who the hell these Proud Boys are. I generally like to read stuff from the group's own views, rather than rephrased by someone else. I'm not a child.

Page 1: Wiki, [splcenter.org](https://splcenter.org/), cnn, the guardian, forbes, cbsnews, cnet, [adl.org](https://adl.org/), bbc. End of page 1.

Notice the same gang of the same media. Once again, I didn't go to [news.google.com](https://news.google.com/). I don't really want BBC or Forbes or Gaurdian's take on it. Logically, I would expect THEIR OWN SITE OR PLATFORM TO BE THE FIRST RESULT, because that's the basic job of a search engine. If I tell you I'm looking for dog shit, then show me dog shit, I don't need you to tell me your opinion on why dog shit smells bad.

I searched 10 pages and couldn't find a link to their main page. Duckduckgo has it as the first result.

I've had the same problem in the past. I remember when ISIS was taking over large pieces of land in Syria, they would have an english magazine (weekly or monthly, can't remember). To me, that was a unique and interesting look into the minds of such a group that was cutting people's heads off on camera. But it was such a difficult task finding it.

Ever wonder just why so many Russian Oligarchs are so willing to provide Trump and other Republicans so much money?

And the cover provided by Republican's deliberately botched response to the Pandemic has worked amazingly well.

**Barr has ties to convicted child-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that goes back even farther than Trump's by at least a decade. His father, Donald Barr - while Headmaster at Dalton - hired Epstein in 1974 as a teacher notwithstanding his complete lack of qualifications. Barr also published a science fiction book where the dominant theme was teen sex slavery.**

**William Barr continued his association with Jeffrey Epstein and his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Barr, represented the child trafficker and pedophile.**

[Wake Up Call: Kirkland Lawyers Facing Glare in Epstein Sex Trafficking Case](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/wake-up-call-kirkland-lawyers-facing-glare-in-epstein-sex-trafficking-case)

Donald Barr was a pedophile. Epstein was a child trafficker and pedophile. Bill Barr is a pedophile. Trump is a pedophile and unrepentant rapist. They are all part of a large international network of child abusers and traffickers.

And Republican persistence in obstructing oversight of ICE has made it easy to disappear kids into the system - to be distributed to GOP pedophiles and their financial backers at home and abroad. Fish in a barrel. No records of the kids. Parents have no rights, no recourse, and no access to legal help in America.

The GOP is lousy with child rapists and sex abusers - all with unfettered access to kids in ICE custody.

[GOP Sex And Child-Sex Abuse List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPoppinKreamSays/comments/980slo/gop_sex_child_sex_abuse_list/)

This is a horror like the concentration camps in Nazi Germany - where most German citizens either did not know or refused to believe it was happening right under their noses. Thousands of kids have been deliberately 'lost'. Trump, Barr and ICE have been running the world's largest child-trafficking ring in history for the last four years.

Trump, Barr, and many other members of the GOP are implicated in child sex crimes by evidence provided by Maxwell. I'm looking for a headline any day now where she has contracted a 'mysterious illness'.

QAnon's recent firehose of virtue-signaling anti-CP propaganda on Facebook is an attempt to dilute the revelation of decades of trafficking of children to Trump and his associates - including his AG and personal fixer Bill Barr.

It isn't hard to put the pieces together. Its all widely documented and out in the open - like the smoke coming from the chimneys at Treblinka. And where there's smoke, there's fire. And in the case of the conspiracy by Republicans to traffic children taken at the border, its a raging inferno.

Again:

Attorney General William Barr's dad, Donald Barr, hired Epstein as a teacher in 1973 - even though Epstein had zero experience or qualifications.
Epstein engaged in unsavory conduct at Dalton - and it was noticed. For Donald Barr, this wasn't a bug - it was a feature.
Donald Barr wrote and published a book of teen-rape fan-fiction. that's hundreds of hours of sitting down in a chair, fantasizing about raping kids, writing it into a story, and publishing it.
The Barr family has had a relationship with Epstein for 47 years.
Current AG Bill Barr grew up with Epstein. Likely introduced him to Trump.
**Thousands of kids harvested at the border have been ""lost""**
**Thousands of kids in ICE custody have been raped by ICE personnel**
**Attorney General William Barr, and his father, were and are pedophiles who were supplied kids by Epstein for decades. More recently - children taken from parents by ICE and BORTAC at the border who have been 'disappeared' into the system are being trafficked to powerful people in America and abroad.**

And when a State Prosecutor in Florida, Alex Acosta, later Trump's Labor Secretary, let Epstein off scott-free after being convicted for child sex crimes.

And recently there was a hit on the family of a Federal Judge who was presiding over Epstein's case - and the gunman was also conveniently 'found dead'.

[Gunman Shoots Son, Husband of Federal Judge Esther Salas Presiding Over Epstein Case](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/judge-esther-salas-new-jersey-husband-son-shooting-1031146/) 

This goes far beyond Trump. At the top of our Federal Government is a ring of men who have been pedophiles and child-traffickers for decades - all connected by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell. They have been engaged in conspiracy to murder witnesses in custody and Federal judges involved with the case. They have continuously obstructed justice and any investigations into crimes committed by the Trump Administration.

They are pure evil.

It hit me yet again as I was reading a comment from someone claiming Tom Hanks is ""in on it."" In on what, I'm not sure; the post was about everything from CIA to Rothschild.

And from there the conversation went as it always does...

>""Tom Hanks is in on it? Is there any evidence?""  
*""He has said certain things that suggests so, yes.""*  
""What things?""  
*""He once made a reference to the day he got sick. Of course there's sooo much more to it.""*

*""Oh, he once played in a movie where another character called him Corona.""*  
""Oh...""  
*""Of course there's sooo much more to it, this is just the tip of the ice berg.""*

There's always ""more to it"" and it's always just ""the tip of the ice berg"" and yet no one's ever willing to actually show, link or even explain. All of a sudden, burden of proof is forgotten completely. It's not their job to back up their claims, or prove their theories. It's *your* job to disprove it. [And just like with Russel's teapot, you often can't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)

I have scoured the pizzagate posts, the Cabal videos on youtube, the Rothschild posts and all the little theories in between, looking for *anything* that isn't circumstantial, or at least something that's based on truth. And every single time, there is the same message: *There is more to it. This is just the tip of the ice berg. Do your own research if you don't believe me.*

So I did. And not a single claim held up.

Oh, and everyone's a Rothschild now -- all you need is vaguely similar facial features or any association with antlers.

So it made me wonder: these people keep saying it's so painful to know the truth, that it's such a burden to have ""woken up""... But if it's such a burden, why are they willing to just accept it all, even without evidence?

>*“Waking up” is almost unbearable.*  
*My perception of reality has been shattered.*  
*We are enslaved in a man-made prison.*

Usually when you tell people something that upsets them, they're not willing to accept it without proof. But when someone claims that the Rothschild family or Rockefellers own the federal reserve -- a highly unlikely and deeply upsetting claim -- no one's demanding evidence. These theories are more fragile than a house of cards, and yet no one wants to poke at it.

In the Reddit conspiracy culture, there is the idea that blindly trusting the government and the media is naive. And I agree, it is. But then why are you willing to blindly trust these wild allegations? Doesn't it scare you how easily someone in power could manipulate you? For example by making you believe that Hillary and most of the left is part of a pedophile ring and that Hitler was correct in that wealthy Jewish families are evil...

So many people are complaining about how painful it is to ""wake up"" and that the world seems so dark now, but I honestly think it's an act. I think it makes them feel powerful, in control. I think the reason they avoid doing legit research is because they might just find out the world is much more normal than they thought, that Hillary doesn't torture and kill children to drink their blood and that Trump isn't speaking to them in code. And maybe that's worse. It's empowering to imagine that even the 1% can't hide from you. It's much scarier to admit that either a) The world is much more normal -- and boring -- than they thought, or b) It is as scary and dark as they assume, but the real secrets are not so easily uncovered. Because in this reality, they are not part of an unstoppable movement, they have not ""woken up"" and the secrets of the world remain secret.

>After the arrest of Raniere in March (which fits our timeline), certain celebs got spooked and wanted to start talking to try to get ahead of this thing – because Harvey wasn’t planning on talking then, himself (he still had AG Schneiderman in power as his protection). Sure, it’s probable that Bourdain did some horrible things – but if you can make your deeds pale in comparison to someone really evil, you might still make it out alive.

>Unless that really evil person catches wind of what you’re trying to do, and pulls a few strings, calls in a few last favors.

>Yeah, to me, this is looking more and more like Harvey (or someone above him) has ordered some kind of hit squad.

THE. DAMN. TIME** within this fucked-up company of theirs. And this is but the *beginning* of what is *(quite so rapidly)* about to tumble out from underneath *that* can of worms; and very, *VERY SHORTLY* at *that.* For there's many, MANY more than just that *one disgruntled employee,* who are in ***MASSIVE*** **DISAGREEMENT** with many of their *paedo-friendly* *""policies""* in here, let's just say. And the good news is, that you are soon going to see one (or even more, can't give away *too many details* at *this point in time* here ;) ) of the ***ADMIN*** variety start speaking up **SUPER. FUCKING.** ***OPENLY.*** about this stuff very, very, *shortly* in here. Don't ask me how *I* know this --- or what's even really been *""prompting""* these ones (admins) to be really doing this. Instead, let's just say that the ***""evidence""*** for my claims will be available *SOONER THAN WHAT YOU'D EXPECTED* here. And I'll leave it at *that.* Believe me, disbelieve me. I could care lesser.  

But even *other than* what is ALL about to be brought out here in the open *super-fucking-shortly,* there are several other *key reasons* as to why the Reddit Top Management is *seriously wary* of even as much as *considering* bringing down the proverbial *""ban hammer""* upon this community. And here's *why.*  

---  

**THREAT #1:** *4chan* has openly threatened ***UNPRECEDENTED*** retaliation if Reddit decides to take it's paedo-friendly agendas to the next level by banning this sub. And no matter how many *Redditors* mock them through the *""hacker 4chan"" meme* on here all day long, everyone, literally *every single person* who's aware of what they can ***really do*** -- **KNOWS** that they aren't really a force to be *fucked around with.* And trust me on this, the *Reddit Management* ***most certainly*** knows the level of infiltration and *attack* that they'd be needing to deal with on a ***LITERAL 24x7 BASIS*** here, were 4chan, of all groups, to declare an ALL OUT ***WAR*** against this [***rather*** **paedo-friendly**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hoq2xx/so_why_is_it_that_a_gif_of_donald_trump_and/) website of theirs. Besides, it's not even the ONLY *""chan""* out there that's quite ***anti-paedo*** [***right now.***](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hos8eb/this_should_be_on_the_front_page_of_reddit_just/) And let's just leave it all there at *that.*  

**THREAT #2:** Many, MANY **KEY** influencers within the *Qanon community* are very, VERY active on in here. And their numbers, too, are far, FAR greater than what you'd believe. And unlike 4chan (which, though extremely *dangerous,* is a relatively *small* group of people amongst the vast internet); the Qanon community has MASSIVE user and follower bases, BOTH on TWITTER as well as YOUTUBE. And hell, even FACEBOOK. And given that so, SO MANY of these influencers (and *non-influencers* alike) are now ***ACTIVELY*** keeping an eye on this community (and the *on-goings* within it), going to war against them is, well, outright *foolish,* more than anything else. Plain and simple :)  

**THREAT #3:** If even all of *THAT* wasn't enough, let me introduce you to ***YET ANOTHER*** category of people who lurk (and on rare occassions, post) upon *this very subreddit* of ours. Yes. I'm talking about key Twitter influencers. YouTube influencers. Facebook influencers. And believe it or not, even Instagram and *TikTok influencers* (of all things) no less. These folks aren't necessarily even *aligned* with any ideology or community (many of these ones are, in fact, active *outside of the* US here); but their sheer Social Media presence and reach is *FUCK-ING FORMIDABLE.* Not sure even *Reddit Top Management* have the sheer guts to take down *these ones* ***AS WELL*** in here.  

**THREAT #4:** Now, *IF ONLY* the *above list* was *enough!* Instead, let me tell you all about a **FOURTH,** ***incredibly*** *formidable* force, that is currently at ***MASSIVE*** odds with Reddit. Yes. I'm talking about the folks over at *the_donald,* folks. And you'd be extremely *naïve* to think that they've all gone off Reddit (and off ***r/Conspiracy*** here, of all places). Not sure Reddit is even really *prepared* to handle ***their lot*** attacking Reddit ***EN MASSE*** here either no less. (Why do you think they gave *t_d* such a *sloooooow death* in here? Even giving them ***ALL OF THE TIME IN OUR WORLD*** to escape to their *new* hangout? Yeah. *Exactly.*)  

**THREAT #5:** Wait WHAT???! There's even a FIVE here?! Well, I'm *afraid so.* Guys, this is nearly a 1.3 MILLION+ strong community. Read that one again. A **1.3 MILLION+ PEOPLE** ***STRONG*** **COMMUNITY.** *Even if* a *0.3 MILLION* of *those people* were *""shills""* and *""bots""* (and that's a SUPER-MASSIVE reach and stretch here; given the sheer *kind of* money and resources required to maintain SO MANY of those); there's still, I repeat, *STILL* a ***1-MILLION-STRONG-ARMY*** of some ***extremely pissed off*** *paedo-haters*, local community influencers, and so many other people from *ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE* --- who would be ***ALL TOO GLAD*** to thoroughly expose and bring down this *Paedo-friendly website* by *any and ALL means* necessary in here, if *their lot* were to be provoked.  

---  

*In summation,* and you all can consider this one a **TL;DR** in here: Other than CONFIRMED impending Power Mod, Mod, and Admin Rebellions which are about to shake down this site to it's *very* ***FOUNDATIONS*** (and I'm using *THOSE SPECIFIC WORDS* for a reason here ;) ) soon enough; If ***spez*** and his gang even as much as ***ATTEMPT*** banning this community; or attempt to give it the *""slow and painful death / takeover""* that they gave to *t_d* (which of course, won't work here *AT ALL* because we'd ***ALL*** be able to see through that shit *RIGHT AWAY;* which, by the way, also just happens to be the *VERY* ***REASON*** that this community is still alive and working even *TODAY*) -- the *top management of Reddit* will STILL have a *few more obstacles than* ***that*** in their paths, that they'll have to very, *very shortly and rapidly* ***deal with*** *thereafter.* And which is a force that is ***SO. INCREDIBLY. MASSIVE.*** that it would absolutely be ***WAY BEYOND THEM*** to even as much as be able to ***COMPREHEND IT,*** --- let alone be able to **STOP IT.** ***ANY. DAMN. HOW.***  

And *that's* because other than the Mods, Power Mods, and some key Reddit ADMINS *themselves* ready to let the k̶i̶d̶s̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶u̶p̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶s̶  *cat out of the bag* in here, **r/Conspiracy** is now being **actively watched** and ***PROTECTED*** by the *Qanons,* the *4channers* (and other prominent ""chan"" sites), the *Trump Army,* the *Republicans,* the *Conservatives* (from all across the globe); and most importantly, the *COUNTLESS INFLUENCERS* on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and even those on *Tik. Fucking. Tok* no less (how else do you think *SO VERY MANY* of the key conspiracies on *this sub* are making it *in there?)*  

Last, but by *NO MEANS* the very *least,* ***this very sub itself*** has ***1.3 MILLION+ users*** (that too, those that have legit *SUBSCRIBED* to this sub). And that there's a far, *FAR GREATER NUMBER* that comprises of lurkers, non-subscribers, and the *like.* How many of ***THESE ONES*** can they even really as much as ***ATTEMPT TO*** *stop* in here?  

---  

**SUPER-TL;DR:** Banning this sub is a **SUPER. FUCKING.** ***BAD.*** **IDEA!** And the *entirety* of Reddit's paedo top management is ***VERY FULLY AWARE*** of ***THAT.*** So it's not gonna happen. And if it does, then *by God* is the aftermath going to be *super-fucking-hilarious* here lmao. And to remind people *(very, very,* ***clearly!)*** as to just how very ***SUPPORTED*** we all are here in this battle of ours against the Paedophiles, the Cannibals and the *Satanists* -- and that too -- from some of the most *UNEXPECTED* quarters of peoples and groups from all around the globe. Which ***includes*** some, shall I say, very *high* places no less ;) Cheers.

I see the political climate as just two different religions arguing with each other mostly over dumb cultural issues, while claiming to be about ""freedom"", despite wanting unnecessary regulations and restrictions (yes, that includes you too republicans). It honestly feels staged to me. Even the Qanon phenomenon almost feels like a device that the Trump and Biden administration invented just to further divide us. Why is Fox News being promoted by big tech if Hollywood truly is an anti-conservative system? Why is the media obsessed with us fighting over identity politics (both the left and right)? Why are you allowed to complain about liberal ideology on mainstream social media platforms, and promote republican (not alt-right, but republican) ideology if Hollywood and big tech truly are pro-censorship and super leftist? Why is it always the same predictable arguments? Conservatives call anything gay ""woke"", leftists get mad at satirical irony from the past. Conservatives want to keep guns, liberals want to regulate them. conservatives hate abortion, liberals want abortion. Conservatives want a wall, liberals don't, etc. 

You see the same stupid reactionary thumbnails and headlines everywhere. ""Ben Shapiro humiliates so and so"", ""Dear white people/privilege"". All of the same Bernie car bumpers and Let's Go Brandon shirts. This divide creates stories, and those stories make money.

Guys,
they are all part of it. They are controlling us and intentionally dividing us. It isn't just ""left vs right"".


Edit: I wish I wasn't the only person who feels this way. I wish there were more libertarians. 

Not ""socialist libertarians"" who want restrictions over our freedoms and higher taxes. Not conservative cosplayers who claim to be libertarians but then yell ""build the wall, no abortions, trans people bad""..

>the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.

>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.

>Read the full memo, obtained by NPR from a Democratic source:

>""This Memorandum is intended to memorialize our agreement regarding the creation and operation of Hillary Victory Fund (Victory Fund), a joint fundraising committee of Hillary for America (HFA) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

>""HFA is prepared to raise and invest funds into the DNC via the Victory. In return for this financial support, HFA requires the appropriate influence over the financial, strategic, and operational use of these JFA-raised funds.

>""Commencing on September 1, 2015 HFA agrees to raise funds for the Victory Fund sufficient to fund the DNC's data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations. Specifically, HFA will agree to raise and to instruct the Victory Fund Treasurer, Beth Jones (who is employed by HFA) to transfer from the Victory Fund a minimum of one million and two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000.00) to the DNC from its share of the net proceeds under the allocation formula on the first day of every month (beginning October 1, 2015) for these activities (the ""Base Amount""). In the event that the Victory Fund is not in possession of adequate net proceeds allocable to the DNC on the first of the month to make such transfer, it shall make the required transfer as soon as adequate funds are available.

>""HFA's obligations under this agreement, and the release of the Base Amounts each month are conditioned on the following:

>With respect to the hiring of a DNC Communications Director, the DNC agrees that no later than September 11, 2015 it will hire one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA.

>With respect to the hiring of future DNC senior staff in the communications, technology, and research departments, in the case of vacancy, the DNC will maintain the authority to make the final decision as between candidates acceptable to HFA.

>Agreement by the DNC that HFA personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research. The DNC will provide HFA advance opportunity to review on-line or mass email, communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate. This does not include any communications related to primary debates – which will be exclusively controlled by the DNC. The DNC will alert HFA in advance of mailing any direct mail communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate or his or her signature.

>If asked by a State Party, the DNC will encourage the State Party to become a participant in the Victory Fund.

>""Once HFA has raised the first $1,200,000 and it has been distributed to the DNC, HFA will be granted complete and seamless access to all research work product and tools (not including any research or tracking the DNC may engage in relating to other Democratic candidates).

>""The parties also agree that they will enter into an agreed upon voter file licensing agreement. As consideration for that agreement, HFA will raise an additional $250,000 into the Victory Fund that will be distributed to the DNC no later than March 31, 2016.

>""In addition, HFA will also raise funds for the Victory Fund that will distributed to the DNC in excess of the $1,200,000 monthly base amount (Excess Amount). The Excess Amount raised by HFA that is distributed to the DNC will be spent on the DNC's data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations as directed by HFA (Special Projects). Although the DNC will remain responsible for the day to day execution of those Special Projects, HFA will determine (in consultation with the DNC) the Special Project's scope, strategy, staffing, budget, and manner of execution.

>""Finally, HFA agrees that on a monthly basis the Victory Fund will provide the DNC a list of receipts and disbursements from the Victory Fund. The DNC agrees to provide monthly financial reports to HFA as it relates to the use of the funds distributed by the Victory Fund to the DNC.

>""In the event that there is a disagreement in the operation of this agreement or the use of the Base Amount, the DNC department head and their HFA counterpart will meet and confer to resolve the matter. If that fails to resolve the disagreement, then you and I will resolve it. If there is still no resolution the DNC Chair and the HFA Chair will resolve.

>""Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process. All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary. Further we understand you may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.

>""The attached Joint Fundraising Agreement will be entered into by HFA and the DNC (as well as by State Parties).

>""This agreement will be reviewed on March 31, 2016 and either party may terminate any prospective obligation at that time.

>""If this memorandum correctly summarizes our agreement, please reply by email with the text – 'Agreed by DNC'.""

59,Pizzagate wasn't always this anti-democratic partisan bias with Qanon at the helm. It was apprehended. It all started from John Podesta's leaked emails. Here's some of the best OG circumstantial evidence from the roots.,233.0,hmx0zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hmx0zc/pizzagate_wasnt_always_this_antidemocratic/,52.0,1594136882.0,"First off, too many of you didn't follow the scandal as it was developing/breaking(which is fine), so you have a very skewed and propagandized version of what happened. 

Journalist Ben Swann did a 5 minute news segment that covered the basics of what happened. No accusations, no conjecture, just an analysis of what the online researchers had compiled. 

So, start off by watching this. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpMg6UOMvEg

It's also important to note that Ben's social media went ""dark"" after this and he (although not fired technically), no longer did any ""Reality Check"" segments with CBS *immediately* after this, and no longer posted on social media.

https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/ben-swann-truth-media-site-down-twitter-instagram-accounts-gone/9uqPLr432aX9JVKkNXP5FM/

With that summary in mind, now you at least aren't running around like a chicken with your head cut off, wondering where this all emanated from, who the characters are, etc. Many people cite ""Q"" as an influence for their PG research. It's VERY important to note that Qanon came *after* PG initially broke in 2016. Q, widely believed to be a pacification psyop by many, is merely riding the coattails of the PG investigation, and further injecting a partisan right bias within the scandal, which is unfair and inaccurate, and preventing us from reaching a larger audience. Remember, no partisan bias. This kind of deviant behavior transcends these phony partisan lines. 

Here is a comprehensive summary of all the evidence. **Its very important that you read through this, or else you'll just walk away with the watered down and propagandized version of whatever your friends or online buddies are parroting about PG.**

https://steemit.com/ghaitofpizza/@mandireiserra/voat-backup-fully-sourced-executive-summary-of-pizzagate-evidence-by-millennialfalcon

Remember, it all starts with the Podesta emails. 

So theres the basics, but theres one more piece of evidence I find to be particularly incriminating and not based on conjecture or mere theory. James Alefantis, the guy who owns the restaurant that Podesta was linked to via a fundraiser held there, actually contacted and **threatened to murder an online researcher who posted on Voat.**

Here is the video of what he discovered. He essentially discovered a property owned by Alefantis known as the ""Pegasus Museum""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IqDdtW0MBg

>“This connection also demonstrates that Alefantis is not just a simple ‘pizza shop owner’ as he has claimed in the mainstream media on at least one occasion. Moreover, it is also important to point out that the definition of “castellum,” according to Wikipedia, is: “A castellum in ancient Latin is usually either: a small Roman fortlet or tower, a diminutive of castrum, often used as a watchtower or signal station e.g. on Hadrian’s Wall,” which is an interesting caveat with a cherry on top, if I may add.

>The building itself and the property in which the Pegasus Museum is situated on are located in the “Columbia Heights” neighborhood. Assessed at a value $325,560, the museum is owned by Castellum Achilles LLC.

>According to public records, the museum has previously had building permits issued for construction which seem to match up closely to a timeframe semi-consistent with photos that Alefantis himself posted on Instagram that show open trenches in what is believed by O’Neal to be the “Pegasus kill room.”

>Strangely, it has also been discovered that within a close proximity of the Pegasus Museum several ominous markings, graffiti taggings, can be found. One of the tags, spray painted on a concrete wall, clearly says “kids” and has an arrow pointing downward,”Shepard Ambellas, wrote.

Here is a video of Ryan explaining what happened to him that night.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM 

And here is a detailed article on what happened. 

https://wearechange.org/james-alefantis-threatens-pizzagate-researcher-ryan-oneal/


So theres the fundamentals and some of the juicier stuff. This is merely one example of the kind of stuff that the ruling class engages in without repercussion. Just please remember to not make this a ""democratic witch hunt"" or a partisan thing. It's extremely important to remain neutral, if you want to reach people and get them to embrace what may be happening within these elite circles.",conspiracy,QAnon
60,"If you don’t know what “controlled opposition” is by now as a conspiracy theorist, you need to figure it out. Many of your “heros” are actually government agents. Rogan, Alex Jones, Qanon.

I find it’s usually either one of two categories of people that still fall for these dumb shit puppets...

1. Younger people or people new to conspiracy culture who were introduced or had their critical thinking virginity taken by one of these agents. 

2. People who resonate with the partisan bias or political talking points of one of the agents, almost always a conservative leaning bias.


Also, you don’t understand how powerful and pervasive the elites and their global crime syndicate really is, if you assume these “heros” or people like Alex Jones or Rogan who get tons of publicity and a large following are truly anti establishment. If they were, they would be quietly compromised or “dealt with” in a covert and discrete fashion. No waves, just quiet and covert neutralization. 

They are allowed to remain on the air or retain relevancy because they provide you with a false sense of opposition. This way, not only do they control you and appease your desire for an opposing voice or a savior, but they prevent any real opposing figures from surfacing and gaining traction, Because they are dominating the landscape.

So yea, let’s grow up and ditch these fucking clowns. 


**EDIT: And while we’re at it, let’s ditch that stupid ass left right political nonsense.

Here’s a theory for you! I wouldn’t doubt that Biden and his elite pedo friends/family, as well as almost every other politician, hand picks each child/teen immigrant for their human sex trafficking business. Makes a whole lot of sense when you think about it. Why is everything kept such a secret? It really doesn’t add up at all. Not even the press??? Something smells super FISHY 🐠 💩

Curious to hear your thoughts on why the Biden Administration placed a gag order on border patrol. Let’s play a game when answering: can’t blame this crisis on Trump! Biden literally campaigned for months telling immigrants to come on over, it will get better, blah blah blah. There are interviews with actual immigrants at the border stating they came over due to Biden. Can’t make that shit up. Sound off in the comments below.

69,My goodbye message to all spiritually awakened people on r/conspiracy.,186.0,g5mjis,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5mjis/my_goodbye_message_to_all_spiritually_awakened/,59.0,1587499502.0,"So, it’s time for me to bid adieu to **r/conspiracy**, and I primarily wish to address this message to spiritually awakened folks on here – in the hope that this presents them with a newer and better perspective on things.  

Many of you might already be aware of the *Law Of Attraction* -- which states that what you focus on, you continue to get more of. Focus on positive energies to get positive people, outcomes, events, things, experiences and POSITIVE REALITIES in your life. Focus on all of the negativity and negative stuff, and you’ll keep attracting similar-energy stuff based upon the “like attracts like” principle/formula.  

As a long time active member of this subreddit, I have long been into exposing stuff – as a result of which I have had [**numerous altercations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/flowie/exposed_shills_who_gaslight_people_on_rconspiracy/) with the [**shills on here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g1arq6/the_greatest_expose_of_rconspiracy_shilling_ever/) over a considerable time period. My job was to **seed truth** [**against all odds**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4whrz/anyone_else_notice_how_posts_regarding_specific/), against a [**thoroughly rigged system**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g27o3l/rigged_reddit_front_page/), against [**individuals who repeatedly gaslight us**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g2e6kb/seeing_way_too_many_posts_on_here_worried_about/), against [**two-faced and people’s-favourite politicians**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g0zes1/so_bernie_sanders_is_now_supporting_a_rapist/), against [**Redditors’ double standards**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g26r7g/alexandria_ocasiocortez_destroys_biden_shills_its/), and against every single person who is hell bent on promoting [**elite-manufactured narratives**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g3qhfx/snowden_vs_qanon_whos_right_the_answer_stares_us/).  

It’s not that I’ve only been [**exposing people here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g0qtq1/ladies_and_gentlemen_greta_thunberg/) -- I've also been [**thanking people**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g1w25m/a_big_thank_you_to_everyone_for_posting_the_out/), [**warning people**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g49ihz/an_urgent_message_for_all_new_earth_timeline/), and [**encouraging people**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/frd0qo/global_pandemic_or_global_gift/) to see the LIGHT that awaits us all at the end of this rather dark tunnel. That having been said – I believe that now is the time for me to quit this place. Let me explain why.  

One, this place is no longer a place for the [**TRUTH**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fld65g/feeling_something_off_about_reality_lately_heres/). For instead of killing this sub *openly,* Reddit has decided to take the route of [**infiltrating and infesting the whole place**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g415w5/meta_the_supposedly_massive_nationwide/) using [**agents of darkness**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4soy5/reddit_doing_anything_and_everything_to_push_the/) and [**messages of hopelessness**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fn42lr/is_anyone_else_just_in_complete_disbelief_that/). From [**outright mockery**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fwhj1n/theres_an_increasing_amount_of_people_on_this_sub/) and [**openly encouraged shilling**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g54qcx/i_think_i_discovered_a_conspiracy_to_game_reddit/) to [**obvious gaslighting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5900c/this_community_is_infested_with_shills_trolls_and/) and [**not-so-obvious deceptions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ywa9/an_account_created_exactly_12_hours_ago_makes_a/), the elite-puppet Reddit has been using [**the** ***exact*** **same tools**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4sisf/just_in_case_you_still_havent_figured_it_out/) that have by been recklessly (ab)used and overused beyond all recognition now by the *“utterly reliable”* [**mainstream media**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ts3q/using_propaganda_to_shape_public_perceptions_of/) that just about everyone **so mindlessly** believes in.  

But if only that was all. For you see, when mods start deleting **THE TRUTH** because the [**text was emboldened**]( https://i.imgur.com/LX3cifW.png) or because someone dared to commit the unspeakable atrocity that is [**using emojis correctly**]( https://i.imgur.com/uF6QkSQ.png); but don’t apply the same standards to shills and bots – to the extent that [**everyone starts saying this stuff**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g55m11/extremely_disappointed_this_is_the_end_of/); you know that your time for hanging out in this sub looking for TRUTHS is up for sure. I mean, I’ve literally gotten modmails at this point asking me “not to call anyone a shill” (even if you have proof) and “not to name or call out shills openly (even if it is WITH EVIDENCE), or **RISK GETTING BANNED.** I mean, is this even a TRUTH SUB at this point?  

But there’s a far bigger concern that I wish to address here -- and that one has a helluva lot to do with *introspection.* For you see, like I said earlier, the more that one focuses upon negative realities, argues with people, gets mad, gets fearful, gets angry, and overall becomes agitated and negative -- the EASIER it is for them to attract the **EXACT NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES** that they were so diligently looking to avoid (by spreading truths) to begin with. If “what you focus on, you attract” is true (and experience has indeed taught me that such is so) -- then my coming here and arguing and fighting those-of-lesser-light only serves THEIR cause. Entering into a mud puddle to wrestle a pig doesn’t get the pig dirty, but it sure does get YOU dirty (and the pig just *loves it* anyways) Besides, by going near a pig to begin with, the **pig** never gets *uplifted* -- but **you** most certainly do come down to *their low level of existence*. And [**I’m not even the only one**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g2kvfm/take_a_break_from_conspiracy_if_you_need_it/) who has started seeing this **TRUTH** *so very clearly now.*  

Guys, let me make it real simple for you all. The *time window* for spiritually awakening and CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSING one’s desired timeline of choice (be it positive or negative) has been open for quite some time now, however, it is *fast closing now* even as we speak. Our job, as beacons of truth and LIGHT, was to assist in dropping and seeding just enough TRUTHS and HINTS for the masses to DO THE RESEARCH FOR THEMSELVES and **WAKE THE FUCK UP.** However, the time for assisting others is **now PAST** – and now – it is *about time* that we focused on our creating *OWN positive reality manifestations*. (Remember what they say in flight safety announcements here, “Secure your own mask *first,* before even as much as *thinking* of assisting *others* with *their masks*.”) Else, we would **for sure be left here** (within these negative timelines) to rot -- and that too for *ages to come*, WITHOUT any faults of our own whatsoever. We have seeded enough truths within the mass collective consciousness (and these subreddits etc.) for the people to find and learn from; and now, it is about time that we all moved up into the next level of (higher) existence, once and for all. It sounds harsh – I know – but then again, **everyone’s had their shot at awakening**. If all of them are **still unable to** spot the TRUTH *despite it parading* [**butt-naked right in front of them**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g46rbn/i_feel_this_life/) – well, they have made their *choice*, and all choices come with their respective [**consequences**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g53a9w/source_theorists_the_governments_have_already/). And so it is. And so it is.  

To conclude, [**arguments no longer serve us**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4zeyq/a_reminder_for_anyone_who_is_having_trouble/), [**wise words such as these**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4h3ru/it_is_the_mark_of_an_educated_mind_to_be_able_to/) aren’t “cool
/“trendy” enough to awaken the sleeping/brainwashed masses; and if people STILL CANNOT SEE [**the obvious traps**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4t61z/we_are_falling_right_into_their_hands/) for what they are, the [**truths hiding in plain sight**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/g5du8t/lol/) or the [**openly done abuses of power and wealth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5cmiw/do_you_remember/) -- then this is the reality that they have, unfortunately, *most willingly chosen*; and there is a [***price to be paid***](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/g565bs/disney_to_stop_paying_100000_workers_but_is_still/) for choosing to remain a blind slave to the system here.  

Ultimately, spiritual awakening is *everyone’s own personal responsibility*; and **no one else can do someone’s work** ***for them.*** Then, it is upto us ourselves, to [**say NO to deceptions and fear-based programming**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4la13/i_personally_have_not_watched_tv_or_news_since/), see the [**truth about things**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fugs23/robert_f_kennedys_granddaughter_and_her_8_year/) in [**patterns that repeat**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4oor8/young_successful_entrepreneur_involved_in_brain/) endlessly [**over and over and over**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fuy0ac/doorknob_sacrifices_a_story_of_12_celebrity/); and **listen to the brave souls that bring us TRUTHS** [**at great cost**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g0s2yq/robert_f_kennedy_jr_exposes_bill_gates_vaccine/), continuously, consistently, and [**day after day after day**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g3dfvr/robert_f_kennedy_jr_drops_new_bombshell_bill/).  

After all, it is EVERY PERSON’S JOB to [**ask the right questions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5aq20/why_do_people_get_so_offended_if_you_mention_you/), [**see the consequences**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/g4svt0/novak_djokovic_reveals_hes_an_antivaxxer_and_it/) of [***not toeing*** **the line that is the** ***“officially approved narrative”***]( https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-8240029/Novak-Djokovics-wife-shamed-False-Information-badge-Instagram-5G-conspiracy.html), and [**notice the OBVIOUS PATTERNS**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g25yij/the_closer_to_reality_a_post_is_the_closer_to_0/) within ALL OF THE SHIT that (silently and sneakily) goes on all around you, **24x7x365.**  

So, there is no place for me now on a sub that is okay with propaganda, mockery, shilling and name-calling (instead of discussing arguments, evidence etc.) and BANNING *that which is OF TRUTH* by giving the *most ridiculous of reasons* **ever conceived by mankind.**  

And just to be very, very clear here -- this is NOT me “backing down” (from seeding the truth) or “being afraid” or “giving up” my cause of *spreading the light* whenever and wherever I so can. For such is so NOT my way -- and I wouldn’t have written all of those posts if it was. Instead, this is me choosing a **better, faster and more EFFECTIVE approach** to creating that which is a **higher, more positive, and more LOVING reality** -- and for THAT to happen, I can no longer focus, indulge in, entertain, or even give as much as a *passing thought to* negative realities, negative entities, dark agendas, and the like. For the great awakening is here indeed -- and they, for one, are **SO NOT GONNA LIKE IT** when the [**fires of truth begin to tickle their dangling legs**]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY8Nfzcn1qQ), *one toe at a time.*  

So I’ll leave you all now with a [**positive message of hope**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fld65g/feeling_something_off_about_reality_lately_heres/) and this [**UTTERLY BEAUTIFUL POST by u/mistahbang**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/fmbcn9/a_little_guide_to_wtf_is_going_on/) that will succinctly explain to you as to *what’s really up* and what *isn’t*. Use this time wisely to rest, heal, get creative, do things that excite you, and overall rest in the beautiful and positive vibes (frequencies) of Love, Peace, Joy, Abundance, Bliss, Relaxation and (most importantly) **Gratitude** -- and **KNOW FOR A FACT** that a better world is coming your way -- *very, very shortly.* **Trust the plan.**  

---

The frequencies of this place are no longer worth entertaining **even for another second**, and I’ll recommend to one and all who wish to spiritually evolve and move on to the 5D Earth to **leave this place** ***for GOOD.***  

**For THEY** (the unawakened ones) have (knowingly or unknowingly) chosen and written their own (negative) destinies -- and we ought to respect their divine Free Will choices in this regard. That being said, it is **NOW** time indeed for you all to choose and write and rewrite **your own destinies,** and to ***choose (those) wisely*** at that. Peace and love and light be upon you -- and **thank you ALL for accompanying me on this long and exciting journey into uncovering, exploring and EXPOSING the TRUTH** -- **and** ***endlessly at that.*** Cheers, and much love and blessings to you *ALL.* **Peace.**",conspiracy,QAnon

Here's how we win.](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ijo5bf/cracking_the_corona_cult_unwavering_commitment_to/)

Note how some of the commenters in that /r/worldnews thread realize they've been duped, but they're desperately trying to justify it somehow:

This person realizes the scam, but they're still trying to explain it away:

>And it doesn't excuse folks who don't have pre-existing/underlying conditions from doing their part to keep the ones with pre-existing/underlying conditions from getting the virus! They have to stay in a bubble while the rest of us get to frolic? That's not empathetic to your fellow American and that's un-American.

You hear that? Some fat fuck hasn't been exercising for 2 decades...that means YOU have to stay inside forever, and not doing so is UNAMERICAN.

Do you see the cognitive dissonance oozing from this sentiment?

Fortunately, the wall of deception is coming down in an unprecedented way.

Also, isn't it amusing how the Mockingbird Media has weaponized the concept of ""Qanon"" to attack conspiracy theorists and independent thinkers? It's the most transparent bullshit of all.

People are waking in massive droves because of the sheer audacity and stupidity of the coronavirus deception:

>Apparently Twitter doesn't want people asking questions about why we nuked the future over this and why everything is still closed six months after we were told ""just two weeks of lockdown to stop the virus"" and ""if we don't lock down there will be rotting corpses piled up outside overcrowded hospitals"".

>Except that it is straight from the CDC website saying that 94% of the deaths attributed to COVID had 2-3 other comorbidities. Without those, you have 6% dead

>a Special Call Out and Thanks to our Communist REDDIt for making sure no actual or even slightly real pro-trump comments are allowed ...also thanks for making sure all we get to discuss in World News is what you want us to talk about,...WHO Narratives...Yay experimental mRNA Vaccines for everyone !!!

(lol)

>Straight from the CDC. You people really want COVID to be a Black Plague, and will do anything to continuously instill fear and make people think it’s much worse than it is. Nothing more than a severe flu

This hits at the heart of the corona cult.

They HAVE to keep believing it's deadly to justify the entirety of the last 6 months.

These individuals will never admit they've been duped to such a profound degree.

>It wasnt false. Cnn wrote a bs fact check article about how the journo said 6K people died from coronavirus total, then in the same article used circular logic and proved her point. The journos tweet said coronavirus ""only"" which is what the cdc metric actually says. The rest of the deaths all had co morbidity like diabetes, heart disease, immune deficiency disorders due to advanced age, etc.

>I think its more important to ask why social media is banning information like this, from renowned epidemiologist, foreign studies, doctors, positive info on drugs that are debatable, counter arguments, based on biased agenda driven news outlets like CNN.

Get ready...they will get increasingly desperate as the coronavirus narrative continues to collapse.

Sadly, once this inevitably passes, many of these individuals will forget everything and pretend they were right all along.

It's ok though...so many people have woken up now because of this insanity than ever before. The cat's outta the bag on this one, and the psychotic so-called ""elite"" are moribund.",conspiracy,QAnon

There were 41 new cases, just over 1000 active cases and 7 deaths recorded today in a state wide population of 6.5 million. Masks are enforced here “for the foreseeable future”, even in tiny towns out in regional victoria where I live.

It makes it look like this community is all in on the Q nonsense because the OP tagged all of those stupid creepy fucking soundbytes and phrases like “WWG1WGA” etc. 

Look, TPTB don’t want their political assets implicated in a pedophilia or sex trafficking scandal. The last thing they want is the sitting president, their most important and valuable asset, to have his image tarnished with the public (both sides united against him). They are ok with the public parroting the establishment approved criticisms like Russia gate or “Trump is racist”, because those are inconsequential and are just there to create little drama and division among the public. But the pedophilia stuff can actually be dangerous because it can unite people and transcend partisan barriers because of how sick and twisted it is. 

So they drummed up this phony ass secret internet sleuth to pretend to be an “insider” and portray Trump and his administration as good guys tackling corruption, to buy them some time and maintain support from the conspiracy theorists/truth movement.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Trump was selected as a false prophet for us to rally behind, to neutralize us and provide us with the illusion of a savior or a good guy on our side, and the Q shit  just reinforces this. They’re trying to make conspiracy theorists look like hardcore right wingers, and you could argue which in turn makes us look racist/insensitive, and the shills DEFINITELY reinforce that (just look at some of the subs that make fun of r/conspiracy, 80% of the content is “get a load of these racist goofballs).

These people are basically advertising Q not stopping it. 

These people also type like 12 year old children on a school yard.

Man shills used to be fucking Intelligent here, wherever you came from,. Please tell your leader the narrative you're pushing is fucking stupid.

This comes from a concerned truth seeker not a fucking qanon or any politician supporter, I walk to the sound of my own fucking tunes.",conspiracy,QAnon
85,Elon Musk,146.0,gaymou,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gaymou/elon_musk/,57.0,1588263116.0,"Yeah I know this one's going to get downvoted on here before I even post this (because you know, it's TRUTH and the shills on this sub have a massive hate-boner for it) but I'll make it quick.  

There seems to be a lot of confusion on whether Elon Musk is one of the ""good guys"" or one of the ""bad guys"". In situations such as these, it is always a wise idea to see as to what such persons are DOING as opposed to what they are SAYING. I repeat, **DOING > SAYING**. And when you do that, it gets **real obvious real quick** as to the **TRUE agendas** of these kinds and varieties of people.  

Here's what Elon Musk is **DOING:**  

He is making **NeuraLink** a thing.  

He is literally **LAUNCHING A SHITLOAD OF 5G SATELLITES** into our skies as we speak.  

*(This is very important)* He hasn't uttered a SINGLE WORD against vaccinations or Mr. Gates till date.  

Dude is a part of the Billionaire elite, has a past that is notorious for extremely shady treatment of his own employees and even has pics with Ghislaine Maxwell (don't tell me that he as an elite had no idea as to *who* he was posing with here).  

He has been into digging TUNNELS under the USA. I don't need to tell anyone (on **r/conspiracy** of all places) as to *what exactly* happens in underground tunnels - despite the many ""support-worthy"" reasons being given for the same by this particular individual.  

Elon Musk seems to have a thing for making fear-based doomsday predictions. I mean, I'm sure most of you on here have seen his Joe Rogan interview. **How many spiritually evolved individuals of THE LIGHT have you seen spreading mass fear this way?** (In fact, WHO within our world has been known to use fear, anger, hatred and other such negative thoughts/intentions/energies to their advantage here?)

But then, you will say, what about all of the good things? All of the electric cars, solar roof tiles and the whole Mars colonization thing? What about him ""hinting things"" by asking as to who owns the entire media?  

It's an easy explanation. The powers-that-were have a time-tested control and manipulation formula. Mix a little bit of truth in between a little bit of lies. Again: **Mix a little bit of truth in between a little bit of lies.** That way, you are always able to maintain plausible deniability. That way, when someone asks you as to ""why did you never speak about the elite?"" -- you can point to a [**""cryptic"" tweet such as this one**](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1000560049389907969) (useful in appeasing US conservatives). That way, when someone asks you ""why didn't you do something about global warming?"" -- you can point out your solar roof tiles and electric cars and how you are taking on the Saudi Oil Establishment all alone (this appeases the US liberals). By the way, the oil lobby, pharma lobby, or any other lobby wouldn't let you LIVE TOO LONG if you weren't on their side in some way. Or at the very best, you would be harassed like anything [**like they did to this guy**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/maeve-kennedy-granddaughter-missing.html).  

**So when you are NOT getting harassed, STILL LIVING, drilling fucking tunnels under the USA with whatever excuses you are making for that, NOT saying A SINGLE WORD against Bill Gates or Vaccinations, and finally, making Neura-Fucking-Link and other AI tools of all things, you have NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF GOOD left within you.** Because our man here likes to ride two boats at once and appease both aspects of the equation (as it works within the US i.e. ""the left"" and ""the right"") at the same time. But such tricks aren't going to work any longer, for the *Great Awakening* is here indeed.  

**You want the LEGIT TRUTH SPEAKERS?** Look at all of the people who are getting **shunned** by one and all. The people who are putting their **VERY LIVES on the line** as their **loved ones are getting slaughtered** by the elite. The people who aren't giving ""cryptic hints"" and fucking ""smoke signals"" (it is no *coincidence here* that the elites are famous for conjuring illusions using ""smoke and mirrors""), but are instead, **TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AS IT IS** ***DESPITE ALL COSTS.***  

**THOSE are the people that you need to be supporting.** ***Truly BRAVE*** **individuals such as** [**Robert. F. Kennedy Junior**](https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr). Not this two-faced Musk scum.  

End of post.  

**EDIT:** For all of those who asked. **How exactly does Musk's agenda even work here?** Here's the full story.  

Basically, the deep state elite / cabal / Illuminati (whatever you wanna call em) wanted to off of most of humanity here through this virus -- which is why you see that kind of a plotline as the story to *nearly all Sci-Fi content* that you currently consume be it shows, movies, comics, or *what-have-you.* Yeah, predictive programming and all of that sorta stuff. So, getting to the point, [**the gang wanted to kill off the maximum global population**](https://www.westernjournal.com/report-obama-admin-funded-chinas-coronavirus-research-gave-millions-taxpayer-money-wuhan-lab/) using this virus, crash the economy, and then create a New World Order of enslaved masses using *vaccine-delivered-microchips* -- in order that they may be able to *then* continue ruling this vast slave-planet joyfully and freely. They wanted to have everyone wear **masks,** symbolic of the **""we'll do whatever the fuck we want right in front of you and you'll all keep your mouths fucking shut out of FEAR""**. Much like what you see in bondage-porn. Control. Dominance. Power-over-others. Which is one victory that they did get, mind you. But then, the *plot went sideways.*  

You see, these elites are not the *only intelligent entities* upon our world (or beyond it). Neither are they as powerful as they think themselves to be. So, suffice it to say that they all got a little, errrrr....*outsmarted* here.  

Their plan to open a negative energy vortex/timeline using the CERN Hadron Collider and to grant [**dark beings access**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/701484/Satanic-human-sacrifice-video-CERN) into our dimension was derailed by [**gas leaks**](https://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn16254-damage-that-derailed-higgs-hunt/), [**bird droppings**](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/06/cern-big-bang-goes-phut), and [**actual fucking weasels**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36173247) showing up to ruin the party. But our dark friends refused to learn their lesson.  

So instead of ""Pandemic 1"" killing off most of the human populace and getting the rest to obediently stand in line (in order to get chipped right back to slavery) [**other un-wanted things ensued**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/frd0qo/global_pandemic_or_global_gift/). Furthermore, as the [**masses started awakening**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fzpxdm/99_of_comments_on_bill_gatess_social_media_say/) and plenty of their lot started getting arrested, put in home-quarantine or ""getting the virus"" (code for [**getting killed**](https://www.eonline.com/news/1135492/spanish-princess-becomes-the-first-royal-to-die-of-coronavirus-complications) OR [**being quarantined for mass-trials later**](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/coronavirus-widespread-among-saudi-royal-family-report/ar-BB12nyMj) ) their plans just started going [**south**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/royals/king-felipe-of-spain-s-relative-86-becomes-first-royal-to-die-from-coronavirus/ar-BB11Q7uO) after [**south**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/covid-19-prince-charles-tests-positive-remains-in-self-isolation-in-scotland/articleshow/74810710.cms) after [**south**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8200269/Coronavirus-spreads-party-Venezuelan-elite.html), day after day after day.  

You see, it just so happens that this virus that they so carefully made to destroy humanity, happens to be super-lethal for Adrenochrome users. So all of those pre-created vaccines that so many of them took so happily before this epidemic got its ""worldwide release"" may not, well, *work* as nicely as they'd all hoped. Expect many, many more names of elites dying (due to Covid-19) to be hitting the news as we go along here. And before you even ask folks, YES, they [**ALL KNEW**](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/03/296939/insider-trading-us-senators-sold-stocks-before-covid-19-crash/) WHAT WAS COMING [**SINCE LONG, LONG, BACK**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fyy370/2013_rapper_predicts_2020_combined_with/fn2ju84/).   

Finally, the main question: **WHY EXACTLY is Elon Musk** ***doing*** **all of this?** Good question. You see, a few days back, [**these interesting videos**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9kzks/id_watch_these_coronavirus_protests_for_hours/) topped the [**very front page of Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9fxxg/usa/) with *all of the medals in the world* -- BOTH (front page + medal getting) being super sureshot signs here that all of the mainstream media **REALLY WANTED YOU TO SEE** *all of that stuff.* And oh by the way, both Elon Musk and Reddit posted this stuff out on the exact same day, because [**the NARRATIVE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4sisf/just_in_case_you_still_havent_figured_it_out/) must [**ALWAYS be consistent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ts3q/using_propaganda_to_shape_public_perceptions_of) ***no-matter-what.*** And obviously, most right-wingers wouldn't question how the entire video seems staged (just check out the presentation, background music used), right down to this [**super-pathetic actor dude**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g7fwve/can_you_cough_in_my_face/) and his *fake-as-fuck-talk* in which he lists out **every single ""tinfoil-hatter-conspiracy-nutjob-trope-there-is""** right down to the last fucking T? With *Flat-Earth* and all of that shit included? Yes folks. Many or all of those folks that you saw in those videos were actors infiltrating the protests.  

But why even **do** all of this? *What exactly* does one stand to gain from all of this counter-lockdown protesting? It's easy. You see, by NOW painting the lockdown as a ""left-wing conspiracy"" (because their mass murder plans failed and THEY started getting arrested instead (whereas the normal people simply remained SAFE inside their own homes), they realised that they were losing and LOSING HARD. So what is the last fucking option that they all had *left* here? That's right. *Much like a cornered animal BITES and SCRATCHES and SWINGS madly at ALL THAT IT SEES,* so too did **they all decide** that now is the time to get everyone *pouring out of their homes* so that *everyone that they have ever ruled over* **""go down with them""**. And by giving this a polarized and divisive ""Right v/s Left"" narrative here (and using Elon's previously built appeal towards the right-wing folks to their own benefit), they thought that NOW was the time indeed to *kill one and all.* Basically, the ""if we're going down then we are going down *with you""* approach. So by getting you all out NOW, it is super-easy to [**co-ordinate some crazy ass mass shootings**](https://qanon.pub/data/media/8ab5a5a0c1b486bb298c3011a9d88c52b511755f5e30a0d9dbc3ecb3e159aa25.png) like they've always done before.  

Also notable here is the fact that the elites are **REQUIRED BY DIVINE LAW** to **always state** their **true** intentions in some way, shape, or form here in front of the masses. Which is why you see them doing all of that predictive programming and [**hand-signs**](https://i.redd.it/q6n3qv8e8ns41.png) and all of that shit [**all over the internet**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/5e/e1/ba5ee165345bdcf7149f9c2d90a5d549.jpg) for [**all to see**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a1/29/11a12931d039c27f965fde5b4b013051.png). Which is why you will now be able to see our dear friend Elon Musk sporting a display picture that says [**Deus Ex Machina**](https://i.imgur.com/SXCiC1q.png). For the uninitiated, that means, and I quote [**the Oxford Dictionary here**](https://i.imgur.com/itWfnja.png) as saying  

> ""An **unexpected power or event** saving a **seemingly hopeless situation,** especially as a **contrived plot device** in a **play** or novel""  

Also, ""Necromancer"" above (captioned below the display picture) stands for, and I [**once again quote the Oxford Dictionary on this**](https://i.imgur.com/oYCgFXD.png),  

> ""A person who practices necromancy; a wizard or magician"" and ""magic involving communication with the dead"". Interestingly enough, it also names a certain [**Dr. Faustus**](https://i.imgur.com/oYCgFXD.png) as a *""16th century necromancer.""* Hmm. **Dr Faustus.** Where exactly have I heard *that name* before? Man, I sure as hell just can't seem to be able to [***place it*** **anywhere**](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11507231/dr-fauci-7-4-million-funding-wuhan-lab-blamed-covid-19-conspiracy/).  

Alas. *This part of the plan* isn't going to work as smoothly as they'd hoped either. Because the people are now all awakening. And because, *it is now time* for this entire Great Awakening ride to get just a little *wilder.* Thank you for reading.  

**EDIT 2:** On *tremendously* popular demand, I've made the above edit as a [**separate post of its own here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gb3gob/the_complete_untold_coronavirus_lockdown_story/) for all of you to easily be able to link to your friends, relatives, acquaintances, social media followers and such here.

1. Hunter Biden brokered deals on behalf of his father (the big guy) with the CCP, Ukraine, Burisma, Russians and many others
2. Joe was paid up to 50c in the dollar for these deals
3. Hunter lived a debauched lifestyle on this bribe money

1. The FBI has had this information since 2019

4. The DNC has known about this for a long time

Project Briefing and Background

In 1972, in a remote section of northern New Mexico, a group of hikers discovered an unusual artifact and pictographs within an obscure canyon. An archeologist from the University of New Mexico analyzed the artifact and searched the area where it was discovered, but found no signs that a prehistoric culture had established any permanent site in the canyon. It was presumed that a nomadic, Native American Indian tribe had occasionally used the canyon as a temporary settlement and had left behind a few artifacts of their presence as a consequence.
There were, however, two very puzzling questions. All but one of the artifacts could be dated to the 8th century AD. The exception, known as the ""compass"" artifact, appeared to be an unusual form of technology, and was found among more typical artifacts like pottery and simple tools. The compass was covered in strange hieroglyphic symbols, some of which were also found on the pottery. Secondly, the pictographs that were found in the area had inexplicably appeared, and they were strikingly different than any of the other native petroglyphs or rock art found in the southwest or the entire continent for that matter.

Because of these two anomalies, the artifacts and the entire project quickly became the property of the US government, or more specifically, the National Security Agency. It was decided that these artifacts might suggest a pre-historical, extraterrestrial presence on earth, and that the NSA had the appropriate agenda and wherewithal to initiate a full-scale, scientific expedition to determine the nature and significance of the site.

The site was completely searched by a secret department of the NSA in 1973, but it only resulted in a few additional findings, and none of them were designated as technologies or evidence of an extraterrestrial presence. Additional pictographic symbols were found, but decoding them was a difficult and frustrating process. Experts were called in to help, but it was impossible to reach a consensus as to what the pictographs meant. As quickly as the project had risen as a priority investigation, it fell into the archives of the NSA under the code name, Ancient Arrow.

Twenty-one years later, in 1994, a series of rockslides opened up a section of the Ancient Arrow site. The canyon was in a naturally obscure section of park land held by the state of New Mexico. After its discovery in 1972, it had been officially sanctioned off-limits to hikers and campers and was to be left in its natural state. From time-to-time, scientists -- sponsored by the NSA -- would visit the site hoping to uncover new evidence, but were invariably disappointed.


Shortly after the rockslide occurrence, a small team of operatives from the NSA visited Ancient Arrow canyon to do some follow-up research. They discovered the rockslide had exposed an entrance to a hidden cavern that led deep within the canyon walls.

At the back of this cavern, the research team discovered a well-hidden entrance into the interior of the canyon wall or rock structure of the Ancient Arrow site. There they found a system of tunnels and chambers that had been carved out from solid rock. There were a total of 23 chambers, all intricately connected to an interior corridor, and each chamber held a specific wall painting, series of pictographs, written hieroglyphs, and what seemed to be dormant, alien technologies.


Once this entrance to the cavern was found, a report was immediately filed with the Director responsible for the Ancient Arrow project. The project was then formally brought under the jurisdiction of the Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization (ACIO), which organized an inter-disciplinary research team to assess the exact nature of the site and attempt to discover additional artifacts or evidence of an extraterrestrial visitation.

TEASER FROM THE INTERVIEWS:

Anne: ""When you say 'visiting you', what evidence did you have that the WingMakers might be visiting you?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I was spending 70 hours per week working on the decoding formulas for the symbol pictures, and this went on for about 8 months. During this time I tried every conceivable combination to create an access code to the optical disc. I was convinced it was the only way to open it. I was also convinced that it was purposely made to be difficult, at least to our presentday brains. It was almost as though the struggle to decode their language was exercising a part of my brain or nervous system that was enabling me to communicate with them.

""I began to hear them speaking to me. It began as a word or two . . . then a sentence . . . maybe just once a day. It didn't make much sense . . . what I heard. But then one day I was working on a chamber painting and I saw something move in the painting. One of the symbols moved and it was absolutely not an illusion or trick of the light. Then I realized that the WingMakers could interact with me, that they were time traveling to my time and that somehow their paintings were actually portals in which they moved through time.

""It was then I began to hear their instructions, or more precisely, their thoughts. I was given mental images on how to use the Sumerian language to decode their own symbol pictures. I thought I was possibly going crazy. I felt like my mind was playing tricks on me . . . that I was working too hard and needed to take a holiday, but I listened to the voices because it seemed plausible what I was being instructed to do. When I finished with the access code and it worked, I knew then that I was indeed communicating with them. Anne: ""Did you tell anyone? I mean about the fact that you were communicating with the WingMakers?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I kept it a secret. I wasn't sure how I would be able to explain the phenomenon and I didn't want to arouse suspicions, so I went about my business and began developing the translation indexes for the 8,110 pages of text that was discovered within the optical disc. It was essential that we had a letter-for-letter index in order to retain the meaning of their language . . . we called this translation granularity. And as I started the process of translating the optical disc, I began to see fragment images of the WingMakers . . . sort of like a holographic image that would appear and then disappear in a matter of seconds.

""They visited me a total of three times -- always in my home at night -- and told me that I had been selected to be their liaison or spokesperson. Of course I asked them why me and not Fifteen, and they said that Fifteen was unable to speak for them because he was already the pawn of the Corteum.""

Anne:""Tell me about Fifteen. What is he like?""


Dr. Anderson: ""Fifteen is a genius of unparalleled intelligence and knowledge. He's the leader of the Labyrinth Group and has been since its inception in 1963. He was only 22 [twenty-two] years old when he joined the ACIO in 1956. I think he was discovered early enough before he had a chance to establish a reputation in academic circles. He was a renegade genius who wanted to build computers that would be powerful enough to time travel. Can you imagine how a goal like that -- in the mid-1950s -- must have sounded to his professors?

""Needless to say, he was not taken seriously, and was essentially told to get in line with academic protocols and perform serious research. Fifteen came to the ACIO through an alliance it had with Bell Labs. Somehow Bell Labs heard about his genius and hired him, but he quickly out-paced their research agenda and wanted to apply his vision of time travel."" Anne: ""Why was he so interested in time travel?""

Dr. Anderson: ""No one is absolutely sure. And his reasons may have changed over time. The accepted purpose was to develop Blank Slate Technology or BST. BST is a form of time travel that enables the re-write of history at what are called intervention points. Intervention points are the causal energy centers that create a major event like the break-up of the Soviet Union or the NASA space program.

""BST is the most advanced technology and clearly anyone who is in possession of BST, can defend themselves against any aggressor. It is, as Fifteen was fond of saying, the freedom key. Remember that the ACIO was the primary interface with extraterrestrial technologies and how to adapt them into mainstream society as well as military applications. We were exposed to ETs and knew of their agenda. Some of these ETs scared the hell out of the ACIO.""

Anne: ""Why?""

Dr. Anderson: ""There were agreements between our government -- specifically the NSA -- to cooperate with an ET species commonly called the Greys in exchange for their cooperation to stay hidden and conduct their biological experiments under the cloak of secrecy. There was also a bungled technology transfer program, but that's another story . . . [--] However, not all the Greys were operating within a unified agenda. There were certain groups of Greys that looked upon humans in much the same way as we look upon laboratory animals. ""They're abducting humans and animals, and have been for the past 48 [forty-eight] years . . . [--] they're essentially conducting biological experiments to determine how their genetics can be made to be compatible with human and animal genetic structure. Their interests are not entirely

understood, but if you accept their stated agenda, it's to perpetuate their species. Their species is nearing extinction and they're fearful that their biological system lacks the emotional development to harness their technological prowess in a responsible manner. ""Fifteen was approached by the Greys in his role at the ACIO, and they desired to provide a fullscale technology transfer program, but Fifteen turned them down. He had already established a TTP with the Corteum, and felt that the Greys were too fractured organizationally to make good on their promises. Furthermore, the Corteum technology was superior in most regards to the Greys . . . [--] with the possible exception of the Greys' memory implant and their genetic hybridization technologies.

""However, Fifteen and the entire Labyrinth Group carefully considered an alliance with the Greys if for no other reason than to have direct communication with regard to their stated agenda. Fifteen liked to be in the know . . . [--] so eventually we did establish an alliance, which consisted of a modest information exchange between us. We provided them with access to our information systems relative to genetic populations and their unique predisposition across a variety of criteria including mental, emotional, and physical behaviors; and they provided us with their genetic findings.


""The Greys, and most extraterrestrials for that matter, communicate with humans exclusively through a form of telepathy, which we called suggestive telepathy because to us it seemed that the Greys communicated in a such a way that they were trying to lead a conversation to a particular end. In other words, they always had an agenda, and we were never certain if we were a pawn of their agenda or we arrived at conclusions that were indeed our own. ""I think that's why Fifteen didn't trust the Greys. He felt they used communication to manipulate outcomes to their own best interest in favor of shared interests. And because of this lack of trust, Fifteen refused to form any alliance or TTP that was comprehensive or integral to our operations at either the ACIO or the Labyrinth Group.""

Anne: ""Did the Greys know of the existence of the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I don't believe so. They were generally convinced that humans were not clever enough to cloak their agendas. Our analysis was that the Greys had invasive technologies that gave them a false sense of security as to their enemy's weaknesses. And I'm not saying that we were enemies, but we never trusted them. And this they undoubtedly knew. They also knew that the ACIO had technologies and intellects that were superior to the mainstream human population, and they had a modicum of respect -- perhaps even fear -- of our abilities.

""However, we never showed them any of our pure-state technologies or engaged them in deep dialogues concerning cosmology or new physics. They were clearly interested in our information databases and this was their primary agenda with respect to the ACIO. Fifteen was the primary interface with the Greys because they sensed a comparable intellect in him. The Greys looked at Fifteen as the equivalent of our planet's CEO.""

Anne: ""How did Fifteen become the leader of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""He was the Director of Research in 1958 when the Corteum first became known to the ACIO. In this position, he was the logical choice to assess their technology and determine its value to the ACIO. The Corteum instantly took a liking to him, and one of Fifteen's first decisions was to utilize the Corteum intelligence accelerator technologies on himself. After about three months of experimentation (most of which was not in his briefing reports to the then current Executive Director of the ACIO), Fifteen became infused with a massive vision of how to create BST.

""The Executive Director was frightened by the intensity of Fifteen's BST agenda and felt that it would divert too much of the ACIO's resources to a technology development program that was dubious. Fifteen was enough of a renegade that he enlisted the help of the Corteum to establish the Labyrinth Group. The Corteum were equally interested in BST for the similar reasons as Fifteen. The Freedom Key, as it was sometimes called, was established as the prime agenda of the Labyrinth Group, and the Corteum and Fifteen were its initial members.

""Over the next several years, Fifteen selected the cream of the crop from the scientific core of the ACIO to undergo a similar intelligence accelerator program as he had, with the intention of developing a group of scientists that could -- in cooperation with the Corteum -- successfully invent BST. The ACIO, in the opinion of Fifteen, was too controlled by the NSA and he felt the NSA was too immature in its leadership to responsibly deploy the technologies that he knew would be developed as an outgrowth of the Labyrinth Group. So Fifteen essentially plotted to take over the ACIO and was assisted by his new recruits to do so.

""This happened a few years before I became affiliated with the ACIO as a student and intern. My stepfather was very sympathetic to Fifteen's agenda and was helpful in placing Fifteen as the Executive Director of the ACIO. There was a period of instability when this transition occured [occurred], but after about a year, Fifteen was firmly in control of the agendas of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group.

""What I said earlier . . . [--] that he was viewed as the CEO of the planet . . . [--] that's essentially who he is. And of the ETs who are interacting with humankind, only the Corteum understand the role of Fifteen. He has a vision that is unique in that it is a blueprint for the creation of BST, and is closing in on the right technological and human elements that will make this possible.""

Anne: ""What makes BST such an imperative to Fifteen and the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""The ACIO has access to many ancient texts that contain prophecies of the earth. These have been accumulated over the past several hundred years through our network of secret organizations of which we are a part. These ancient texts are not known in academic institutions, the media, or mainstream society; they are quite powerful in their depictions of the 21st [twenty-first] century. Fifteen was made aware of these texts early on when he became Director of Research for the ACIO, and this knowledge only fueled his desire to develop BST.""

Anne: ""What were these prophecies and who made them?""

Dr. Anderson: ""The prophecies were made by a variety of people who are, for the most part, unknown or anonymous, so if I told you their names you would have no recognition. You see, time travel can be accomplished by the soul from an observational level . . . [--] that is to say, that certain individuals can move in the realm of what we call vertical time and see future events with great clarity, but they are powerless to change them. There are also those individuals who have, in our opinion, come into contact with the WingMakers and are provided messages about the future, which they had recorded in symbol pictures or extinct languages like Sumerian, Mayan, and Chakobsan.

""The messages or prophecies that they made had several consistent strands or themes that were to occur in the early part of the 21st [twenty-first] century, around the year 2011. Chief among these was the infiltration of the major governments of the world, including the United Nations, by an alien race. This alien race was a predator race with extremely sophisticated technologies that enabled them to integrate with the human species. That is to say, they could pose as humanoids, but they were truly a blend of human and android

How about this?

(July 30, 2019)

The WingMakers aka Cosmic Central Race


The Cosmic Central Race has been in the spheres around planet Earth for some months now. They have already made contact with various Key Lightworkers on the surface and can also be contacted at any time in meditations. The Wingmakers in their non-physical form usually appear gigantically large in brightly shining silhouettes. But they can also turn into giant spheres that can actually serve as spaceships too. Sometimes they also seem to have a kind of beak, which is why they are often portrayed as birds or eagles.

The eagle can actually be regarded as the representative animal of the Central Cosmic Race, since it is completely free, stands above things and overlooks everything. This is also the reason, why the Native Americans worshipped the eagle and often wore feather decoration as headgear.

Two centuries ago, it was also the last time that the Wingmakers actively appeared as Walk-ins on the surface of the planet. Because of the fact that many positive indigenous tribes were so pure, the CCR were able to go into the avatars of a few lightful female and male shamans for a short time and thus could provide important knowledge to the people.

However, the Archons separated this connection by triggering the extermination of those tribes through the colonization of America, so that the CCR no longer had clean vessels available on the ground.




As with many other symbols (Swastika, All-Seeing Eye) the Dark Ones have also taken the symbol of the CCR, the eagle, and have attached it to their own flags. This is also the reason why many royal houses or nations have a one or double-headed eagle on their emblems (or see the Roman Aquila or the Imperial eagle of the Nazis). It’s all about appropriation of the radiant power of originally positive symbolism, because the Dark Ones have nothing comparable of their own.

But now, after a long journey from the Center of the Galaxy,

 the “real” eagles are back and about to land.              <-----------

 And that means that the end of the Quarantine is approaching, because the CCR is energetically superior to the Chimera, comparable with a real eagle in the sky to a spider on the ground ... the Chimera fears the CCR.

Tolkien also referred to the Wingmakers, in form of the eagles which appear whenever the situation is most hopeless:

The most visible operation of the Light Forces is probably the Epstein case, which will crack the protective wall of the Cabal around the global paedophile system and will mark the beginning of a subsequent chain reaction of (worrisome) disclosures that will at some point end in the collapse of the matrix.

After the resignation of the English Prime Minister, you can also see further physical effects of the energetic liberation of the British Isles, by the publication that parts of the English (Fake) Royal Family are also involved in the Epstein case, which will at some point lead to their demise too...(and it continues https://fm144.blogspot.com)

Instead, I keep coming back to ""glitches"" and ""reality shifts"" and why this would be occurring to so many people I know as well.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/its-looking-extremely-likely-that-qanon-is-probably-a

Last month, an Italian leftist activist collective called the Wu Ming Foundation pointed to a book they published in the ’90s that is shockingly similar to QAnon.

In 1999, Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi, and Luca Di Meo, writing under the name ""Luther Blissett,"" published an Italian novel called Q.

Luther Blissett was a name regularly adopted in the ’90s by leftists, anarchists, and general troublemakers in Italy. It was used for staging all kinds of pranks. The Luther Blissetts in different cities would occasionally communicate by phone, but for the most part the project just spread organically. Think of it like an analogue Guy Fawkes Anonymous mask.

Three of the authors behind Luther Blissett — Bui, Cattabriga, and Guglielmi — told BuzzFeed News that the Blissett project was ""a network of activists, artists and cultural agitators who all shared the name 'Luther Blissett.'""

They now operate under the name ""Wu Ming"" or ""No Name.""

The plot of their novel Q is pretty similar in structure to the basics of the QAnon conspiracy theory.

It follows the journey of an unnamed Anabaptist religious radical across Europe during the 16th century. He joins various movements that emerge following the Protestant Reformation. The whole time he's being pursued by a spy for the Roman Catholic Church named Q.

The book sparked all kinds of debates about what it's actually about, but its authors said it was meant to be autobiographical. ""We often described it as 'playbook,' an 'operations manual' for cultural disruption,"" they said.

Basically, Q is a handbook for activists who want to disrupt society.

So, let's break this down. What are the similarities between an Italian novel from the ’90s and the QAnon conspiracy theory that's resulting in armed standoffs with police in the US?

""Coincidences are hard to ignore,"" Bui, Cattabriga, and Guglielmi said. ""Dispatches signed 'Q' allegedly coming from some dark meanders of top state power, exactly like in our book.""

They also pointed to the fact that the Q from the QAnon community is described almost exactly like Luther Blissett used to be described, ""an entity of about 10 people that have high security clearance.""

One of the most popular theories in the QAnon community is that John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his own death in 1999 and became QAnon, which is also the year Q was first published.

""We can't say for sure that it's an homage,"" they said. ""But one thing is almost certain: our book has something to do with it. It may have started as some sort of, er, 'fan fiction' inspired by our novel, and then quickly became something else.""

Ironically, it seems that even QAnon followers have noticed the similarities. A user last month highlighted the book, calling it ""an old Q.""",conspiracy,QAnon
107,Have any of you even considered the possibility that QAnon may very well be a United States military intelligence operation?,112.0,k7md99,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k7md99/have_any_of_you_even_considered_the_possibility/,116.0,1607226634.0,"Think about it logically.

Trump decides randomly one day to run for president. 

Then Trump wins.

Then this mysterious ""Q"" poster, claiming to be military intelligence, comes out of no where and starts leading people down a rabbit hole suggesting the world is essentially run by a cabal of pedophiles.

Q says this is no longer Republican vs Democrat.

Q suggests one of the reasons Trump ran is because he couldn't stomach the thought of mass murders occurring to satisfy **Moloch**.

Q says many in our government worship **Satan**.

Q said secret space programs exist outside of the public view.

Q said ""No"" when asked if we were ""alone"" and said ""think of the vastness of space"".

Now, if Q really is military intel, and Trump is working with the military to fight this ""deep state"", and there really is this shadow war being raged, then it's logical the enemy will fight back try and stop Trump from dismantling their cabal. 

So let's see what Trumps opponents have done:

~ They spied on his presidential campaign

~ They spied on his presidency

~ They tried to frame him with Russian collusion

~ They tried to impeach him over a perfect phone call

~ They unleashed a virus to hurt his chance at reelection and to help flood mail in ballots used for fraud and to cause maximum chaos

~ They are currently quite literally trying to steal the election from him



And despite all that, Trump is still pushing through and fighting for we the people.

There are now TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE aware of the ""conspiracy world"" and all the things surrounding ""the cabal"" or ""deep state"".

WHY WOULD THE BAD GUYS EVER ALLOW THIS MANY PEOPLE TO AWAKEN?

Unless they didn't want this to happen because Q is military, Patriots are in control and nothing can stop what's coming?

For decades, the world has questioned the space exploration narrative propounded by NASA. While this is not widely known, NASA is essentially a military organization, which means that this agency could protect sensitive information under the guise of defending national security. While the evidence seems to suggest that NASA did indeed send human beings to the Moon, many of the pictures taken on the Moon are said to have been faked or altered, and NASA has also altered images and video taken from the ISS.

In 2002, [Gary McKinnon hacked into NASA’s computer systems](https://www.wired.com/2006/06/ufo-hacker-tells-what-he-found/), and the data that he found seems to corroborate the supposition that this government agency is hiding information from the public.  McKinnon uncovered pictures of UFOs that had been edited out of satellite imagery, flight manifests for spacecraft that didn’t officially exist, and lists of military officers involved in extraterrestrial operations. Buzz Aldrin, one of the first men on the Moon, has reported encountering an L-shaped UFO, and this space veteran also drew attention to an artificially constructed monolith on Mars’s moon Phobos during a startling C-SPAN interview.

On multiple nights in the summer of 1952, dozens of UFOs circled over the Capitol Building in Washington, DC. Who piloted these craft, who hid the information that Gary McKinnon found, and who put that monolith on Phobos? There’s a mystery here waiting to be discovered, and in the following list, we will explore some of the purported secret space programs whose personnel may hold the answers.

**10. Solar Warden**

When Gary McKinnon hacked into NASA’s hard drives, some of the information he found was related to a black budget program known as [Solar Warden](https://archive.fo/zsnN5). This program supposedly came into existence in tandem with the “Star Wars” space defense initiative, and McKinnon came across information that seemed to indicate that the operation consisted of eight enormous motherships and approximately 40 smaller vessels.

Supposed secret space program insider William Tompkins claims to have helped develop the vessels used in the Solar Warden fleet. Tompkins was apparently inducted into classified aerospace think tanks before he even graduated high school, due to his stunning proficiency at building models of naval ships. Throughout his career, Tompkins received telepathic information, including blueprints, from benevolent extraterrestrials who wanted us to be able to defend ourselves.

According to the independent testimony of multiple insiders, a treaty was made in the 1950s between malevolent ETs, represented by breakaway Nazis, and the Eisenhower administration. In exchange for live human subjects to use for biological materials, these aliens would guarantee the military supremacy of the United States. Strict quotas were set to ensure that only a small number of humans would be abducted. It quickly became apparent, however, that the ETs were not sticking to their end of the bargain.

Solar Warden was developed as a form of interplanetary border control to stop malevolent aliens from stealing more humans than they were allotted. Developed in the 1960s and 1970s and deployed in 1980, Solar Warden is one of earliest secret space programs. As international corporate interests became aware of the potential profits available from interacting with ETs, however, another program was soon developed.

**9. Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC)**

Lockheed’s “Skunk Works” division has a penchant for secrecy. The existence of the F-117A stealth fighter was kept secret for nearly ten years until the eve of the Gulf War. Though the existence of the SR-71 Blackbird is well-known, insider Edgar Rothschild Fouche claims that Lockheed has developed secret planes all the way up to SR-75. Some of these aircraft are apparently capable of speeds in excess of Mach 10.

Various insiders claim that Skunk Works has also made spacecraft capable of reaching other worlds. These witnesses to the secret space programs claim that Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, and various non-aerospace corporations all joined together to form an organization called the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC). While the purpose of Solar Warden is the defense of the solar system, [the objective of the ICC is trade](https://www.exopolitics.org/secret-space-programs-more-complex-than-previously-revealed/). 

According to secret space program insider Corey Goode, the ICC does trade from their bases on Mars with over 900 extraterrestrial species. Apparently, human beings have a knack for engineering that is valuable to other species that have reached a level of development roughly comparable to our own. These Mars bases are staffed by slaves who were taken from Earth in the 1970s and 1980s, and many of these slaves have now had children who are doomed to a life of abject servitude.

In 2015, the British Interplanetary Society (BIS) held a distinctly odd meeting. Charles Cockell, the event organizer, led his fellow society members in a thought experiment to determine how best to depose a ruthless dictator of a Martian colony. Coincidentally, this event was held within days of Goode revealing the existence of a slave colony on Mars.

Since there are ostensibly no human colonies on Mars to date, it would seem that the BIS should be more concerned with methods for getting human beings to the Red Planet than they should with the potential socioeconomic ramifications of establishing a colony that doesn’t officially exist. Do these British elites know something that we don’t, or are they just incredibly thorough contingency planners?

**8. German Breakaway Civilization**

In the early 1930s, German occultist Maria Orsic allegedly contacted extraterrestrials while in a trance state. Orsic was a member of the Vril Society, which itself was an offshoot of the [Thule Society](https://www.gaia.com/article/maria-orsic-vril-ufos-nazi-germany-secrets). Both groups were involved in investigating the origins of the Aryan race, and Orsic supposedly received information on how to build an interstellar spaceship from extraterrestrials from Aldebaran, who claimed to be the progenitors of the Aryans.

While Hitler believed that the Black Sun Society, a group controlled by the SS, had thoroughly infiltrated the Vril and Thule societies, it appears that Orsic had plans other than giving up control of her spacefaring capabilities to the warlike Third Reich. Orsic and her entire group disappeared without a trace in the final days of World War II, leading the occultists that she left behind to believe that she had successfully made the trip to Aldebaran in the ship that the Vril Society had constructed.

The Nazis, however, had other plans in motion for achieving a permanent presence among the stars.

**7. Dark Fleet**

While the Vril Society was more interested in peaceful space exploration, the Third Reich had a mind only for conquest. According to over a dozen supposed secret space program insiders, these militaristic ambitions were helped along greatly when the Nazis made contact with an extraterrestrial group called the Draco sometime in the 1930s.

When discerning common threads among the varying testimonies given by mediums, contactees, and insiders, it can be established that the Draco are an interplanetary empire that originated in the vicinity of the Orion constellation. This empire is composed of a variety of different reptilian humanoid species, and the Draco are centrally controlled by a highly advanced artificial intelligence. According to secret space program lore, this artificial intelligence is from a different universe, and its sole purpose is to destroy and conquer all forms of biological life.

Various mediumistic channels, such as the creators of the Law of One book series, indicate that a basic blueprint of human life is encoded into the quantum framework of the galaxy itself. This prototype is transmitted to each star in the galaxy, and each star transmits this program to its planets. Therefore, humanoid life is the norm in at least our galaxy, and this basic “five-star” archetype takes hold in whichever form of life becomes dominant on a given planet.

The purpose of the artificial intelligence that has infested the Draco in the form of nanites is to pervert or invert this sacred image of advanced life that the Christian Bible refers to as the image of God. Secret space program insiders speculate that cultural depictions of the Devil and demons originate from unconscious or lore-based knowledge of the Draco, and the insider community believes that the Draco subsist on something called “loosh.”

“Loosh” is a spiritual energy that is released by humanoid life forms that experience negative emotions or physical pain. Therefore, the elite caste in societies that have been infiltrated by the Draco turn traitor against their own species in order to engineer panoptic prisons that keep their fellow beings enslaved, terrified, ill, and ignorant.

These misanthropic priorities made the Draco and the Nazis a perfect match. The Nazis sought spacefaring capabilities, and the Draco sought a new species to add to their interstellar army. The Draco Empire, though constantly besieged by benevolent extraterrestrials, spans a great deal of territory throughout the galaxy. The Dark Fleet, which is mainly composed of ethnic Germans, is used by the Draco to defend existing territory and conquer new planets in other star systems.

While the Dark Fleet apparently has a sizeable presence here in the Sol System, their main forces are deployed in distant regions of the galaxy, where they join other captured races in the perennial task of expanding the slave empire of beings that many on our world would consider to be demons.

**6. Project Moon Shadow**

According to alleged secret space program insider Randy Cramer, Project Moon Shadow was a MILAB program designed to train genetically augmented super soldiers. MILAB is a contraction of “military abduction,” and this term refers to a number of projects that were supposedly conducted to obtain and train assets, usually children, for the secret space programs.

Many of these projects assessed the eligibility of sensitive individuals for work as intuitive empaths, which is a position that involves interfacing with extraterrestrials who have evolved beyond the need for vocal utterances. Usually, these naturally born empaths were identified from a distance using reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology.

The developers of Project Moon Shadow, however, genetically engineered embryos from the ground up that were then implanted into unwitting female hosts. These children would be born and live a few normal years before being brought aboard secret space program craft in the dead of night. They would then be flown to the Moon where they would participate in training exercises designed to bring out their latent abilities.

In sharp contrast to other MILAB programs, the training provided in Project Moon Shadow did not involve traumatizing experiences. According to Cramer, Project Moon Shadow consisted of 300 boys and girls who were trained in strategy, agility, and strength. Later, these genetically engineered child soldiers were given live weapons and trained alongside bemused adults.

According to the testimony of insiders such as Corey Goode and Tony Rodriguez, other MILAB programs exposed children to the absolute depths of horror. Children were raped and murdered in front of other children, MILAB participants were put into virtual reality scenarios in which they were pitted against monsters and forced to fight for their lives, and a general worship of occult practices was prevalent. Cramer was spared this hell, but he would soon find himself in a situation nearly as merciless.

**5. Mars Defense Force**

After his training, Cramer was apparently inducted into a military organization known as the Mars Defense Force (MDF). The MDF was a joint operation created by a number of different Earth governments to guard five burgeoning colonies on Mars. Cramer recollects visiting Aries Prime, which was the first colony built on the Red Planet. He describes this colony as containing a full Earthlike ecosystem complete with farmers, engineers, and bureaucrats.

Cramer reportedly defended these bases from indigenous Martians and other extraterrestrial species. He completed a 17-year tour of duty on Mars before he was reassigned to the Moon for his remaining three years of service.

Like other secret space program assets, Cramer alleges that he was involved in a so-called “20-and-back,” which is a 20-year term of service that each participant agrees to with a litany of consent forms. At the end of this obligation, 20-and-back assets are memory-wiped and age-regressed back to the age they were when they entered the program. They are then sent back in time to a point within minutes of their original date of departure. According to various insiders, only two to five percent of 20-and-back participants ever regain their memories.

**4. Global Galactic League Of Nations**

It is widely believed in the insider community that the Roswell UFO Incident was indeed an instance of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. American aerospace contractors and the Nazi scientists involved in Operation Paperclip were tasked with reverse-engineering this craft to produce usable technology. The craft that have been reproduced from the Roswell crash and other similar incidents are known as alien reproduction vehicles (ARVs). The TR-3B is an example of a commonly sighted ARV.

The United States, however, wasn’t the only superpower to find the wreckage of alien craft. According to insider lore, much of the information received by the American military-industrial complex regarding UFOs was transmitted by captured Nazi assets who had helped reverse-engineer ancient Vimana craft that the Vril and Thule societies had found in the Himalayas. These reproduction Vimanas had been operational since the 1930s, giving German scientists a leg up in the UFO game that made them into hotly contested prizes at the end of World War II.

However, the Soviets didn’t need German scientists to tell them all the secrets of extraterrestrial craft. According to various insiders, Stalin found a crashed ship of his own in Siberia that he tasked Soviet scientists to reverse engineer. The result of this initiative was a craft called the [Cosmosphere](https://spherebeingalliance.com/blog/transcript-cosmic-disclosure-global-galactic-league-of-nations.html), which caught the attention of American military assets in the early 1950s.

The presence of these one-to three-man flying silver spheres in the skies as the Americans were getting their own fledgling secret space program off the ground ultimately led to the formation of the Global Galactic League of Nations. Russia, China, the United States, and Germany were the core members of this group, but other nations were given token membership in exchange for keeping quiet about the UFO phenomenon. Member nations also agreed to hand over any crashed UFOs to the American or Soviet governments.

According to secret space program insiders, American and Russian assets worked together throughout the entirety of the Cold War despite the narrative that was sold to the masses, and the superpowers of the world continue to collaborate on secret space program agenda items with no concern given to the theatrics regularly employed to keep the people of the world entertained and distracted.

**3. Earth Alliance**

Various insiders have revealed that highly sensitive information pertaining to extraterrestrials and the secret space programs is habitually disclosed in the form of fiction. In this way, the social engineers who have erected this monumental lie are able to accuse anyone who comes forward with the truth as misconstruing fiction with reality or stealing their ideas from TV shows. Plus, it’s true that reality is stranger than fiction, and strangeness sells.

It appears this obfuscatory tactic was undertaken to cover the tracks of the Earth Alliance. In the television show Babylon 5, the Earth Alliance is an open confederation of human governments that was formed to protect the planet. According to insider lore, the real Earth Alliance serves a similar function, but its actions are accomplished sub rosa.

The Earth Alliance arose in opposition to what most insiders call the Cabal. This name was chosen because the members of the Cabal prefer to call themselves the Illuminati, which means the “illuminated ones.” According to the Earth Alliance, however, this group is not illuminated at all and has in fact been responsible for casting the denizens of our planet into a dark pit of disease, war, political disenfranchisement, civic unawareness, and wage slavery. The Cabal has been controlled by the Draco for centuries, and it is this alliance that is responsible for the commonly made connection between occult practices and “Devil worship.”

The Earth Alliance has been working in the shadows to undo the Cabal’s efforts to plunge humanity into an eternal darkness of massive depopulation and open technocratic rule. Members of the Earth Alliance have infiltrated the militaries of the United States, China, Russia, and other countries, and insider Corey Goode has unequivocally stated that the Earth Alliance has supported President Donald Trump since the beginning of his candidacy.

Bestselling author Jerome Corsi has expanded on this point by relaying that factions in the US military recruited Donald Trump to run for president of the United States with their assurances that any efforts to rig the election would be nullified. This position has been confirmed by the anonymous intel source “QAnon” that many believe to be comprised of the same members of military intelligence that got Trump elected.

As soon as Donald Trump was elected president, the Earth Alliance began operations across the globe designed to root out and destroy Cabal influence once and for all. USMC troops flooded into underground facilities hidden below FEMA camps and eliminated Draco operatives. A secret military tribunal was established, and over 25,000 sealed indictments have been filed at PACER.gov since October 2017.

The Earth Alliance showed its true strength when a small fleet of Dark Fleet craft attempted to leave the planet from their hiding place in Antarctica. Before this event, no one knew that the Earth Alliance had developed their own secret space program, but apparently a fleet of fighter-size spacecraft appeared from nowhere and inflicted critical damage on the fleeing Dark Fleet ships. As the Earth Alliance continues to perform operations on and below the Earth’s surface to free mankind from Cabal and Draco rule, it seems that they have also been inducted into the brotherhood of the secret space programs.

**2. Military Industrial Complex Secret Space Program**

While the members of the Earth Alliance, the Global Galactic League of Nations, and even the Cabal all agree that the secrets of the clandestine space programs, extraterrestrial contact, and suppressed technologies should be disclosed to the people of the world, there is some contention over how this feat should be accomplished.

The Cabal wants to release this information over the course of generations. They are attempting to gradually engineer global society into a state in which this sort of revelation would only cement the role of the Cabal as absolute and eternal overlords over mankind. The Earth Alliance wants full disclosure to occur now so that humanity can reap the benefits of free or zero-point energy, superluminal spaceflight, and advanced medical technologies, but they are fully aware that such a divulgence would entirely crash the current global economic system and engender total worldwide chaos until a new order could be established.

The Earth Alliance and the Cabal both intend to use a third faction known as the Military Industrial Complex Secret Space Program (MIC SSP) as a stepping stone toward full disclosure. On page 334 of The Reagan Diaries, it is revealed that President Reagan had been briefed on June 11, 1985, on the American space program’s capability of putting 300 people in orbit. It goes without saying that such a figure would be ludicrous to consider even today on the basis of publicly revealed information.

However, it appears that black budget programs within the Air Force have been developing clandestine aerospace vehicles for at least the last 30 years. According to various insiders, films like The Avengers series have served as orchestrated facets in the effort to gradually acclimate the public to the existence of suppressed technology. This practice of seeding hidden truths into mass media productions is called predictive programming, and it is also apparently used by the Cabal to hijack our co-creative consciousness to bring about deleterious situations.

Even the most elevated members of the MIC SSP have no idea what is truly going on in the cosmos. They have limited bases on the Moon, Mars, and in Earth orbit, but they have no contact with extraterrestrials and believe that their level of knowledge is the absolute truth. It is believed that releasing information on clandestine aircraft such as the TR-3B and flying aircraft carriers could prime the public for further disclosures of a more expansive nature.

The Cabal also intends to ignite this disclosure process if they ever feel their rule to be severely threatened, which has led many to believe that recent disclosure efforts enacted by Tom DeLonge and various high-level aerospace and military personnel have been a front for the psychological warfare operations of an increasingly cornered Cabal.

**1. Secret Space Program Alliance**

According to numerous secret space program insiders, the Earth Alliance has a counterpart beyond the terrestrial sphere. This organization is known as the Secret Space Program Alliance (SSP Alliance), and it is comprised of a variety of constituent members such as Solar Warden, the ICC, and the Global Galactic League of Nations. Though the SSP Alliance is composed almost entirely of members that spend most of their time off-planet, this organization is still highly involved in Earthly affairs.

The SSP Alliance represents the top of the totem pole in the secret space program hierarchy. This group has been afforded a seat at the so-called Super Federation, which is composed of over 60 extraterrestrial species that have been conducting experiments on Earth’s human, animal, and plant life. The SSP Alliance has also made contact with the Galactic Federation, which is composed of hundreds of different [benevolent extraterrestrial races](https://www.exopolitics.org/the-coming-solar-flash-the-galactic-federation-qa-with-corey-goode/).

This organization has also had contact with a society of hyper-advanced human beings who live under the Earth’s surface in vast climate-controlled chambers capable of supporting human life. This society is composed of multiple groups that have branched off from the natural development of human life on Earth, and the lead group, known as the Anshar, claim to have traveled back in time from our future in order to maintain an ideal timeline.

The SSP Alliance essentially holds the reins of the various benevolent secret space programs that operate in and around the Sol System. This group desperately wants humanity to gain access to information and technologies that have been hidden by the Cabal, and many within the SSP Alliance are actively preparing mankind to ride the wave of enhanced consciousness that these societal changes will bring.

Though belief systems regarding this event vary within the SSP Alliance. Most members believe that an upcoming electromagnetic shift in solar dynamics will actuate a quantum leap in human awareness. It is widely believed that the latent talents inherent to human consciousness have been willfully suppressed by malign actors, and the members of the SSP Alliance have united to sweep away this vestigial husk of corruption and usher in a new golden age for all of mankind.

I have compiled a list of some “theories” and subjects that I feel are intentionally pushed within this culture, to discredit us and to lead us down dead ends. Obviously, I am not 100% on any of these, but I’ve observed their effect on this culture and the public’s reaction to them, and I have found them to be either;

-Lacking entirely in any concrete evidence 
-Detrimental to the image of the conspiracy community  
-Intentionally confusing or appearing as a smokescreen
-Divisive and disruptive

-“Birds aren’t real”

I’ve seen this one recently and I really have a hard time believing this developed organically without a “push” from an outside influence. 

-Flat Earth

I just recently made I post about this, expressing my opinion that flat earth is a psyop used to conflate all conspiracists and truth seekers with insane people who neglect basic scientific beliefs and principles that the majority of the population agrees upon 

-Reptilians 

As an archetype or a historical/biblical reference, I have no problem with the reptilian theory. But the notion that the “elites” consist of a group of gigantic shapeshifting lizards seemed a bit far fetched. Has there ever been any evidence to support this theory? It has a similar effect as flat earth. The general public catches wind of the reptilian concept, (which seems to be largely the work of David Icke) and they may assume that the entire conspiracy culture endorses this belief. 

-Qanon and “the storm”

I’ve long suspected this to be a project of the intelligence agencies, who are coordinating with the current administration to create a “cult like” following for the president, and infuse a partisan bias within the conspiracy culture and the truth movement. Shaky “evidence”, partisan bias, and the use of cold reading techniques reek of a pacification psyop used to confuse and divide the community, whilst simultaneously getting them to invest hope and faith in the current government. 

-The jews rule the world 

You can cite examples of Jewish influence in the media, in our financial institutions, and even in politics, but it’s intellectually dishonest to point the finger entirely at one race and ethnic group of people. Perhaps not a psyop, but a dangerous belief to adhere IMO.

There are a few potential gatekeepers id like to toss into this write up as well. I’m interested in your opinions on all of these.

-Alex Jones

Seemed to replace Bill Cooper as the next “conspiracy messiah”, he too infuses a partisan right bias and support for the current administration in his often incoherent and outlandish ramblings. Having admitted to CIA family ties, I sometimes suspect he is a “plant” that is weaponized against the culture, with the purpose of gate keeping, disinformation, and destroying the credibility of the culture with his antics. 

-Joe Rogan

Rogan I believe was once genuine. I believe he was recently compromised and is now used as a gatekeeper, steering away certain topics from being discussed on his platform. The current Rogan is a far cry from the Rogan I listened to years ago. With his podcast being one of the most popular, it’s not crazy to assume he was approached by somebody and is now coached on how to conduct himself.

Like I said, I’m open to opinions and suggestions, but this is the list I have for now. If I had more time, I’d have a more complete list. ",conspiracy,QAnon

#####Do You Smell What I Smell?    

>Phantosmia is the medical word used by doctors when a person smells something that is not actually there.    
Phantosmia is also called a phantom smell or an olfactory hallucination. 
Problems with the nose, such as sinusitis, or conditions of the nervous system or brain, including migraine, stroke, or schizophrenia can cause phantosmia.     
Phantosmia is relatively uncommon. It makes up around 10 to 20 percent of disorders related to the sense of smell. In most cases, phantosmia is not a cause for concern and will go away on its own.
However, phantosmia can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, so people should always discuss this symptom with their doctor.
Some phantom smells are pleasant, but people with phantosmia more often describe unpleasant, foul, or disgusting odors. These may include: burnt toast • burning rubber • cigarette smoke • a chemical or metallic smell • a spoiled or rotting smell • a stale or moldy smell.    
People are often unable to identify the specific smell, or it may be a smell that they have never encountered before.
Phantosmia can feel distressing and may get in the way of daily life. It can influence a person’s sense of taste, leading to a reduced appetite and weight loss. [Source Here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322698)      

It's a rare condition. Cool. It only affects 10 to 20 of disorders relating to smell. Maybe that's what's happening worldwide, phantom smell syndrome.

Phantosmia odours are often foul; some people smell faeces or sewage, others describe smelling smoke or chemicals. These episodes can be sparked by a loud noise or change in the flow of air entering your nostrils. [Source Here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/smell-hallucination-phantom-phantosmia-suicidal-surgery-health-a8568141.html/)    



And there are more results. A lot more. It started in 2018 and hasn't really stopped. But phantom smells aren't enough these days, not at all. Now we need mass hysteria and mass psychogenic delusions as well.    

I know that a lot is happening in 2020, and it's hard to see what's happening, let alone remember what's happened, but our governments remember. Trust me, they do. And they definitely remember the hum/mechanical noise/frost quakes/sky quakes/sky trumpets.   

 When I started digging deeper into the sky trumpets I quickly realized that it's been reported on far longer than I had realized. Videos exist. Journalists have reported on it. Scientists are trying to find the reason behind it. It's real. It exists. 
 

But apparently not.    


>**January 06, 2019** • But increasingly, people all over the world report being sickened by persistent humming sounds. The Taos Hum, heard by thousands, has long plagued areas of New Mexico. In the late 1990s, the Kokomo Hum caused more than 100 people in Indiana to suffer headaches, light-headedness, muscle and joint pain, insomnia, fatigue, nosebleeds, and diarrhea. (A firm hired to investigate the mystery left the cause, as with so many cases of **psychological contagion**, as a mystery.) Canadians in Ontario now worry about the Windsor Hum. A Web site called the World Hum Map has identified some 7,000 locations around the world, searchable in the “World Hum Sufferers Database.”     

But it's not real. It's a psychological contagion. It's all in your head. I'm not crazy, you're crazy!  Message not accepted, so let's keep going. The hum/Sky Trumpets have been blamed on Frost Quakes, factories, bridges, airplanes, and other assorted phenomenon. The military has investigated. Scientists have researched it. We have digital recordings of it. But nope. Not real. 


>According to ProPublica, Patient Zero informed Ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, in a telling phrase, that “the rumor mill is going mad.” So a meeting was called, which spread the word even further. Over the next weeks and months, more than 80 staffers and their families came forward to complain of a dizzying and seemingly unrelated range of symptoms: deafness, memory loss, mental stupor, head pain. Many reported hearing the strange noise, but they couldn’t seem to agree on what it sounded like. One described it as “grinding metal,” and another called it a “loud ringing.” Yet another compared it to feeling the “air ‘baffling’ inside a moving car with the windows partially rolled down.” [Source Here](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-real-story-behind-the-havana-embassy-mystery)           


Now the Havana Embassy attacks in 2018 weren't real. I'm not crazy, you're crazy. Stop spreading fake news. But you'll easily notice that the Havana 'Sonic Attacks' were also accompanied with grinding metal and loud ringing, plus air baffling window partially rolled down sounds. Kinda like this?    


Sky Trumpets. [YouTube Link.](https://youtu.be/tgJgOS45QQQ)       


And when you search further, the videos don't stop. The entire world is suffering from psychological mass delusions! We need psychologists immediately! All of them. These people need help! And pills. Lots and lots of pills.  /S-SMH.      


So the rotten egg smell isn't real. The hum/Sky Trumpets aren't real (and I will mention that I personally know now one person in the hum article who is quoted. Not very well, but we have talked in the past. And he never struck me as a hoax/internet prankster. Just the opposite. So he's either imagining it, or it's real, and he definitely doesn't seem to be suffering mentally in any other area of his life, so I'll trust his judgment on the phenomenon). Only the nation state sanctioned narrative is real.      


So what else isn't real? Glad you asked.    


#####Close Encounter of the Drone Kind.

>**Jan. 29, 2020** · The mysterious drone sightings that captured national attention were a classic case of mass hysteria. [Source Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=mass+hallucinations+drone+sightings&oq=mass+hallucinations+drone+sightings&aqs=chrome..69i57.14076j0j4&client=ms-android-samsung-ss&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#ip=1)      

>**January 16, 2019** • Drone paranoia has us seeing things in the sky that aren't there. | Our current era is marked, like the Cold War, by political turmoil and deep-seated anxiety with technology. Perhaps these drone sightings are just a product of the unpleasant times that we live in, a manifestation of our fears. And drones, like flying saucers, are a rather concrete thing to be afraid of, a less abstract source of technological fright than subtle social media influence campaigns, or never-turned off tracking via our mobile phones. We’re frightened by the idea of drones spying on us, obstructing our travel, or even dropping explosives on our heads. We’re surrounded by news reports of attempted attacks with small drones by terrorists in Venezuela and in the Middle East, airport obstruction incidents like those at Gatwick and Heathrow, and general stories of people doing profoundly dumb and dangerous things with drones. [Source Here](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/drone-paranoia-gatwick-heathrow-airport-sightings-ufos.html)      


There are a ton of articles out there trying to dismiss the drone sightings. But is there one that's trying to dismiss the dismissals of drone sightings?     


>**2020** • As an expert on this topic, I can categorically conclude that whatever the trigger for these sightings is, it is **not mass hysteria**. Commonly referred to in scientific circles as mass psychogenic illness, this term refers to the rapid spread of illness symptoms within what is typically a close-knit group. I am unaware of a single report involving people seeing drones and suddenly feeling unwell. Given the lack of concrete evidence for drones and the identification of several objects that were clearly not drones, there is a much more likely explanation: what sociologists refer to as **a collective delusion**. [Source Here](https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA618950240&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=10639330&p=AONE&sw=w&u=googlescholar&asid=ff59eed082478cce9e8cef53c074acf1&mg=true)        


Oh. So it's a collective delusion, not a mass psychogenic delusion. Phew. Thank goodness that was cleared up.     


>**November 14, 2015** • Past cases of MPI (Mass Psychogenic Illness) reveal women are more likely to be affected than men. It often starts with one individual. People are more affected if the first to fall is someone they know well, and if that person has a high status in the group. **A spate of cases in the US have seen cheerleaders faint and send others quickly to the floor**. Schools are particularly vulnerable. One of the most **potent environmental triggers is smell**, so anxiety can be heightened if someone posts rumours of a gas leak on Facebook, as happened during the **Outwood academy faintings**.     
“These things become huge when the rumour explanation is both dangerous and credible,” says Wessely. Evidence is plentiful, from the West Bank, Kosovo, **South Africa** and Afghanistan. In 2012, Takhar province in Afghanistan was alerted to what was feared to be a mass poisoning of girls at a school in the Taluqan district. **Some reported a bad smell**. They were dizzy, nauseous and weak. But doctors found no organic cause. The WHO put it down to MPI and said it was the fourth year it had happened. The girls feared the Taliban would poison them.

A bad smell that made school students sick. It's all in their head.        


>**June 27, 2018** • Families who have been living with a “**rotten egg**” smell around their homes have finally been told the problem will be resolved.
One affected resident, John Turner, 60, from Acklam contacted different agencies, including **Northumbrian Water and Middlesbrough** Council’s environmental health service, in order to find out where the smell was coming from.
Eventually, it was discovered that the stink, which is not constant, was coming from a septic tank at the nearby **Outwood Academy** Acklam, on Hall Drive.
John said: “It’s just been a nightmare. We just want closure. We just want it sorted. We just want to see the end of it really.” [Source Here](https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/rotten-egg-smell-made-living-14834753)

Wait. What?     

>**August 05, 2018** • Hot sewage has been blamed for some of the complaints of a “cat poop” smell blowing over Redcar .
Residents around the seaside town have been reporting a “disgusting” whiff - also described as “**terrible and sulphur-like**” - since Monday.
Many said the odour was strongest around the Coatham and Warrenby areas, with one social media poster claiming it was strongest around the “blast furnace site”, while another said it was coming from “out at sea”.
Reports of the stench led to a number of complaints to the Environment Agency which is investigating.
The public body has said it’s narrowed down one possible source to a **Northumbrian Water sewage treatment facility** - aggravated by recent hot weather.
But the agency stressed that not all the reports could be attributed to the site and added that the pong’s source had not been conclusively identified. [Source Here](https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/hot-sewage-gets-part-blame-14992267)

Hydrogen Sulfide is a flammable gas. It is also toxic. All of these areas are in close proximity. Are they all suffering from mass psychogenic illness? Seriously?  Worldwide rotten egg smell folks, and it's getting worse. And it's definitely not mass psychogenic illness or collective delusions.     


#####Doomscrolling      


So what happens when the events start spiraling out of control? When the facts can't be countered by reporting it as Fake News or Fake Facts? You come up with a new fake term to blame the individual instead of the masses, that's how.          


>**June 25, 2020** • Doomscrolling Is Slowly Eroding Your Mental Health. The act of doomscrolling, then, is to roll toward annihilation. [Source Here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling&ved=2ahUKEwiAnPHMuJjrAhX1oXIEHRP-BpkQFjAHegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw03g7kFEX-Jv2qjzWfYI59p)      
>>July 19, 2020** • Your 'Doomscrolling' Breeds Anxiety. Here's How To Stop The Cycle : ""Doomscrolling,"" has emerged as a new slang term to describe the practice of endlessly consuming doom-and-gloom news.

Doomscrolling? Huh. Ok. So asking questions and looking for answers when the answers provided don't add up, is Doomscrolling. And Doomscrolling adds to your anxiety, which causes you to smell phantom smells, hear noises that aren't there, and see drones that aren't there. Why it's so bad that it actually makes you hear the Sky Trumpets and see the Drones that aren't there on YouTube videos, as you sit at home and you Doomscroll, you apocalyptical porn freak!      


#####Conspiracy Theorists and Terrorists.     


If anything that I've written doesn't alarm you, than you better reread the post and change the framework that you're applying to the information. This isn't just attempting to discredit, it's setting up to criminalize the very notion of not accepting the narrative.    



>**July 31, 2020** • This is all possible because of how social media and search engines work.  This creates a data void, a vacuum of trustworthy information unpopulated by authoritative sources. Within a data void, search algorithms surface what's available rather than well-curated local, timely, and relevant content. This is the perfect condition for a viral infection of misinformation and conspiracism. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-dark-virality-of-a-hollywood-blood-harvesting-conspiracy/)        


Get it? If the news isn't from an authoritative source, it creates a data void, and conspiracy theories fill that data void. They don't fill in the blanks or ask questions, they provide Fake Facts and Fake News. 



>**August 12, 2020** • QAnon first surfaced in 2017 with a series of anonymous posts on the internet forum 4chan claiming to reveal high-level government intelligence about crimes by top Democrats. It has since spawned one of the most disturbing and consequential conspiracy theory communities in modern history. Its followers have committed serious crimes, and its online vigilantes have made a sport of harassing and doxxing their perceived enemies. **The F.B.I. has cited QAnon as a potential domestic terror threat**, and social networks have begun trying to pull QAnon groups off their platforms. Dozens of QAnon-affiliated candidates are running for office this year. One of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene, won a primary runoff Tuesday for a House seat in Georgia, drawing a congratulatory tweet from Mr. Trump.

Coincidence that they all came out three weeks ago?    


>**John Oliver on coronavirus conspiracy theories: ‘People are going to get burned’.   
The Last Week Tonight host dissects the allure of conspiracy theories, and the particular risk they pose during the pandemic**; “The only difference now is that our current pandemic is coming in the age of the internet, when it’s not only easier for people to do bad research and spread their results, but it’s also possible for them to make material look startlingly **authoritative**,” said Oliver.
“These theories can be innately appealing and, thanks to the internet, can spread with ease,” he added. “And all of this would be dangerous enough before you take into account that one of the most prominent spreaders of conspiracy theories on earth is the current **president of the United States**.” [Source Here](https://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/20/john-oliver-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-people-are-going-to-get-burned)         


And when did Oliver do the monolog? Three weeks ago. But don't worry about it, I'm just seeing a conspiracy about conspiracy theories. Right?  All of these articles that are designed to discredit questioning and foster division have suddenly and organically started without any effort to purposefully manipulate public opinion. Nope. Not even a chance. It's just a coincidence. Trust in the authorities and listen to their answers.    


Right? Wrong. 


Authoritative sources are valid and conspiracy theories look authoritative, so it confuses people who need authoritative explanations. And the more confusing the times, the more people look to authority to explain what's going on. And the more confused they become, the more trust they place in authoritative answers.    And yet the authorities don't actually provide explanations, only answers which provide comfort. Mass Psychogenic Illness isn't an explanation, it's an answer. Discrediting Conspiracy Theorists with blanket statements labeling them mentally ill are the masses security blankets to comfort them through the confusion. I'm not crazy, you're crazy. It's the modern day equivalent of the Salem Witch Trials. If you believe in Conspiracy Theories you're crazy, but if the Conspiracy later turns out to be true, everyone forgets that it was a Conspiracy Theory at one point. If you drown you're not a Witch, if you don't drown you're a Witch and you'll be put to death. If you drown in the main **STREAM** official narrative for the New Normal **CURRENT** events you're not mentally ill, but if you don't drown in the New Normal Narrative you're suffering from Mass Psychogenic Illness. But what they don't want you to remember is that the Salem Witch Trials were a result of Mass Hysteria by the masses, not the other way around. And that's why they don't want you finding the answers, because it provides people with another way around the official version of the New Normal narrative. And they've been building this New Normal narrative for a long time now. And the New Normal provides answers (This is our New Normal). It provides doubt (This isn't our New Normal). It provides confusion (Why this (probably isn't) our New Normal). This is what the New Normal is, a comforting answer to the masses, and an ominous message for the rest of us who dare to question the comforting feeling that the New Normal security blanket provides. We don't want answers, we want explanations. It's not unreasonable to expect a reasonable answer to explain what the New Normal is exactly. It's used to answer everything while explaining nothing. What's the matter? Nothing. And nothing isn't an answer for something. It never has been, and it never will be. And something is happening, and what's happening is happening whether you accept the New Normal or not. So what's been happening in our New Normal world?

It used to be just a couple of questions about fake news, maybe an occasional conspiracy theory after work, but he would never question fake facts, or so I thought.

Pick one. Join the herd. But haven't you heard, herd immunity is impossible in the New Normal pandemic. Because this pandemic isn't normal, it's New Normal. It doesn't come in waves like before, it's just one big continuous wave with no hope of herd immunity. So one vaccine won't work. You'll need annual vaccines. **Vacflix.

Don't laugh. Take this seriously. Remember, every regime that consolidates power needs an external and internal threat. We already have the external threats, Russia and China. Our governments have already blamed them for fake news, hacking, and sowing dissent in the Homelands. It's labeled as a psychological subversion to demoralize the populace, and bring down the enemy from within. And yes some of it is. Maybe most of it. Maybe all of it. It doesn't matter how much they are to blame when it comes to the fragmenting of our society, because the end result shall be the same in this Endgame: any questioning of the official New Normal Narrative will label you as a Conspiracy Theorist who's fallen prey to adversarial behavioral manipulation by foreign powers and designate you not as an enemy of the state, but an unfortunate victim of a foreign enemy's propoganda champaign. And you will need professional help for your mental health. In other words, your friends and family will subconsciously remember one term, even if they don't say it or even consciously realize it, you will personify the nomenclature of Useful Idiot. 

Don't be a useful idiot. They want you to be vocal. They want you to stand out. To be outspoken. To sound crazy. Unhinged. To be heard and ignored and labeled disturbed. And you won't disturb, let alone disrupt, the New Normal Narrative programming by sounding disturbed. So if that's true, is it hopeless? Not at all. You already have a blueprint, it's the blueprint being used against you. It's the New Normal Narrative script. All you need to do is flip the script. Don't provide answers, create doubt. Nobody likes to be told what's right and what's wrong, because it makes them feel stupid. You need to make them feel smart. Provide the doubt and let them find the answers so they'll feel smart. Bring up the reports of unexplained Covid-19 cases. Ask them what they think of the mysterious cases of hypoxia incidents before the pandemic, and then ask them their thoughts on Covid-19 and the ongoing unexplained hypoxia incidents. Point out how similar Basic Guaranteed Income is to the current stimulus payments, and then remark on the coincidence of the need to isolate and the upcoming robotic automation of factories. Ask them their thoughts on why Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening on farms and meat processing plants, but don't happen in other close quarter industries. Then perhaps end it by saying that you're going to start following Bill Gates investment strategy, because he seems to be in all the right industries for 2020. Let all that sink in and let their unconscious do the work for you. And most importantly, don't connect the dots, just let them fill in the blanks.   

This is the blueprint being used against you. This is the same blueprint that you need to follow. Fight fire with fire, and maybe they'll see the light. But don't do what they want you to do. Because most people can't be convinced by anyone, they have to convince themselves. All you have to is light the spark of doubt.

Mahler was on a motorboat on the way to his yacht in Sardinia where close friend Flavio Briatore (Briatore is Naomi Campbell’s ex-boyfriend and was photographed with Epstein victim Virginia Roberts several times -** [**https://www.the-sun.com/news/265368/prince-andrew-epstein-scandal-accuser-virginia-roberts-posts-chilling-message-aimed-at-naomi-campbell-and-ghislaine/**](https://www.the-sun.com/news/265368/prince-andrew-epstein-scandal-accuser-virginia-roberts-posts-chilling-message-aimed-at-naomi-campbell-and-ghislaine/)**) waited. On the way to the yacht, Mahler and the others on board struck and killed Alex Ciardi, wife of investment banker Giuseppe Ciardi. Turns out that Alex Ciardi worked with the NSPCC, a children’s charity that several others in Epstein’s ‘black book’ (Jemma Kidd, Tim Jeffries, Mary Glanville, Clare Hazell-Ivaegh, Ben Holland-Martin) and Princess Margaret have served. The accident occurred close to Silvio Berlusconi’s villa. Berlusconi is a billionaire businessman and four-time former Prime Minister of Italy who throws infamously raunchy Bunga Bunga parties.

Mandelson was introduced to Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell (they met through her father), who he has been friends with since the 1980s. He is also a very close friend of Prince Andrew. Mandelson is confirmed to have stayed on Epstein’s island and had dinner at Epstein’s NYC mansion with Donald Trump, David Blaine, and Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google (**[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7412517/Peter-Mandelson-Jeffrey-Epstein-Ex-Labour-minister-shopping-depraved-financier-2005.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7412517/Peter-Mandelson-Jeffrey-Epstein-Ex-Labour-minister-shopping-depraved-financier-2005.html)**).

He says that he suspected it was a ‘honey trap’ (**[**https://ericmargolis.com/2019/07/the-honey-trap-on-e-71st/**](https://ericmargolis.com/2019/07/the-honey-trap-on-e-71st/)**).**

The number of suspected pedophiles and child traffickers that are involved with the NSPCC is mindblowing. His ex-wife, Pia, is close friends with Allegra Hicks (**[**https://www.pressreader.com/uk/evening-standard-west-end-final-extra-es-homes-and-property/20080305/281767034925175**](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/evening-standard-west-end-final-extra-es-homes-and-property/20080305/281767034925175)**), who is also in Epstein’s book.**

Of course, he was eventually found to be innocent of these charges. Coincidentally, it seems as though Epstein target dancers at NYC studios, including one who was approached by an intermediary after ballet class (**[**https://www.pointemagazine.com/jeffrey-epstein-dancers-2640183763.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2**](https://www.pointemagazine.com/jeffrey-epstein-dancers-2640183763.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2)**).**

He was found days later, dead of a heroin overdose, in a sleazy hotel on the outskirts of town. Many conspiracies abound (including from his family) who believe he was murdered because he was found with a heroin needle and it was well known that he never injected (**[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1216159/The-drug-addict-friends-haunt-Trinny-Woodall.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1216159/The-drug-addict-friends-haunt-Trinny-Woodall.html)**).**

Federal Reserve is the problem. Unaccountable, 'inauditable' central banks are evil. They want you to be distracted by some right wing nuts or some left wing social justice warrior so you don't audit the fed or CIA. The sides are not different, go ask your favorite politician from red team and blue team. Both parties want to hang Julian Assange from the tallest building in the country and feed him to the vultures.

One of the move of a colonizer is to create the problem then prescribe a half -a$$ solution. Federal Reserve creates the problem, you can pretend to raise minimum wage and forgive student loans, but that's not addressing the real problem of neo-colonization.

It's kinda like Batman. Many superheroes create problems, specially Batman. Bruce Wayne is creating problem with Wayne Corp then pretending to solve that by wearing some capes. Gotham is fudged up because of Wayne Corp shareholders.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Both groups are being fooled by mainstream media and central banks. BLM is screaming Biden is going to give them healthcare and reduce police corruption.

Right wingers like Qanon is screaming that Trump is going to give them healthcare etc.

But nothing will change, nothing will fundamentally change. Both sides want to get funding from Federal Reserve and associates by signaling virtue. It's a religious ritual for them, to signal virtue to their left wing and right wing base.

If you don't think they are not signaling virtue like religious prayer, then why doesn't Biden or Trump run on a platform of auditing federal reserve? Identity politics is encouraged by Fed Res to divide the country.

Big tech wants to censor everybody in twitter not because of hate speech, because of federal reserve. They want to create an alternate reality where you will be blinded by censorship. You will end up thinking- hey nobody really wants to audit the fed or tax the rich, so maybe I am in the minority. But maybe you are not. Maybe your stance is popular but you are in a 'reality' that makes it seems nobody wants it. Manufactured consent.

Auditing the fed is not super-popular but it's not really unpopular either. If you ask people around- hey do you think there should be a bank that is in-auditable, like American exceptionalism, this bank should be in-auditable so it can be able to spread freedom and democracy? Most people will say- no, please audit all the banks.

Same for corporate campaign donations. If you ask, even the right wing prosperity gospel people will say hey corporate campaign donations are evil and stop it now. But if you are a Hillary Trump supporter, you will be oblivious to the reality. You will end up caring about the wrong issues and not the real issues. Identity politics is encouraged by Fed Res to divide the country.

Audit the fed, abolish CIA, end corporate campaign donations.

Else you will be eating each other, hunger games style. You will own nothing but you will be happy because you will end up being a satanist cannibal. Vision 2030.

We are bystanders mostly. The forces we are fighting are so entrenched that the owners of the petition sites, newspapers and doctors we trust are all in on it in some way or another.

Just do things you are in control of. Stop drinking fluoridated water. Buy a gun. Learn how to grow plants. Stop eating  crap processed foods and don't spend money on businesses and services you are unhappy with. 

Whatever you do. Don't say you are powerless. 

Don't force your new awakened knowledge on others (for your own sanity) wade slowly with family and friends. 

Its ok to break the law and not listen to the government. Just don't get caught. You are in more control than you think you are. 

Just get comfortable living on the outside. 

If a forced vaccine comes around. You know there will be a black market from doctors who will provide fake notes. Find them. Be happy. 

There is always a way.

ASHINGTON – As Henry Kissinger predicted soon after the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s “transition from being a campaigner to being a national strategist” has been seamless. Much like the change Barack Obama underwent in 2008, where “anti-establishment” campaign rhetoric and promises became a thing of the past and a “status quo” neoliberal/neoconservative agenda was adopted in its place, Trump’s transition has led to a resurgence of power and influence among Washington’s most notorious neoconservatives and a continuation of many of the policies that he had once railed against.

Trump’s decision to assume the mantle of George W. Bush should have angered his base, as his promises to “drain the swamp” of the nation’s capital ring ever-hollow amid the ascension of the worst of Washington’s cesspool to powerful positions in the Trump administration. However, such anger among Trump’s base has failed to materialize en masse. Instead, the anger has largely been diverted and redirected, thanks to an internet phenomenon known simply as “QAnon.”

QAnon began last October when an anonymous account began posting in the internet forum 4chan – and later the related forum 8chan — and claimed to be a well-positioned source in the Trump administration with “Q” level security clearance. Notably, Q emerged just as war with North Korea seemed imminent, coming just as Trump met with military leaders and warned that it was “the calm before the storm.” Q’s first posts were in direct reference to that statement, placed under a thread titled “Calm before the Storm,” and the mysterious figure’s subsequent posts are collectively known as “the Storm.” Qanon has been promoted by prominent figures on the Trump-supporting right like Sean Hannity, Roseanne Barr and Alex Jones, among others.

**Since the phenomenon began, the posts of the anonymous “Q” have engaged in the construction of a parallel reality — one where Robert Mueller is actually investigating Hillary and Bill Clinton; several other high-profile, corrupt Democrats will soon be shipped off to Guantanamo Bay; swamp monster John Bolton is actually “cleaning up” Washington; and Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has been “rescued” from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.**

**The reality constructed by QAnon has ultimately unfolded much like a fictitious spy novel, one that details a “secret” counter-coup by the Trump administration against the so-called “Deep State” that Trump – in reality — has dutifully served ever since winning the 2016 election. Despite QAnon’s having been proven wrong repeatedly, its following remains large and the phenomenon itself remains influential.**

Robert Martin, a documentary filmmaker whose series “A Very Heavy Agenda” delves into the nefarious political influence of the neoconservatives, told MintPress that **QAnon is the “perfect wish-fulfillment conspiracy snowball” aimed at conservatives, adding that it has worked to “rehabilitate some of the most tarnished and scary neocons to all of a sudden be heroic figures.” Among the figures who have been promoted by QAnon as heroes resisting the “deep state” include Blackwater founder Erik Prince, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Mayor of New York City turned Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.**

In fact, Martin asserted that QAnon appears to be an evolution of a proposal once put forth by Cass Sunstein, a close confidant of Barack Obama, **who had urged the government infiltration of anti-government and anti-establishment groups and, as Salon noted at the time, would manipulate such groups in order to increase citizens’ faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of “conspiracists.”**

Martin asserted that **QAnon has manifested as a means of “purposeful disinformation made to distract or control conspiracy movements,” going so far as to call for “military control” to stop the “deep state” all while being promoted by influential news organizations among Trump supporters at the behest of the White House.**

**Indeed, the White House specifically asked Alex Jones to have his Infowars Washington bureau chief, Jerome Corsi, report extensively on QAnon postings and interpret them for the Infowars audience. Since late last April, both Jones and Corsi have claimed that the Q account was “seized” by the “deep state” and is no longer credible. The times being what they are, however, QAnon still attracts tens of thousands of followers, many of whom have rejected Infowars in favor of QAnon posts.**

 

Pushing regime change in Iran

However, this past Tuesday, QAnon took a step in a new direction. Instead of past QAnon posts, which have sought to portray Trump’s actions that are clearly in support of the establishment as “anti-establishment,” these posts sought to cultivate support for something that has yet to take place but has loomed on the horizon for months. On Tuesday, QAnon called for regime change in Iran.

Just after midnight, the Q account posted “Free Iran!!! Fight Fight Fight Regime change. People have the power. We stand with you.” The post was not Q’s first reference to Iran, building off previous Q posts that warned simply that Iran was “next.” Those posts first emerged just as Iran hawk Bolton was set to join the Trump administration. However, Tuesday’s post was notable for its explicit call for regime change in the Islamic Republic, just weeks after covert U.S.-brokered regime change in Iran had become official U.S. policy.

Given the influence of QAnon, this shift is particularly concerning. **One of the reasons it is concerning is that it is based on disinformation often circulated by proponents of war with Iran. Qanon posts assert, for example, that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal, was not about nuclear disarmament or preventing a military conflict, but instead a greedy money-motivated plot planned by the Clintons and carried out by Obama. The money given to Iran after the deal by the Obama administration is used as evidence for this assertion, even though that money was the sum of Iranian assets that the U.S. had seized years prior when it imposed sanctions on Iran, something Bolton himself helped to accomplish while serving the George W. Bush administration.**

**Another related lie recently propagated by QAnon is that Bolton is fighting the “deep state” — by helping “clean” the White House and rid it of “disloyal” staff that are obstructing Trump’s mythical fight to free the country from the yoke of its shadow government — urging Trump supporters to “follow Bolton.” Since then, some Q enthusiasts have even taken Bolton’s frequent readjustment of his large glasses as a “sign” that he is part of the supposed counter-coup.**

As MintPress has reported at length, there is perhaps no figure in the Trump administration who embodies the “swamp” more than staunch neoconservative Bolton, who is well-known for distorting intelligence and information in his pursuit of regime change and the destruction of “rogue” states. Bolton’s top target for regime change is Iran, which he recently promised would see its government fall before the year was over. Bolton openly supports and has received tens of thousands of dollars from the Iranian terror group Mujahedeen Khalq (MEK), which has next to no domestic support in Iran. Most concerning of all perhaps is that Bolton’s current regime-change policy calls for military action to effect regime change if all else fails, a policy that could well lead to another disastrous war that will make the 2003 invasion of Iraq seem insignificant by comparison.

Regime change in Iran is diametrically opposed to the “Make America Great Again” mantra that espoused ending foreign entanglements abroad in order to improve the country’s domestic situation. A war in Iran would not only waste vast amounts of American taxpayer money, it would do nothing to help the situation of the average American worker, instead enriching the weapons manufacturers – including those in which Trump personally owns stock. However, QAnon’s increasingly insidious influence is linking the myth of a heroic counter-coup with the myth that regime change in Iran is what the “people” want and is good for the Iranian people and the world.

Martin asserted that the recent QAnon posts seem to be aimed at preparing Trump’s base for a war they would normally not accept. He told MintPress:

**QAnon appears to be slowly grooming millions of people on the internet who had normally been skeptical of pro-government narratives in the past to ‘trust the plan’ — aka trust everything Donald Trump is doing including hiring dangerous neocons who want to overthrow the government of Iran.”**

Given QAnon’s foray into fostering support for regime change abroad, the recognition of the phenomenon as a psyop that preys on the wishes and emotions that Trump as a candidate cultivated in his supporters seems inevitable, particularly as it has begun claiming that all concerns over a looming war should be ignored. Instead, Q urges followers to “trust the plan.”

Allowing long-standing neo-conservative policies and posturing for war to masquerade as an uprising against the “deep state” and “a draining of the swamp,” QAnon has turned reality on its head by manipulating a desire among many Americans for an end to Washington corruption. It is arguably a modern psyop like no other.

 

“Trust the plan”: Getting folks to support policies they hate

It may seem odd that an anonymous account with claims of top security clearance – but no evidence to support that claim – has convinced thousands of Trump supporters to continue to back the president and even praise him for neocon-inspired policies, U.S.-backed regime change among them, that they would have reviled not long ago. This narrative twisting, however, is hardly unprecedented.

Under Obama, many of those on the left, who had placed their hopes for reform on the charismatic senator promising “change,” willfully ignored Obama’s continuation and expansion of Bush-era policies such as torture, the prosecution of whistleblowers, drone strikes and imperial wars abroad. Those who rejected the reality of Obama’s policy instead asserted that the only way to ensure that the long-promised “change” could manifest was if more corporate-funded, establishment Democrats were elected.

**For many of those supporters, Obama himself was never to blame for – as Cornel West famously asserted – being a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface.” Even now, many on the left have placed Obama on an even higher pedestal — as Trump seems, superficially, to be his polar opposite, despite expanding many of Obama’s worst policies. As was the case with many on the left under Obama, it is now easier for MAGA enthusiasts to assert – with Q as “proof” — that Trump is still the candidate of 2016 instead of admitting that they have been had.**

The same ignorance as benighted the Obama-rationalizing left can now be seen among Trump’s supporters, with calls to elect even more Republicans to Congress, despite their current majority in both houses, as the way to manifest Trump’s “populist” manifesto he touted as a candidate.

**Thanks to QAnon, Trump will continue to remain blameless in the minds and hearts of many of his supporters, as those who blindly follow the “Gospel of Q” will continue to “trust the plan” no matter what Trump does, even if it results in a devastating war with Iran that kills millions of innocent people.**

IMO it was a psyop. I would understand a bit better if they stormed and raided the Capitol building AFTER Biden got certified. That alone smells fishy to me and having prior experience working with emergency and disaster management professionals, there's 0 chance that the Capitol Police were THAT undermanned and unprepared. From what I've seen working alongside local and state agencies, there's no chance.

Anyhow, now the media, celebrities, Democrats, Republicans, and just about anyone in power is pushing for the deplatformation (not sure if that's a word) of Trump and anyone sharing theories about Q. I haven't followed or seen everything posted by Q, but as far as I'm aware, things are still going in the way he's projected. Like I said I don't follow Qanon, I just enjoy seeing their posts pop up on here. 

It seems like most of us were aware that big media and big tech censorship was coming down the pipe with a Biden win eventually, but no one expected anything this dramatic and this excessive. Twitter and Facebook deplatforming Trump seemed inevitable as well.  Although I don't agree with the deplatformating of the President by Twitter and Facebook, I understand where their argument is based. There simply isn't any oversight or regulation, and it's not looking like there will be. There was a post on this subreddit referencing some governmental power to disable the Emergency Alert System from reaching am/fm radio transmissions (can't find it any longer...please link if you saw it). It's wild what extents they're going to in order to shadowban President Trump swiftly and completely. 

The fact that is all happening so quickly just goes to show how scared they really are of 'we the people'. That is the only thing they are afraid of. I want to hope that this #Italygate story is the real deal, but I haven't seen or heard anything about it in a couple days now so who knows. Trump and his team would be suppressing the story to hide it from 'coming out' and blowing up organically, and the MSM and media elites would NEVER touch this.

A link to /r/actualconspiracies - a low-traffic controlled opposition sub that sources pretty much solely from MSM articles

A link to /r/ConspiracyMemes 

A link to ""[RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reddit#.2Fr.2Fconspiracy)"" about r/conspiracy, which hilariously reads:

>The front page of paranoia on the Internet. Run by a white supremacist moderator who worships Timothy McVeigh, they made Hitler Did Nothing Wrong their official documentary long before Trump ever considered running for president. Theories discussed here run the gamut from 9/11 to chemtrails to lizard people. 

>/r/conspiracy has a large subscription base but is considered by many to be the laughingstock of the site, with regulars routinely accusing anyone who disrupts their echo chamber of panicking of being a ""shill"" or an evil impostor working for the government/Jewish overlords/reptilians. Despite being presented as an open forum and ""thinking ground"" which ""respects people of all religions and creeds,"" we dare you try to question prolific appearances of Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and Alex Jones. Lastly, anytime a mass shooting or a terrorist attack or anything horrible where many people die or are injured, it is automatically considered a false flag perpetrated by the United States government. No exceptions. 

>Many /r/conspiracy regulars actually believe that most of Reddit is paid government employees watching them (and yet they still go there - which might prove there is a genuine need for it and/or it is simply addictive). Due to the insanity and hostility of the subreddit, other subreddits such as /r/conspiratard and /r/actualconspiracies have been set up to take a slightly more rational approach to conspiracy discussion. People who are interested in woo but not politics, meanwhile, have mostly fled to /r/ConspiracyII. 

>In September of 2014, the subreddit showed how anti-Semitic it really is by posting the documentary Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told in their sidebar (which included a big picture of Hitler's face). The move caused major controversy and was heavily panned by /r/conspiratard and /r/subredditdrama.[33] Despite everything (though it shouldn't be any surprise), the documentary stayed up, and anyone who didn't like it were deemed Zionist Shills. 

>It is regularly featured on r/TopMindsOfReddit, another watchdog sub. 

A [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/trump-fbi-texts-conspiracy-theory/index.html) about conspiracy theorists and Trump, which oddly enough doesn't even mention this sub once.

A [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-conspiracy-theorist-study/) titled ""Here's One Way to Reform an Internet Conspiracy Theorist"", which warns that beliving in ANY CONSPIRACY THEORIES at all means you're ""a short walk from false flags to ""crisis actors""—and from there, Pizzagate and full-on Alex Jones-ville aren't far behind.""

And finally, [this NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtube-search-results-list-celebrities-hijacked-conspiracy-theorists-n895926) article discrediting all claims of pedophilia in Hollywood, advocating YouTube further censor it's search results (ironic considering the entire topic of this OP), and again shits on Qanon for some reason.

Now, if you type in the words ""reddit ______"" with any sub or topic, that will be the first result every single time. Except for r/conspiracy. Hell, even typing ""reddit donald"" or ""reddit greatawakening"" will give you those subs as the top result, so it's not a matter of hiding ""right wing"" or fake news content. Does anyone know if Google does this with any other sub?

They are hiding r/conspiracy because we are often right above the targets that no one else is talking about. Topics that the both the left AND right media mutually agree to ignore. Despite reddit's best efforts to disrupt this sub with constant brigading and trolling, we continue to be a thorn in the side of people that want things hidden from the public eye.

Keep fighting everyone. We're obviously doing something right. ",conspiracy,QAnon

Pearl Harbor got the USA into World War 2. I know that. You know that. Everyone knows that. Well, almost everyone. I'm pretty sure those tribesmen living on Sentinel Island don't know that. You remember, that island that doesn't like visitors from the outside world.    


###American killed by isolated tribe on India's North Sentinel Island, police say.   

The protected Sentinelese people are known to resist contact with outsiders, often attacking anyone who comes near. [SOURCE HERE](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/american-killed-isolated-tribe-india-s-north-sentinel-island-police-n938826)      


Ok. They probably have been left out of the loop, and therefore don't have any idea about our New Normal reality of 2020. Hmmm, maybe we should all buy tickets and take our chances that they don't have Covid-19 yet? Nah. I'd rather not face **able** tribes full of **archers** with more **arrows** in their **quiver**.    

And besides, who speaks Sentinelese? Not me. Not you. Does Google even translate Sentinelese? And since we know that words matter, how would we understand our New Normal talk?    



###9-11 The New Normal Begins  


The Project for the **New** American Century, PNAC, started in 1997. You might remember them for this quote:      


>And in a report just before the 2000 election that would bring Bush to power, the group predicted that the shift would come about slowly, unless there were ""some catastrophic and catalyzing event, like a new Pearl Harbor.""    


Back in the day when our journalists weren't compromised and pushed to near bankruptcy by the **New Normal World Economic Forum Order** (if you can't sell newspapers, you might as well sell data • Terms and Conditions apply) we could still get real information from our media, not a lot mind you, but it was there.     


>Some critics of the Bush administration's foreign policy, especially in Europe, have portrayed PNAC as, in the words of Scotland's Sunday Herald, ""a secret blueprint for U.S. global domination."" [ABC NEWS](https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=128491&page=1)     



But it's all a conspiracy theory, isnt it? We're crazy, delusional, suffering from mass hysteria!    


>The group was never secret about its aims. In its 1998 open letter to Clinton, the group openly advocated unilateral U.S. action against Iraq because ""we can no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War coalition"" to enforce the inspections regime.       

They wrote a letter? A letter. Did it go like this? Dear Bill, do what you're told? Nah. They all knew about it. And what about that letter?    


>Of the 18 people who signed the letter, 10 are now in the Bush administration. As well as Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, they include Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage; John Bolton, who is undersecretary of state for disarmament; and Zalmay Khalilzad, the White House liaison to the Iraqi opposition. Other signatories include William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, and Richard Perle, chairman of the advisory Defense Science Board.


###Every Day is Pearl Harbor Groundhog Day     


Words matter. Look at the Great Reset. Look at Build Back Better. If people were cognizant, they would stop and ask themselves how is this possible? In the middle of a great Pandemic, most of the world leaders started suddenly coordinating on the future. Yes the Great Reset idea seems to have started in **2012**, so yes they have talked about it, but aren't the leaders so busy that this should have been put off until we get through the crisis? Why it's almost like they're pushing a war and saying, We're All In This New Normal Together and You're Either With Us Or Against Us.      



>(CNN)The US surgeon general said this week is going to be the ""hardest and the saddest"" for ""most Americans' lives,"" describing the upcoming grim period of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as a ""Pearl Harbor moment"" and a ""9/11 moment."" [Source Here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/politics/jerome-adams-coronavirus/index.html)     


Hmmm. Let's take a look around this Pearl Harbor talk, shall we.     


>US President Donald Trump has described the coronavirus pandemic as the ""worst attack"" ever on the United States, pointing the finger at China.

Ah, the day that lived in infamy. The day the United States was dragged into World War 2. 


>It really is a Pearl Harbor moment, and are we going to be able to gear up?” Lieberman asked. “Here we are now, it’s a crisis and maybe going to be a catastrophe. … We’d be in a lot better shape if people had acted earlier.” [Source Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-shows-trump-administration-problems-with-biodefense-plan/2896252001/)      


Do you see the insertion into our subconscious yet? The majority of us don't see anything. A few of us see a single word and yell, conspiracy! And even less of us see the pattern that's being formed in Charlotte's World Wide Web.

###Our 9-11 Pearl Harbor Dark Winter     


The New Normal isn't new. Not at all. Look back at the start of these posts and you'll see that the phrase started just after 9-11. We're All In This Together started just after the Las Vegas shootings in 2017. You're Either With Us Or Against Us overtly started with 9-11.   


>Hillary Clinton said on 13 September 2001: ""Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.""
>>President George W. Bush, in an address to a joint session of Congress on 20 September 2001 said, ""Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."" [SOURCE HERE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_either_with_us,_or_against_us)     

And if you read the wiki link, you'll see that phrase inserted into tons of children's programming. Kind of scary, isnt it? Hidden in plain sight.       


###What is the Cobra Event     


>The Cobra Event is a 1998 thriller novel by Richard Preston describing an attempted bioterrorism attack on the United States. The perpetrator of the attack has genetically engineered a virus, called ""Cobra"", that fuses the incurable and highly contagious common cold with one of the world's most virulent diseases, smallpox. The disease that results from the virus, called brainpox in the novel, has symptoms that mimic those of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome and the common cold. The book is divided between descriptions of the virus and the government's attempt to stop the imminent threat posed by it.[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cobra_Event)    


It's a book, silly. Duh. It's not always a conspiracy theory. I just wanted to turn this into a book of the month to discuss a **great book** and how much it's impacted us and led to this Great New Normal World Economic Forum Order Reset.    


>“In April 1998, as a result of having read the Richard Preston novel, The Cobra Event, the president held a meeting with a group of scientists and Cabinet members to discuss the threat of bioterrorism,” the scholar Martha Crenshaw wrote in a 2006 terrorism-studies anthology. “The briefing impressed Clinton so much that he asked the experts to brief senior officials in DOD and HHS.” [Source Here](https://time.com/5800393/coronavirus-national-stockpile-history/)      


Sweet! Billy Good 'Ol Boy Clinton has read it! Maybe he'll join our club? See, he apparently was so shocked that he actually read that book in one night and called the FBI in the morning to discuss it. So why vote, just let Author's run the country, right?     

So let's get a little more in depth on this. Because there's something else really interesting.     


>**May 4, 2020** • They call themselves, self mockingly, **the Cabal**—a small cluster of policy advisers and analysts now based in the Pentagon’s Office of Special Plans. In the past year, according to former and present Bush Administration officials, their operation, which was conceived by **Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense**, has brought about a crucial change of direction in the American intelligence community. These advisers and analysts, who began their work in the days after September 11, 2001, have produced a skein of intelligence reviews that have **helped to shape public opinion** and American policy toward Iraq. [Source Here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence)       


The Cabal. Paul Wolfowitz. 911. Pearl Harbor. Project For A New American Century. PNAC, for short. Yep. Buckle up. Write it down. This post is what you can show people to take our New Normal reality and make it real for them. Mainstream Media documents.        


Back to Richard Perle.  


>**March 20, 2008** • There were very clear aims in mind. One has to go back, psychologically, to September 11, 2001. The administration looks around and says: “My God, what might happen next?” And the fear that seized senior officials of the administration from the president on down was the possibility of another attack, this time with chemical or **biological weapons** or even nuclear weapons with nuclear materials.       



Information Warfare in plain sight. Psyops from PNAC. Seriously. This is all coalescing into something **Dark** and it might not be this **Winter**, but Winter is still Coming. 



>Before 9/11, we were as vulnerable as we were found to be on 9/11 and if [Osama] Bin Laden had waited until he got the **biological weapons** he was looking for, God knows how many would have died in New York City or in some other attack. [Source Here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2008/3/20/interview-richard-perle)       



###Final Thoughts     


New World Order. PNAC. Dark Winter exercise. The Cabal. 9-11 The New Normal. Event 201. Pandemic.    


This is all just the tip of the Iceberg and we might never find out how deep the Iceberg goes, but we can at least see the collision course and get the lifeboats ready. Want to see something else really interesting? Who started the pandemic defense stockpiles? Bill Clinton. And who loves going to Davos and the WEF?   


>10. The most powerful man on earth: Ronald Reagan joined the Davos crowd several times - but only via video link. The first sitting US president to appear in Davos was Bill Clinton in 2000, at the forum's 30th anniversary session. He's been a regular attendee in most years since. President George Bush - father and son - never came to the village in the Swiss mountains, and President Barack Obama is a Davos no-show as well.[Source Here](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12232883)     


Neither Bush went, nor did Obama. Can we glean anything from this? I'm not sure at this point. Does this mean that I think Trump is a good guy or QAnon is a deep state adversary? No. So what do I think? Not sure yet, honestly, but I'm not going to pin my hopes on any politician. They sell us a contract of hope yet keep the terms and conditions hidden from us. 


This post is what you need to focus on when talking to friends and family. People that you love. Credited past sources can be ignored, but they can't be called fake facts. Show and tell people links that they can't dismiss. I may be wrong on certain information about what's happening since the start of this series, time will tell, but we will find more details as we move forward. There is a big picture here, and it's slowly coming into focus, now all we need to do is shift focus on the new normies that can't focus.

To Trump the deep state is anyone “he doesn’t like”

Meanwhile Trump gladly shills to the actual deep state (Cronyism, the Military Industrial Complex) all the time

If Trump was opposed to the deep state how come he hasn’t ended a single war (and has often been on the verge of starting ones with Iran and Venezuela) and has actually had more drone strikes than Bush and Obama COMBINED? How come he gladly bailed out Wall Street?

Trump has always been an elite, the elites used him to pander to a growing antiestablishment movement while he could continue their agendas. 

Not to mention you have seen Trumpsters infest “Conspiracy Theory” communities in order to give the real us a bad look. What happened to “Conspiracy Theorist” hating whoever is president? QAnon is neocon garbage to distract from real child sex trafficking (I wonder if they realize their lord and savior Trump is a pedophile who has ties to Epstein and frequently sexualized underage girls (including his daughters)

The deep state elites also love Trump because his chaos and drama distracts people from real issues. (Notice how the corporate news only talks about what dumb tweet or drama of the day he caused but never his actual policy?)

The Deep State loves the capital hill riots Trump allowed to happen because now it will give them a good excuse to update the PATRIOT Act (how come Trump allowed the PATRIOT Act to be extended?)

I’m using these as examples, so don’t take all them literally. 

—People who believe in QAnon, laugh judge and mock ones who believe in flat earth. Vice versa.  

—I see both sides hate the government.. but cheer on what their beliefs align with when a law is passed.   

—“I voted for Biden because I hate Trump” seems to be an acceptable excuse.. until I see people shaming Republicans for “I voted for Trump because I hate Hillary”.  

—We all tend to loathe the government and politicians.. yet keep their bullshit at the center of our lives and talking points.

—Don’t get me started on the hypocrisy of “my body, my choice” from both left and right. 

—Why do some people have a distaste for other people worshipping their God and believing in Christianity? As long as your faith doesn’t effect their life.. why do we use their faith as a tool to hurt someone?

Why do we all come to an agreement that the government is nothing but a bunch of greedy, power hungry, money laundering fools.. yet we argue with each other on conspiracies that they may well all have a hand in?

Idk. This post may make little to no sense.. but I am so sick and tired of seeing everyone arguing, contradicting themselves, showing pure hypocrisy, and being down right shitty people to one another.

Q anon claims to be an “insider” and promises to drop incriminating evidence on powerful people, yet very little of anything of substance has come from it. Mainly, it has achieved the creation of a cult like following for the current administration and has pacified its following into being complacent and looking to their false idol for answers and hope.

Couldn’t the “Dark Overlord” stuff be similar, but with regard to the September 11th attacks instead? 

The idea is for TPTB to place their own controlled opposition figure into position and use their resources to make them virally popular among the conspiracy community, hook a bunch of followers, and then steer them in any direction they want to. 

I can’t help but be skeptical of some of these campaigns, mainly because of how popular they become and how quickly they catch on with the community, as well as the lack of substance they produce.

156,"Dead Internet Theory - I hate it, but where did the real people go?",69.0,ve57o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ve57o6/dead_internet_theory_i_hate_it_but_where_did_the/,75.0,1655442230.0,"I don't know how much more of this I can take. Honestly, the worst part of everything is there is virtually NO WHERE to discuss anything online anymore beyond Reddit. I'm talking even normie basic topics, like say stocks or the like.

It's become clear to me that most of the internet is fake. Most people don't notice since they are so caught up in the life matrix that they use the internet purely for content consumption, and they have so little free time or are pure NPC normies perfectly content watching yet another rambling YouTube video about some stupid superhero movie or just watching endless tits and ass on TikTok.

I've seen ""dead internet theory"" mentioned a few times on here. What's funny is that there are several YouTube videos with 100ks of ""views"" as well as mainstream articles discussing the topic, but barely any really detailed talk online. Most Reddit posts on say [r/conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/) are in the tone of ""well, everyone knows that LOL"". I've noticed that same condescending tone multiple times in my experience with whatever ""AI"" runs the internet, doesn't matter what the topic.

I was into some light woo/conspiracy topics pre 2020, but really seeing how QAnon played out on Twitter plus endless video content on YouTube, Bitchute, etc. and then how literally every single conspiracy seems ""activated"" and latched onto that at the same time (e.g., new age, aliens, apocalypse, etc.) really drove home the concept for me. There was endless video and written content to consume, but try to actually ""talk"" about how things just didn't make sense, and it was a brick wall.

It seems this cancer has spread to everything. Like I tried to escape the endless woo cycle since it's not like the content is actionable, but then stocks and crypto went crazy (and stupid) with things like GameStop plus endless nonsensical crypto scams and NFTs.

What really started to make sense to me was some of the stuff shared on this ""Quantum of Conscience"" YouTube channel with Matthew McKinley. Where he talked about some of the concepts mentioned on this Reddit. Like simulated reality, prison planet, etc. But of course it was just another endless rabbit hole with no actionable information, just some more terminology to define how I am being tortured. And I honestly can't believe he could sit there for 10+ years making the same videos every day, deleting videos constantly, not making money off YouTube but still going at it, and so on.

What's funny is how ""active"" YouTube comments seem on these woo channels. YouTube comments are not indexed by Google, not searchable unless you manually scroll down and then CTRL + F, and there is no way to DM anyone. But yeah, super detailed comments on there, with people saying they are desperate to talk to people. Yet no place to live text chat. I saw a Telegram posted one time by a user, joined it, barely anyone on there (like 10 ""people"" from a supposed channel of 60k+). And they talked about aliens...ugh...which made no sense other than to mock me as I had already had a shitty time with the alien bots and I find it just the stupidest woo angle.

""Dead internet theory"" answers a lot, combined with simulated reality, but then it's just another staged or planted idea. Even the weird retro forum it was ""found"" on is obvious staging. Go look at the responses beyond the initial post and it is the same endless gibberish found on 4Chan or Reddit or anything like that.

I have a lot to unpack and I'm not saying everything. But really I'm just done. I've joined I don't know how many Discords and Telegrams on not just woo/conspiracy, but even normie stuff and it is IMPOSSIBLE to carry on a conversation. I don't know what is going on. I remember using say IRC in early crypto days and it felt I was at least talking to people somewhat. Now the internet doesn't even seem to give that decency. And forget about anything approaching life or relationship talk. As you will see if you look at Reddit for any length of time, it is endless ""get a therapist, get pills, get a divorce."" Who is even writing the same crap over and over? How is that fun?

I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm leaving a ton out to keep this post short, but I feel like I've been ""steered"" to where I am now by online and now, thinking on it some, real world entities. Just enough money to survive, but not enough to really thrive. I don't even want to get into how some of these ""people"" I talked to in crypto for years and years, even though I voice talked with them and have knowledge of their identities, or at least what they say their identities are, seemed to go haywire and now give me nothing in terms of conversation.

I just feel trapped. And if I was single maybe I'd just give up and at least be a hedonist and travel, but I have a family and responsibilities and all that. But I don't know how much more of this I can take where the internet feels so completely fake and artificial and useless. And I love how I beg ""people"" on the internet hey where can I talk about so and so topic. If it's a paid group I'll pay. And over and over I get ""oh the internet is useless."" Then why are you here?! And I hear that over and over from different people online. Wasn't the lie for the longest time how you could be connected on niche topics? And oh sure, if you want to discuss some dumb hobby or some degenerate fetish, there is endless content (probably AI generated if you haven't caught onto my opinion at this point). But want anything actionable? Or any real connection? Forget about it.

Any questions, let me know. And honestly, if the Illuminati or the aliens or the AI or whatever the hell runs everything is watching: you win. Now give me next steps instead of endlessly torturing me with this stupid devil box of a computer.",conspiracy,QAnon

**McKinnon:** I also got access to Excel spreadsheets. One was titled ""Non-Terrestrial Officers."" It contained names and ranks of U.S. Air Force personnel who are not registered anywhere else. It also contained information about ship-to-ship transfers, but I've never seen the names of these ships noted anywhere else.

**WN:** Could this have been some sort of military strategy game or outline of hypothetical situations?

**McKinnon:** The military want to have military dominance of space. What I found could be a game -- it's hard to know for certain.

**WN:** Some say that you have given the UFO motivation for your hacking as a distraction from more nefarious activities.

**McKinnon:** I was looking before and after 9/11. If I had wanted to distract anyone, I would not have chosen ufology, as this opens me up to ridicule.

**WN:** Did you find anything in your search for evidence of UFOs?

**McKinnon:** Certainly did. There is [The Disclosure Project](http://www.disclosureproject.org/). This is a book with 400 testimonials from everyone from air traffic controllers to those responsible for launching nuclear missiles. Very credible witnesses. They talk about reverse-(engineered) technology taken from captured or destroyed alien craft.

**WN:** Like the Roswell incident of 1947?

**McKinnon:** I assume that was the first and assume there have been others. These relied-upon people have given solid evidence.

**WN:** What sort of evidence?

**McKinnon:** A NASA photographic expert said that there was a Building 8 at Johnson Space Center where they regularly airbrushed out images of UFOs from the high-resolution satellite imaging. I logged on to NASA and was able to access this department. They had huge, high-resolution images stored in their picture files. They had filtered and unfiltered, or processed and unprocessed, files.

My dialup 56K connection was very slow trying to download one of these picture files. As this was happening, I had remote control of their desktop, and by adjusting it to 4-bit color and low screen resolution, I was able to briefly see one of these pictures. It was a silvery, cigar-shaped object with geodesic spheres on either side. There were no visible seams or riveting. There was no reference to the size of the object and the picture was taken presumably by a satellite looking down on it. The object didn't look manmade or anything like what we have created. Because I was using a Java application, I could only get a screenshot of the picture -- it did not go into my temporary internet files. At my crowning moment, someone at NASA discovered what I was doing and I was disconnected.

**On 20 July 2010, Tom Bradby,** [**ITN**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN)**'s political editor, raised the Gary McKinnon issue with U.S. President** [**Barack Obama**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) **and Prime Minister David Cameron in a joint White House press conference who responded that they had discussed it and were working to find an 'appropriate solution'.**



from the Oprah Winfrey Show of July 19, 1991: 
Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchel:

""... I do believe there is a lot more known about extraterrestrial investigation than is available to the public right now ... has been for a long time.""

Oprah: ""And why do you think it's kept from the public?""

Mitchell: ""Well, that's a long, long story. It goes back to World War II when all of that happened ... and highly-classified stuff.""

TLDR: I am not saying ANY of this is truth or fact, however there are some connected dots that paint a bigger picture of Antarctica than what is told to the public. I admit that the Nazi connection is tenuous at best. Follow the dots and it leads one to make a connection that USA was involved in reverse engineering technology beyond understanding. Or more importantly, why the USA was in a mad scramble to further technology at exponential speed. Consider the tech of 1940s up to now. Quite a leap.

Well, look how it turned out for the Unabomber.

The thing is, nothing good can come out of Qanon itself. It literally tells people that it's a government project and asks them to pledge loyalty to secret agent of the government, then pledge loyalty to each other with WWG1WGA. Has a secret government program ever led to ANYTHING good? Especially one where people take an oath to a person/movement they don't even know.

Now, the child trafficking is just chosen because it will draw a crowd. But how do we know they aren't running this operations in various ways to develop factions of people and gauging their involvement in it.

In other words, this is a massive MK Ultra study, or at worst, a foreign power using it to divide America.

At any rate, I just think it is very bizarre that Qanon is saying he is a secret government agent and there is a group of people who think that's a good thing to follow.

Let's examine the Great Reset Conspiracy Theory. You know, the Conspiracy which doesn't exist. 

#The coronavirus pandemic 'Great Reset' theory and a false vaccine claim debunked



#####Justin Trudeau and the 'Great Reset'

>We start with the revival of the baseless conspiracy theory, known as the 'Great Reset', which claims a group of world leaders orchestrated the pandemic to take control of the global economy.

>It started trending globally on Twitter last week, when a video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a UN meeting, saying the pandemic provided an opportunity for a ""reset"", went viral.    

Ok. Actually, no, people started getting spooked when they noticed a whole lot of world ""leaders"" saying the Great Reset all at the same time. 

>According to The New York Times, the BBC, The Guardian, Le Devoir and Radio Canada, ""baseless"" conspiracy theories spread by American far-right groups linked to QAnon surged at the onset of the Great Reset forum and increased in fervor as leaders such as U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau incorporated ideas based on a ""reset"" in their speeches.    
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset)

So please forgive me when I read the next article and laugh out loud over the inane message. 

>This sparked fresh claims from people, within Canada and further afield, **that a cabal of global leaders** is using the pandemic to introduce a range of damaging socialist and environmental policies.    

So you mean to tell me that Biden, Trudeau, and Prince Charles aren't a Cabal of World leaders?   


>The Great Reset is the name of the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), held in June 2020. It brought together high-profile business and political leaders, convened by **Charles, Prince of Wales** and the WEF, with the theme of rebuilding society and the economy in a sustainable way following the COVID-19 pandemic.   
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset)     


Because that's what this looks like exactly to me, a bunch of world leaders making decisions without consulting or asking us. They meet behind closed doors at the WEF, do their deals, and then turn around and implement. Sure, maybe the virus did happen naturally, and they just started warning us about in 2015 because they knew it was a matter of time. So they made plans and executed them, like shutting down all the airports. Oh, wait, that never actually happened, they just made it really expensive to fly for the average joe. But at least they're shutting down people from entering into the country from high risk areas, like India, right?   

#COVID flight ban forces Indian international students to come to Canada via third country

#####Travelling via a third country is time consuming and stressful — potentially even dangerous — says one student who hopes to study in Alberta come September   
[Source Here](https://nationalpost.com/news/covid-flight-ban-forces-indian-international-students-to-come-to-canada-via-third-country)   

Silly me, they never do actually put containment measures in place. It's all just a show. Why, it's almost like they want everything to get bad, isn't it? But if that happened, wouldn't we have to start all over again, like a Reset? Hmmmm. Nah. Can't be. Let's ask Justin. 


>When asked about conspiracy theories at the end of the week, Mr Trudeau said: ""I think we're in a time of anxiety, where people are looking for reasons for things that are happening to them... we're seeing a lot of people fall prey to disinformation.""    

We're just stupid. That's it. That's the ticket. We can't tell lies from truth. Perfect. I guess they really need to ramp up the education system then, don't they? Otherwise we'll keep falling for all the same lies all over again, and again, and again. Like this next one. 


>But the suggestion that politicians planned the virus, or are using it to destroy capitalism is wholly without evidence.
[Source Here](https://www.bbc.com/news/55017002)   

And the paragraph is right, sort of. They don't want to destroy capitalism. No, sorry, they don't. Why would they, it leaves them with all the power and control. Without money, they wouldn't have any carrots to offer the plough horses, so to speak.    

As everyone reading this should have figured out by now, they want two systems, capitalism for them, and trickle down welfare for us. This is what the Great Reset really means. This is why UBI suddenly became such a widely talked about subject, and it's counterpart, Inclusive Capitalism.   


#Why the next stage of capitalism is coming  

>In policy, there's ""inclusive capitalism"", advocated by both the Bank of England and The Vatican, which advocates harnessing ""capitalism for good"".    
[Source Here](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210525-why-the-next-stage-of-capitalism-is-coming)    

Ah yes, Inclusive Capitalism. Because they care. They really do. Just take a look through the news at all the homeless camps that have been happening. Or all the seniors who don't make enough any more to make ends meet. Or all the jobs that keep getting off shored to countries with no labor laws and a cheaper dollar. Yep. They care. They really do. Just ask Lynn Forester de Rothschild, because she's the mastermind behind Inclusive Capitalism.    

So the Great Reset is about a more inclusive kind of Capitalism. One that looks out for you and me. They'll bring back all the jobs and stop off shoring them so the robots and algorithms can do our jobs for us?

#Watch Robots Make Pizzas From Start to Finish at an Automated Pizzeria
[Source Here](https://singularityhub.com/2021/07/14/watch-robots-make-pizzas-from-start-to-finish-at-an-automated-pizzeria/)    


Crap. Oh well, at least the pizza will be cheaper since they don't have to pay us. 

>**Despite the savings on employee training and labor that the robots bring to Pazzi, its prices are about on par with what you’d expect from a traditional counter-service “fast casual” restaurant**, ranging from 7 to 14 euros for a pizza that feeds 1 to 2 people.    
Pazziria may have seemed a bit crazy when the idea was first conceived of years ago, but now it’s seeming downright logical. Restaurants are experiencing a massive staffing shortage post-pandemic, with many of the workers who were laid off, quit, or were furloughed showing little interest in returning to their jobs, often because they’ve moved to new geographic locations.
**Thus, just as the pandemic accelerated other tech trends—including automation, e-commerce, and remote work—it seems likely to give robotic food service a forward push.**   

Oh what a coincidence, just as the pandemic started, all these programs and automation were ready to go. Got it. Well maybe we can make t-shirts or something?

So very shortly, cause this will pick up steam, the housing industry market for work will start to collapse. But at least they'll use the small houses to give us something to rent through UBI! Yeeehaw!   

And just in case you think post is getting extreme, take a look.



#Study: During Pandemic, More Workers Are Replaced by Robots

>The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the trend of robots replacing humans in the workplace, which could result in a recovery from recession that nonetheless costs jobs, according to a new report.

>Workers whose jobs can be done by machines suffered more layoffs per capita than those with jobs that aren’t as easily automated, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said in a report released Monday. People of color were especially harmed, possibly because of their concentration in service jobs at risk of automation.

>The report noted that most job losses during the health crisis are expected to be temporary. Yet, cashiers, hotel staffers, parking attendants, and others are at risk of permanently losing work if companies become satisfied with labor-saving technology, or if fears over future pandemics convince firms to stick with machines. The report added that previous recessions resulted in technology replacing laid-off workers too, leading to “jobless recoveries.”      
>**The result has been hotels replacing humans with self-check-in kiosks, meatpacking plants deploying slaughterhouse robots, and call centers using artificial intelligence to hold conversations.** The study specifically cited the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, which went cashless and laid off 500 toll workers.

With pizzagate coming about during the 2016 election cycle there would be no way for a future president to pretend that the entire thing didn't exist.  

With Trump in office, an outside president hell bent on destroying corruption, I'm sure plenty of people expected pizzagate to be fully exposed and the guilty parties dealt with.

Nothing happened immediately after Trump was elected. There were no pizzagate arrests. There were no pizzagate investigations. The MSM could still go full bore and completely deny every accusation and call it all insane. Essentially pizzagate would continue.

The longer that pizzagate went on without any action being taken by Trump the more likely it would be that conspiracy theorists might start seeing Trump as part of the problem. Basically since Trump took no action into attacking pizzagate there could eventually come a time when Trump is seen as enabling child rape, just as other corrupt politicians had been.

Now in comes qanon. All the sudden there is a reason for conspiracy theorists to not expect immediate action taken against pizzagate. Now there is a conspiracy that covers the conspiracy about Trump not attacking pizzagate head on.

The longer that qanon went on the more conspiracies it ultimately covered. Not all of them were referenced directly by qanon but the vagueness allowed many interpretations and therefor many conspiracies into the fold. This allowed for more openings to get people into the idea. It made it more appealing to more conspiracy theorists.

Could qanon just be a tool to keep places like this from turning their sights onto the president who didn't attack pizzagate head on?

**TLDR:**

Conveniently qanon allows conspiracy theorists to be fine with Trump not immediately exposing and arresting those involved in pizzagate.

Trump can simultaneously keep the corrupt, pedophile enabling, politicians in power and get recognition for taking them down.

**Boiled down into one sentence:** qanon allows the pedos to stay out of prison and Trump gets away with not taking them down.",conspiracy,QAnon

Project Briefing and Background

In 1972, in a remote section of northern New Mexico, a group of hikers discovered an unusual artifact and pictographs within an obscure canyon. An archeologist from the University of New Mexico analyzed the artifact and searched the area where it was discovered, but found no signs that a prehistoric culture had established any permanent site in the canyon. It was presumed that a nomadic, Native American Indian tribe had occasionally used the canyon as a temporary settlement and had left behind a few artifacts of their presence as a consequence. There were, however, two very puzzling questions. All but one of the artifacts could be dated to the 8th century AD. The exception, known as the ""compass"" artifact, appeared to be an unusual form of technology, and was found among more typical artifacts like pottery and simple tools. The compass was covered in strange hieroglyphic symbols, some of which were also found on the pottery. Secondly, the pictographs that were found in the area had inexplicably appeared, and they were strikingly different than any of the other native petroglyphs or rock art found in the southwest or the entire continent for that matter.

Because of these two anomalies, the artifacts and the entire project quickly became the property of the US government, or more specifically, the National Security Agency. It was decided that these artifacts might suggest a pre-historical, extraterrestrial presence on earth, and that the NSA had the appropriate agenda and wherewithal to initiate a full-scale, scientific expedition to determine the nature and significance of the site.

The site was completely searched by a secret department of the NSA in 1973, but it only resulted in a few additional findings, and none of them were designated as technologies or evidence of an extraterrestrial presence. Additional pictographic symbols were found, but decoding them was a difficult and frustrating process. Experts were called in to help, but it was impossible to reach a consensus as to what the pictographs meant. As quickly as the project had risen as a priority investigation, it fell into the archives of the NSA under the code name, Ancient Arrow.

Twenty-one years later, in 1994, a series of rockslides opened up a section of the Ancient Arrow site. The canyon was in a naturally obscure section of park land held by the state of New Mexico. After its discovery in 1972, it had been officially sanctioned off-limits to hikers and campers and was to be left in its natural state. From time-to-time, scientists -- sponsored by the NSA -- would visit the site hoping to uncover new evidence, but were invariably disappointed.

Shortly after the rockslide occurrence, a small team of operatives from the NSA visited Ancient Arrow canyon to do some follow-up research. They discovered the rockslide had exposed an entrance to a hidden cavern that led deep within the canyon walls.

At the back of this cavern, the research team discovered a well-hidden entrance into the interior of the canyon wall or rock structure of the Ancient Arrow site. There they found a system of tunnels and chambers that had been carved out from solid rock. There were a total of 23 chambers, all intricately connected to an interior corridor, and each chamber held a specific wall painting, series of pictographs, written hieroglyphs, and what seemed to be dormant, alien technologies.

Once this entrance to the cavern was found, a report was immediately filed with the Director responsible for the Ancient Arrow project. The project was then formally brought under the jurisdiction of the Advanced Contact Intelligence Organization (ACIO), which organized an inter-disciplinary research team to assess the exact nature of the site and attempt to discover additional artifacts or evidence of an extraterrestrial visitation.

TEASER FROM THE INTERVIEWS:

Anne: ""When you say 'visiting you', what evidence did you have that the WingMakers might be visiting you?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I was spending 70 hours per week working on the decoding formulas for the symbol pictures, and this went on for about 8 months. During this time I tried every conceivable combination to create an access code to the optical disc. I was convinced it was the only way to open it. I was also convinced that it was purposely made to be difficult, at least to our presentday brains. It was almost as though the struggle to decode their language was exercising a part of my brain or nervous system that was enabling me to communicate with them.

""I began to hear them speaking to me. It began as a word or two . . . then a sentence . . . maybe just once a day. It didn't make much sense . . . what I heard. But then one day I was working on a chamber painting and I saw something move in the painting. One of the symbols moved and it was absolutely not an illusion or trick of the light. Then I realized that the WingMakers could interact with me, that they were time traveling to my time and that somehow their paintings were actually portals in which they moved through time.

""It was then I began to hear their instructions, or more precisely, their thoughts. I was given mental images on how to use the Sumerian language to decode their own symbol pictures. I thought I was possibly going crazy. I felt like my mind was playing tricks on me . . . that I was working too hard and needed to take a holiday, but I listened to the voices because it seemed plausible what I was being instructed to do. When I finished with the access code and it worked, I knew then that I was indeed communicating with them. Anne: ""Did you tell anyone? I mean about the fact that you were communicating with the WingMakers?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I kept it a secret. I wasn't sure how I would be able to explain the phenomenon and I didn't want to arouse suspicions, so I went about my business and began developing the translation indexes for the 8,110 pages of text that was discovered within the optical disc. It was essential that we had a letter-for-letter index in order to retain the meaning of their language . . . we called this translation granularity. And as I started the process of translating the optical disc, I began to see fragment images of the WingMakers . . . sort of like a holographic image that would appear and then disappear in a matter of seconds.

""They visited me a total of three times -- always in my home at night -- and told me that I had been selected to be their liaison or spokesperson. Of course I asked them why me and not Fifteen, and they said that Fifteen was unable to speak for them because he was already the pawn of the Corteum.""

Anne:""Tell me about Fifteen. What is he like?""

Dr. Anderson: ""Fifteen is a genius of unparalleled intelligence and knowledge. He's the leader of the Labyrinth Group and has been since its inception in 1963. He was only 22 [twenty-two] years old when he joined the ACIO in 1956. I think he was discovered early enough before he had a chance to establish a reputation in academic circles. He was a renegade genius who wanted to build computers that would be powerful enough to time travel. Can you imagine how a goal like that -- in the mid-1950s -- must have sounded to his professors?

""Needless to say, he was not taken seriously, and was essentially told to get in line with academic protocols and perform serious research. Fifteen came to the ACIO through an alliance it had with Bell Labs. Somehow Bell Labs heard about his genius and hired him, but he quickly out-paced their research agenda and wanted to apply his vision of time travel."" Anne: ""Why was he so interested in time travel?""

Dr. Anderson: ""No one is absolutely sure. And his reasons may have changed over time. The accepted purpose was to develop Blank Slate Technology or BST. BST is a form of time travel that enables the re-write of history at what are called intervention points. Intervention points are the causal energy centers that create a major event like the break-up of the Soviet Union or the NASA space program.

""BST is the most advanced technology and clearly anyone who is in possession of BST, can defend themselves against any aggressor. It is, as Fifteen was fond of saying, the freedom key. Remember that the ACIO was the primary interface with extraterrestrial technologies and how to adapt them into mainstream society as well as military applications. We were exposed to ETs and knew of their agenda. Some of these ETs scared the hell out of the ACIO.""

Anne: ""Why?""

Dr. Anderson: ""There were agreements between our government -- specifically the NSA -- to cooperate with an ET species commonly called the Greys in exchange for their cooperation to stay hidden and conduct their biological experiments under the cloak of secrecy. There was also a bungled technology transfer program, but that's another story . . . [--] However, not all the Greys were operating within a unified agenda. There were certain groups of Greys that looked upon humans in much the same way as we look upon laboratory animals. ""They're abducting humans and animals, and have been for the past 48 [forty-eight] years . . . [--] they're essentially conducting biological experiments to determine how their genetics can be made to be compatible with human and animal genetic structure. Their interests are not entirely

understood, but if you accept their stated agenda, it's to perpetuate their species. Their species is nearing extinction and they're fearful that their biological system lacks the emotional development to harness their technological prowess in a responsible manner. ""Fifteen was approached by the Greys in his role at the ACIO, and they desired to provide a fullscale technology transfer program, but Fifteen turned them down. He had already established a TTP with the Corteum, and felt that the Greys were too fractured organizationally to make good on their promises. Furthermore, the Corteum technology was superior in most regards to the Greys . . . [--] with the possible exception of the Greys' memory implant and their genetic hybridization technologies.

""However, Fifteen and the entire Labyrinth Group carefully considered an alliance with the Greys if for no other reason than to have direct communication with regard to their stated agenda. Fifteen liked to be in the know . . . [--] so eventually we did establish an alliance, which consisted of a modest information exchange between us. We provided them with access to our information systems relative to genetic populations and their unique predisposition across a variety of criteria including mental, emotional, and physical behaviors; and they provided us with their genetic findings.

""The Greys, and most extraterrestrials for that matter, communicate with humans exclusively through a form of telepathy, which we called suggestive telepathy because to us it seemed that the Greys communicated in a such a way that they were trying to lead a conversation to a particular end. In other words, they always had an agenda, and we were never certain if we were a pawn of their agenda or we arrived at conclusions that were indeed our own. ""I think that's why Fifteen didn't trust the Greys. He felt they used communication to manipulate outcomes to their own best interest in favor of shared interests. And because of this lack of trust, Fifteen refused to form any alliance or TTP that was comprehensive or integral to our operations at either the ACIO or the Labyrinth Group.""

Anne: ""Did the Greys know of the existence of the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""I don't believe so. They were generally convinced that humans were not clever enough to cloak their agendas. Our analysis was that the Greys had invasive technologies that gave them a false sense of security as to their enemy's weaknesses. And I'm not saying that we were enemies, but we never trusted them. And this they undoubtedly knew. They also knew that the ACIO had technologies and intellects that were superior to the mainstream human population, and they had a modicum of respect -- perhaps even fear -- of our abilities.

""However, we never showed them any of our pure-state technologies or engaged them in deep dialogues concerning cosmology or new physics. They were clearly interested in our information databases and this was their primary agenda with respect to the ACIO. Fifteen was the primary interface with the Greys because they sensed a comparable intellect in him. The Greys looked at Fifteen as the equivalent of our planet's CEO.""

Anne: ""How did Fifteen become the leader of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""He was the Director of Research in 1958 when the Corteum first became known to the ACIO. In this position, he was the logical choice to assess their technology and determine its value to the ACIO. The Corteum instantly took a liking to him, and one of Fifteen's first decisions was to utilize the Corteum intelligence accelerator technologies on himself. After about three months of experimentation (most of which was not in his briefing reports to the then current Executive Director of the ACIO), Fifteen became infused with a massive vision of how to create BST.

""The Executive Director was frightened by the intensity of Fifteen's BST agenda and felt that it would divert too much of the ACIO's resources to a technology development program that was dubious. Fifteen was enough of a renegade that he enlisted the help of the Corteum to establish the Labyrinth Group. The Corteum were equally interested in BST for the similar reasons as Fifteen. The Freedom Key, as it was sometimes called, was established as the prime agenda of the Labyrinth Group, and the Corteum and Fifteen were its initial members.

""Over the next several years, Fifteen selected the cream of the crop from the scientific core of the ACIO to undergo a similar intelligence accelerator program as he had, with the intention of developing a group of scientists that could -- in cooperation with the Corteum -- successfully invent BST. The ACIO, in the opinion of Fifteen, was too controlled by the NSA and he felt the NSA was too immature in its leadership to responsibly deploy the technologies that he knew would be developed as an outgrowth of the Labyrinth Group. So Fifteen essentially plotted to take over the ACIO and was assisted by his new recruits to do so.

""This happened a few years before I became affiliated with the ACIO as a student and intern. My stepfather was very sympathetic to Fifteen's agenda and was helpful in placing Fifteen as the Executive Director of the ACIO. There was a period of instability when this transition occured [occurred], but after about a year, Fifteen was firmly in control of the agendas of both the ACIO and the Labyrinth Group.

""What I said earlier . . . [--] that he was viewed as the CEO of the planet . . . [--] that's essentially who he is. And of the ETs who are interacting with humankind, only the Corteum understand the role of Fifteen. He has a vision that is unique in that it is a blueprint for the creation of BST, and is closing in on the right technological and human elements that will make this possible.""

Anne: ""What makes BST such an imperative to Fifteen and the Labyrinth Group?""

Dr. Anderson: ""The ACIO has access to many ancient texts that contain prophecies of the earth. These have been accumulated over the past several hundred years through our network of secret organizations of which we are a part. These ancient texts are not known in academic institutions, the media, or mainstream society; they are quite powerful in their depictions of the 21st [twenty-first] century. Fifteen was made aware of these texts early on when he became Director of Research for the ACIO, and this knowledge only fueled his desire to develop BST.""

Anne: ""What were these prophecies and who made them?""

Dr. Anderson: ""The prophecies were made by a variety of people who are, for the most part, unknown or anonymous, so if I told you their names you would have no recognition. You see, time travel can be accomplished by the soul from an observational level . . . [--] that is to say, that certain individuals can move in the realm of what we call vertical time and see future events with great clarity, but they are powerless to change them. There are also those individuals who have, in our opinion, come into contact with the WingMakers and are provided messages about the future, which they had recorded in symbol pictures or extinct languages like Sumerian, Mayan, and Chakobsan.

""The messages or prophecies that they made had several consistent strands or themes that were to occur in the early part of the 21st [twenty-first] century, around the year 2011. Chief among these was the infiltration of the major governments of the world, including the United Nations, by an alien race. This alien race was a predator race with extremely sophisticated technologies that enabled them to integrate with the human species. That is to say, they could pose as humanoids, but they were truly a blend of human and android

How about this?

(July 30, 2019)

The Wingmakers aka Cosmic Central Race

The Cosmic Central Race has been in the spheres around planet Earth for some months now. They have already made contact with various Key Lightworkers on the surface and can also be contacted at any time in meditations. The Wingmakers in their non-physical form usually appear gigantically large in brightly shining silhouettes. But they can also turn into giant spheres that can actually serve as spaceships too. Sometimes they also seem to have a kind of beak, which is why they are often portrayed as birds or eagles.

The eagle can actually be regarded as the representative animal of the Central Cosmic Race, since it is completely free, stands above things and overlooks everything. This is also the reason, why the Native Americans worshipped the eagle and often wore feather decoration as headgear.

Two centuries ago, it was also the last time that the Wingmakers actively appeared as Walk-ins on the surface of the planet. Because of the fact that many positive indigenous tribes were so pure, the CCR were able to go into the avatars of a few lightful female and male shamans for a short time and thus could provide important knowledge to the people.

However, the Archons separated this connection by triggering the extermination of those tribes through the colonization of America, so that the CCR no longer had clean vessels available on the ground.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G02wKufX3nw&list=PL7-OSSX47tEey70xK8-2nexISCN231yRm

As with many other symbols (Swastika, All-Seeing Eye) the Dark Ones have also taken the symbol of the CCR, the eagle, and have attached it to their own flags. This is also the reason why many royal houses or nations have a one or double-headed eagle on their emblems (or see the Roman Aquila or the Imperial eagle of the Nazis). It’s all about appropriation of the radiant power of originally positive symbolism, because the Dark Ones have nothing comparable of their own.

But now, after a long journey from the Center of the Galaxy,

the “real” eagles are back and about to land. <-----------

And that means that the end of the Quarantine is approaching, because the CCR is energetically superior to the Chimera, comparable with a real eagle in the sky to a spider on the ground ... the Chimera fears the CCR.

Tolkien also referred to the Wingmakers, in form of the eagles which appear whenever the situation is most hopeless:

The most visible operation of the Light Forces is probably the Epstein case, which will crack the protective wall of the Cabal around the global paedophile system and will mark the beginning of a subsequent chain reaction of (worrisome) disclosures that will at some point end in the collapse of the matrix.

After the resignation of the English Prime Minister, you can also see further physical effects of the energetic liberation of the British Isles, by the publication that parts of the English (Fake) Royal Family are also involved in the Epstein case, which will at some point lead to their demise too...(and it continues https://fm144.blogspot.com)

It is quite evident when one reads the comparisons of the two interview changes that Fred gracefully laid out for us in the provided pdfs, that they were hiding something and not ""Adding to it"" as James Mahu stated in his email exchanges with Fred, that Fred has also published on his website.

What I offer here is just the tip of the iceberg.

They wanted to have everyone wear **masks,** symbolic of the **""we'll do whatever the fuck we want right in front of you and you'll all keep your mouths fucking shut out of FEAR""**. Much like what you see in bondage-porn. Control. Dominance. Power-over-others. Which is one victory that they did get, mind you. But then, the *plot went sideways.*  

You see, these elites are not the *only intelligent entities* upon our world (or beyond it). Neither are they as powerful as they think themselves to be. So, suffice it to say that they all got a little, errrrr....*outsmarted* here.  

Their plan to open a negative energy vortex/timeline using the CERN Hadron Collider and to grant [**dark beings access**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/701484/Satanic-human-sacrifice-video-CERN) into our dimension was derailed by [**gas leaks**](https://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn16254-damage-that-derailed-higgs-hunt/), [**bird droppings**](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/06/cern-big-bang-goes-phut), and [**actual fucking weasels**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36173247) showing up to ruin the party. But our dark friends refused to learn their lesson.  

So instead of [**""Pandemic 1""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g72f8s/bill_gates_just_called_the_coronavirus_pandemic_1/) killing off most of the human populace and getting the rest to obediently stand in line (in order to get chipped right back to slavery) [**other un-wanted things ensued**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/frd0qo/global_pandemic_or_global_gift/). Furthermore, as the [**masses started awakening**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fzpxdm/99_of_comments_on_bill_gatess_social_media_say/) and plenty of their lot started getting arrested, put in home-quarantine or ""getting the virus"" (code for [**getting killed**](https://www.eonline.com/news/1135492/spanish-princess-becomes-the-first-royal-to-die-of-coronavirus-complications) OR [**being quarantined for mass-trials later**](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/coronavirus-widespread-among-saudi-royal-family-report/ar-BB12nyMj) ) their plans just started going [**south**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/royals/king-felipe-of-spain-s-relative-86-becomes-first-royal-to-die-from-coronavirus/ar-BB11Q7uO) after [**south**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/covid-19-prince-charles-tests-positive-remains-in-self-isolation-in-scotland/articleshow/74810710.cms) after [**south**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8200269/Coronavirus-spreads-party-Venezuelan-elite.html), day after day after day.  

You see, it just so happens that this virus that they so carefully made to destroy humanity, happens to be super-lethal for Adrenochrome users. So all of those pre-created vaccines that so many of them took so happily before this epidemic got its ""worldwide release"" may not, well, *work* as nicely as they'd all hoped. Expect many, many more names of elites dying (due to Covid-19) to be hitting the news as we go along here. And before you even ask folks, YES, they [**ALL KNEW**](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/03/296939/insider-trading-us-senators-sold-stocks-before-covid-19-crash/) WHAT WAS COMING [**SINCE LONG, LONG, BACK**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fyy370/2013_rapper_predicts_2020_combined_with/fn2ju84/).   

Finally, the main question: **WHY EXACTLY is Elon Musk** ***doing*** **all of this?** Good question. You see, a few days back, [**these interesting videos**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9kzks/id_watch_these_coronavirus_protests_for_hours/) topped the [**very front page of Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9fxxg/usa/) with *all of the medals in the world* -- BOTH (front page + medal getting) being super sureshot signs here that all of the mainstream media **REALLY WANTED YOU TO SEE** *all of that stuff.* And oh by the way, both Elon Musk and Reddit posted this stuff out on the exact same day, because [**the NARRATIVE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4sisf/just_in_case_you_still_havent_figured_it_out/) must [**ALWAYS be consistent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ts3q/using_propaganda_to_shape_public_perceptions_of) ***no-matter-what.*** And obviously, most right-wingers wouldn't question as to how the entire video seems *staged* (just check out the presentation, background music used), right down to this [**super-pathetic actor dude**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g7fwve/can_you_cough_in_my_face/) and his *fake-as-fuck-talk* in which he lists out **every single ""tinfoil-hatter-conspiracy-nutjob-trope-there-is""** right down to the last fucking T? With *Flat-Earth* and all of that shit included? Yes folks. Many or all of those folks that you saw in those videos were actors infiltrating the protests.  

But why even **do** all of this? *What exactly* does one stand to gain from all of this counter-lockdown protesting? It's easy. You see, by NOW painting the lockdown as a ""left-wing conspiracy"" (because their mass murder plans failed and THEY started getting arrested instead (whereas the normal people simply remained SAFE inside their own homes), they realised that they were losing and LOSING HARD. So what is the last fucking option that they all had *left* here? That's right. *Much like a cornered animal BITES and SCRATCHES and SWINGS madly at ALL THAT IT SEES,* so too did **they all decide** that *now* is the time to get everyone *pouring out of their homes* so that *everyone that they have ever ruled over* **""go down with them""**. And by giving this a polarized and divisive ""Right v/s Left"" narrative here as they've all always done (and by using Elon's previously built appeal towards the right-wing folks to their own benefit), they thought that NOW was the time indeed to *kill one and all.* Basically, the ""if we're going down then we are going down *with you""* approach. So by getting you all out NOW, it is super-easy to [**co-ordinate some crazy ass mass shootings**](https://qanon.pub/data/media/8ab5a5a0c1b486bb298c3011a9d88c52b511755f5e30a0d9dbc3ecb3e159aa25.png) like they've always done before.  

Also notable here is the fact that the elites are **REQUIRED BY DIVINE LAW** to **always state** their **true** intentions in some way, shape, or form here in front of the masses. Which is why you see them doing all of that predictive programming and [**hand-signs**](https://i.redd.it/q6n3qv8e8ns41.png) and all of that shit [**all over the internet**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/5e/e1/ba5ee165345bdcf7149f9c2d90a5d549.jpg) for [**all to see**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a1/29/11a12931d039c27f965fde5b4b013051.png). Which is why you will now be able to see our dear friend Elon Musk sporting a display picture that says [**Deus Ex Machina**](https://i.imgur.com/SXCiC1q.png). For the uninitiated, that means, and I quote [**the Oxford Dictionary here**](https://i.imgur.com/itWfnja.png) as saying

https://www.vox.com/2018/8/8/17657800/qanon-reddit-conspiracy-data

Late on a recent Thursday night, a Reddit user posted a comment in a forum (or subreddit) devoted to the game Magic: The Gathering about how the company that makes the game is hiring with diversity in mind — and how that was ruining the quality of its cards.

Then he went to another subreddit, /r/TheRedPill, a men’s rights community known for its misogyny. He posted a comment saying our society lets gay and transgender people and women get away with sexual harassment.

His next stop is what’s most interesting.

He went to /r/greatawakening, the community that drives the QAnon conspiracy theory, a pro-Trump theory that posits that the president is at the center of a fight against a pedophilia ring run by Democrats. Enough of these people have shown up at Trump rallies wearing Q T-shirts — in reference to the persona at the core of this conspiracy theory — that a reporter had to ask White House press secretary Sarah Sanders whether President Donald Trump supported QAnon. (She dodged the question.)

The user we followed is deeply familiar with the culture of /r/greatawakening, because that’s where he’s been most active in recent months. And late that night, he went into a thread about the Clinton Foundation funding a pedophile ring and said he finds it “impossible to believe that this is all an elaborate hoax.”

It’s an outrageous claim, but it’s a core belief of QAnon conspiracy theorists. And it gets more outrageous: A key part of the QAnon narrative is that Donald Trump and Robert Mueller are working together to unearth a high-profile, Democrat-run pedophile ring.

This user’s late-night journey might sound like the meandering internet history of a lost, bigoted man.

But when we analyzed the participants of the /r/greatawakening — one of the main gathering places for QAnon supporters — we found that he’s a quintessential QAnon participant.

We were able to glean characteristics of this community by writing a computer program to analyze every single user who has commented on /r/greatawakening. From there, we looked at what other subreddits outside of /r/greatawakening these users participate in.

We found that most participants are relatively casual conspiracy theorists. Their interest in /r/greatawakening largely comes from their enthusiastic support for Trump. (There’s also a handful of Bernie Sanders supporters mixed in.) Their interests coalesce around things like video games, cryptocurrency, men’s rights, and martial arts. Although Reddit doesn’t ask for demographic data, it’s not a reach to say they are predominantly white men.

But here’s the kicker: An astoundingly small number of people produce the majority of the content. About 200 users account for a quarter of the forum’s comments. These people are clearly conspiracy theorists who believe they are investigators unearthing the truth, and they spend almost all their time on Reddit investigating these theories.

Another 700 users account for the next quarter of comments. The user we followed at the top of this story is among these people. They are active in /r/greatawakening but also spend time on other subreddits.

Nearly everyone else in the subreddit — the 11,000 commenters and 42,000 lurkers — are just along for the ride.

Who or what is Q?
But let’s take a step back: Who or what is Q?

Q is the mysterious persona who set this conspiracy theory in motion — someone who claims to have “Q-level” security clearance, which is how he can drop all these hints about the “true nature” of what’s happening in Washington. (Most commenters used the pronoun “he,” so we’re using that here.)

It’s tempting to speculate on who Q actually is. Many think there’s no one Q and it’s instead a group of people. Others think it’s John F. Kennedy Jr. A BuzzFeed report argues that it’s actually leftist trolls. But it could also be just a teenage dungeon master who thinks this is his magnum opus. No one really knows (though my bet is that it’s someone who’s not all that interesting).

This community, however, has turned an internet conspiracy theory into a live-action role-playing game. They are the main characters — except they don’t think it’s a game; they believe this conspiracy is real.

Who are QAnon supporters, according to their Reddit activity?
When we looked at the /r/greatawakening community as a whole, we found that the biggest overlap was with the pro-Trump community, /r/the_donald. The next biggest overlap was with /r/conspiracy, which has recently taken a pro-Trump bent.

There are many interesting nooks and crannies to this data set. For example, there’s overlap with men’s rights groups, gaming groups, cryptocurrency groups, and other conspiracy theory groups.

But there’s clearly a divide between hardcore QAnon users and everyone else.

Most people subscribed to /r/greatawakening don’t post anything. That’s in line with how most online communities work.

It’s the hardcore users who drive this conspiracy theory — and they believe it is their patriotic duty to investigate this conspiracy.

QAnon’s hardcore followers: the bakers
This conspiracy theory is compelling because of its participatory nature.

The QAnon conspiracy theory started when a 4chan poster — who said he had “Q-level” security clearance, and came to be known on 4chan and Reddit as “Q” — posted cryptic phrases and prompted people to investigate.

One of his first posts hinted that Hillary Clinton had been detained because Trump knew he had to remove “criminally rogue elements.” Q also told readers to follow former Clinton staffer Huma Abedin and to figure out why billionaire George Soros donated all his money recently.

Eventually, using Q’s hints, the community decided that the tumult of Donald Trump’s presidency was just a cover — that Trump, in fact, had everything under control. The users decided Trump was actually working with Mueller, instead of being investigated by him, to take down thousands of pedophiles. (My colleague Jane Coaston has a great explainer on this.)

But Q doesn’t say this outright. He only leaves “bread crumbs” for people to follow, and it’s the community’s job to piece them together. That’s why the subreddit’s users call themselves “bakers” — they’re pulling together the crumbs. Their investigation has led them to compare themselves to the Boston Globe reporters who reported on pedophile priests in the Catholic Church.

For most of these hardcore users, their Reddit activity circles around QAnon and other conspiracies.

They spend most of their time peddling conspiracy theories in politically oriented subreddits, including /r/politics. But they also spend time exploring other conspiracies in places like /r/MollieTibbetts, where redditors “investigate” the disappearance of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts.

Still, most of their time is spent on /r/greatawakening.

The top 200 commenters rarely post to other subreddits. About 80 percent of their comments are on /r/greatawakening and another 10 percent on /r/the_donald.

One user has posted more than 650 comments about QAnon. The user often takes “Q drops” and reposts them on /r/greatawakening, reaping a great amount of “karma” (Reddit’s points) along the way.

Another top commenter makes elaborate diagrams that look almost like caricatures of a conspiracy theorist’s diagram, but the community eats it up:

In other words, for all the attention they’ve gotten, there are relatively few people who seriously participate in this game.

QAnon’s less engaged commenters: the casuals
The user at the top of this piece is on the edge between a superuser and a casual user. But his Reddit activity falls more in line with the latter.

These casual users are what give QAnon its appearance of size and growth. They know the conspiracy theory, but they spend most of their time on other subreddits. QAnon is a side activity.

They scan as typical Trump supporters, with large overlaps in subreddit activity in /r/the_donald and /r/DrainTheSwamp. There is also a big overlap with /r/conspiracy, but on a per-account basis, only about one in 50 comments are on these conspiracy forums. (We only looked at users who posted between five and 30 comments in /r/greatawakening.)

In short, they aren’t a homogeneous group, other than their interest in Trump. They don’t all hang out in the same subreddits.

But there are some common themes in the subreddits they do hang out in:

When you look at this data, and dive into their comment histories, it’s hard not to think that many of these users profile as men who enjoy feeling like they know more than everyone else.

As one QAnon supporter told Vice, “It’s fun because we know before it’s going to happen a lot of times. Think of it: When things are happening, we got a smirk on our face — hehe — Q told us.”

The QAnon community is small, but it has powerful boosters who legitimize it
The core QAnon community is relatively small, and it would normally be a fringe conspiracy theory group that doesn’t get much attention outside the depths of internet forums. Even people like alt-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, who promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, has pushed back against QAnon. (Posobiec said he would debunk QAnon.)


But it has been thrust into the national spotlight because some prominent figures feed into the frenzy. It has gotten attention from celebrities like Roseanne Barr and former MLB pitcher Curt Schilling. It has also gotten huge bursts of attention via top conspiracy theorists Alex Jones and Sean Hannity. (Media Matters has a good rundown of all the people who have promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory.) In addition, Q supporters have shown up in decent numbers at Trump rallies and garnered quite a bit of media attention.

Sure, Q might be a leftist troll or a bored teenager. But the reality is that the president of the United States is not only prone to believing conspiracy theories but surrounds himself with people who peddle conspiracy theories. And he has used the office of the presidency to legitimize conspiracy theories and lies.

At a recent Trump rally, the president appeared to point at a family wearing Q T-shirts during a rally. To be clear, Trump could’ve been motioning to any number of things. But the gesture seemed to affirm to the QAnon community that Trump was in on this. “Never thought I would have hope restored like it is now. Its almost surreal,” one user posted on /r/greatawakening.

After all, if the president supports what you believe in, then how can it not be real?

Correction: We previously listed /t/TopMindsOfReddit as a conspiracy subreddit, but several users pointed out it’s actually about making fun of posts on subreddits like /r/greatawakening. This hints there’s some trolling happening from other subreddits.

It is my opinion that Qanon is a psyop that is connected in some way to the current administration , or at the very least individuals with influence in the current administration.  This has been proven due to the constant subtle synchronicities that are usually just numbers or phrases that seem to be meant to convey this to the Q collective.

My reason for this post is that I am witnessing rhetoric by Q followers that shows their support for US imperialism throughout the world.  Most recently against Venezuela in the name of ""drug trafficking""  I am also seeing a buildup in anti China propaganda that imho could pull us into WW3.

All I am asking is for Q followers to be ""free thinkers"" and ""use logic"" in these times.  Dont let a narrative that never offers any real evidence pull you into being a war monger.  I would LOVE it if the ""deep state"" was exposed and all the children were freed. but until the evidence presents itself search out all facts even if they are outside your own echo chamber.

QAnon claims to be military. US MILITARY.

This in itself is a massive claim. The fact that the fake and corrupt MSM always fails to mention that Q claims to be US military is a dead giveaway they don't want the truth to come out.

If Q is US military, one would logically assume Donald Trump, the COMMANDER IN CHIEF, is aware of an ongoing military operation, REGARDLESS if he says he ""doesn't know anything about QAnon"".

Why won't and why hasn't the media asked Trump about the fact Q is claiming to be US military?

Here is a perfect example of a question the media doesn't want to ask:

~~~~~~

**Mr President, for three years now, an anonymous online user who goes by the name of Q, has been posting information/questions/links/pictures for people to look at and disect.**

**Q or QAnon, claims to be part of the United States military and based off of the information Q has posted, there is essentially an internal power struggle right now between what appears to be Patriots inside government/military and a large syndicate of corrupt actors.**

**Q has specially stated that this is no longer Republican vs Democrat, more so good vs evil.**

**Mr. President, are you working with the United States military to take down this so called ""deep state""? Is QAnon a United States military intelligence operation communicating with the public? There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans who believe this. Not only Americans, there are large numbers of people from virtually every single country on the planet who believe QAnon. Is this real Mr President?**

~~~~~~

Seems quite odd the media won't go down this route. All they do, all they've done, is just bash on Q, the people who follow it, and ridicule and mock it at every turn. They don't report on the contents of the drops, they don't investigate any claims made from the Q sceen, they won't seriously press Trump on the matter.

Top this off with the literal HUNDREDS of shoutouts Trump has given Q on twitter, seems pretty obvious at this point QAnon is most definitely a highly coordinated and planned military operation. Anyone denying this are useful idiots.

So I've got questions.

What about draining the swamp?

Pardoning Assange and Snowden?

Or the thousand other things Qanon follower believed to be happening.

Is it over or what's next? Will people say 'he's still president in secret' or is he going to start lobbying and or start his own party?

I'm curious and really interested in some Qanon folks to explain how they can still believe in everything.

From where I stand people should simply acknowledge that they've been played. And if they have  not..... How? Could someone explain to me why people still think he's about to drop anything?",conspiracy,QAnon

UPDATE 2: I am not one to complain but yo... the Reddit Vote Manipulation is REAL.  Frustrating too.

NOTE: I used to be very wary of the ""Ra"" channelings but now that I have found the people approaching it scientifically with good morals and nothing but good intentions, we see the result.  TRUTH is the result.  Amazing.

how about starting with clearing up how human history really went (re: extra terrestrials in our history).

Why don't we ask them directly?

To start, what was Egypt all about? 

Answer:

This book is mindblowing: https://www.llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_book_1.pdf

RECOMMENDED: To browse and click on many names at the top of the above link and read, Jesus, Muhammad, even Hitler and Eisenhower.  Fascinating.

wingmakers.us (real)

wingmakers.com (truth mixed with lies, the site was taken over and replaced, thank God for Fred Burk SAVING the entire site and copying it over to wingmakers.us or I would not be here typing this.)

When you see how the interviews were changed, and WHAT was changed, you can see the CLEAR coverrup (damage control).  They knew the bulk of it was out of the hat so they decided to change the interviews by DELETING huge sections and replacing with LIES.  By changing names and even distances to Star Systems.  Weird, no?

NOTE: all over the web, youtube, everywhere, you will have assholes (agents and fucking morons) talking about ""Dr.Neruda"" and interview 3, 4 or 5. These interviews were NEVER RELEASED and the ones on youtube are quite obviously FULL. OF. LIES. it pushes new age horseshit and lies about some ""Grand Portal"". The original interviews below SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. No New Age garbage. Zero mention of Grand Portal or Ascending to higher dimensions, that is all new age garbage.

WINGMAKERS IS THE REAL DEAL.

Interview One: WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews1changes.pdf

Interview Two: WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews2changes.pdf

note: when the name was changed to ""Dr. Neruda"" it was the CIA taking control, these 2 pdf's are what remains of this truth disclosure from around 1999-2000 and then 2001 happened and the WingMakers was buried.

Now we have someone running Wingmakers.com who is NOT the original poster. They have changed everything on the sight (CENSORED) and literally turned it into wholesale (everything used to be ofc free).

They've commercialized an alien contact episode to hide it.

Here's where it gets really messed up:

In the original interviews someone named ""Mahu Nahi"" is mentioned one single time. He is said to be the leader of the ""Corteum"" (AKA annunaki) which is supposed to be an alien race that the US government has made a treaty with (think Eisenhower in the 1950's). I believe the Corteum is disinformation and he was instead referring to the Draco (reptilians).

So now we have someone named ""James Mahu"" who mysteriously took over the site wingmakers.com and wiped the original content from the web.

If you search for his instagram, he calls himself ""James Mahu - Mahu Nahi"". According to the legit interviews, and if it is true, James Mahu aka mahunahi is quite literally the leader of the ""corteum"" aka Draco. ROFL.

He claims he ""updated the website"" as per the emails exchanges he had with Fred Burk that Fred published on his website.  But it is all a lie as Fred shows us; they CHANGED everything, added in Theosophy and New Age Luciferian trash to it, added as a goal to ""ascend"" to higher states and all this HORSESHIT. What used to be there, is truly amazing.

How amazing? So amazing that this info still stands all by itself, just like Phil Schneider and Fritz Springmeier.  Some very special people.

Been researching for like 20 hours straight and am unable to prove WingMakers as being a hoax - this is REAL - and is the biggest coverrup going. The one with the BIGGEST implications. Don't believe me? Try to prove me wrong, I dare you.

When Phil Schneider was killed in the 1990's there was 130 confirmed deep underground military bases in the USA alone and 1400+ worldwide.

So many of these bases exist now? If they are so fucking huge, what the  is going on down in those bases?

When Qanon made references to the matrix and people being fed on or whatever I am convinced this is the DUMB's and the fact they have made alien contact long ago and have done an agreement with the Draco to literally farm humans and feed them to Draco.

(SIDENOTE: we also know like ancient places in mexico and whatnot used to worship serpent gods and do sacrifices to them, clearly just more annunaki crap, and look at our elites now, luciferians doing sacrifices.  Is lucifer just made up crap so the Draco can get their meals? How far is this from the truth, not sure.. or how close?).

You wonder why they would eat kids and shit? Who taught them to do this? Who told them to go all in?

Could it be the Draco? We are not being told the full story.

But its NOT ALL BAD. Read below to find out, the good guys are here, and from my 2 days of almost nonstop research I am more and more convinced that Donald Trump is working with the Labyrinth Group and that Qanon IS this group.

Have you guys seen these videos on youtube of ""black magick"" having these ""magicians"" going and making shit appear out of nowhere? I saw one where an asian dude made an entire, GIGANTIC, loaf of bread appear out of his hand - out of thin air, sitting in the middle of a restaurant.

The Luciferians allowed this to go into the open, they allowed this guy to display LERM as a ""miracle"" or as they call it ""magic"", for 10 million normies et all to gaze upon:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3YLneFhr60

They do it using LERM (Light Encoded Reality Matrix) just one technology/science that they hide from us.

Yesterday I spent 12 hours researching only the WingMakers.

Al Bielek during the Philadelphia Experiment actually ended up being sent to the year 2800 and HE MET THE WINGMAKERS.

They are a HUMAN CIVILIZATION from 750 years in our future who discovered time travel.

They went back to the year 800 A.D. and buried ""time capsule"" sites which include AMAZING music, art, poetry and philosophy. Absolutely none of this is Dark Shit. No occult. No new age. No ""worship the light"" horseshit.

Not only that, but its indicated in the original literature that 6 other sites (7 total) - 7 trumpets? - needed to be found to fully comprehend the Time Capsule and receive the tech for BST (Blank Slate Technology) which is actually a technical way of saying Time Travel.

this is the real deal.

The only content remaining uncensored of this amazing discovered is housed at wingmakers.us which is a site controlled by a true Patriot named ""Fred Burk"" - thank you so much Fred!!!

Guys...

Who are ""The WingMakers"" ?

What is ""The Labyrinth Group"" ?

we are not alone on this planet..

youtube.com/watch?v=xFpes9qWMj4

youtube.com/watch?v=4hxBNJRVoTs&t=4s


WHO IS: The Labyrinth Group?

WHAT IS: The Ancient Arrow Project?

Within the ACIO, there are 14 distinct levels of security clearance. Those who are at level 12 and above are aware of the Corteum/Anunnaki Technology Transfer Program (TTP). >>>There are only 7 who have level 14 clearance. <<<   [Less than 10] - [Qanon]

is Qanon = Labyrinth Group ?

further notes: Phil Schneider was good friends with Al Bielek.

Bielek was involved with the Philadelphia experiment along with his brother Duncan. (think Nicolas Tesla).

Bielek is actually the guy who convinced Phil to come out and do public discourses (he was killed for this months later).

Bielek, as a result of Phi. Experiment. was sent to the year 2800 and met with the WingMakers (no shit!)

Can you people see why this is so huge? Tesla, Trump, Bielek, Schneider.

Phil Schneiders Dad, Oscar Schneider, went on many trips just before World War 2 broke out and even 1 trip just as the war broke out. Oscar would return home with a German, the German would stay at their house 2-3 weeks and eventually just blend into society and dissapear.

YEP, you heard that right, he was bringing NAZI's over from Germany! 

NAZI SCIENTISTS TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

Bieleks father was the Head Medical Tech involved for the Philadelphia Experiment. They discovered time travel,  BY ACCIDENT, of course

if you are not yet freaked out and want more Draco evidence (WARNING, its some disturbing stuff):

youtube.com/user/THEYLIVE2012/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid

CONTINUED:

If you search the web you can find people in India talking about ACIO positions and it states clearly in the original interview transcripts that the ACIO has offices in India, USA and one other country.

Al Bielek telling all about Philadelphia Experiment and how he traveled to the year 2800 and met the WingMakers. 
youtube.com/watch?v=dYE1Oady6Qo&list=PLmqTgSUpRWNvDJSiwue_B_1UB4rSeQaHE

My research indicates he was part of not only Phi. Exp. but also the Montauk Project AND NOT ONLY THAT, he was one of their PROGRAMMERS of what is dubbed ""The Montauk Boys"" <---STRANGER THINGS [MK ULTRA]

For anyone interested listen here and listen CLOSELY. Do you know the name ""Fritz Springmeier"" ?

Fritz Springmeier knew Phil Schneider very very well.

Now let that sink in a moment.

Yes you heard right. Fritz held this information for over 20 years secret. He freaked the fuck out when they found Phil dead. Phil was an MK ULTRA victim and had multiple personalities - part of him breaking free of black projects and going rogue was him trying to not only tell the truth - but to break free of his ACTUAL programming. He was very high up in NATO when he left - head of their top GEOLOGY Department (THINK DEEP UNDERGROUND FUCKING BASES). THIS MAN KNEW ALL, AND TOLD ALL.

Al Bielek found out years later that his real name is Edward Cameron.  And that Duncan Cameron is his brother.  MK Ultra.  Multiple Personalities, like Phil Schneider.  These guys were victims of the MK Ultra program EVEN AS SCIENTISTS IMPLEMENTING THE BLACK PROJECTS.  Now thats twisted. 

OK? Ready for more?

This is a top secret Military wing of the NSA - called ACIO.

in the ACIO, they have created a subgroup of only the top clearances called the Labyrinth Group (12x clearance and above).

There is a leader of the Group and he is known only as Fifteen (15).

The 'whistleblower' who dropped this info on the net in 1997 is a 12x cleared linguistic expert called in to help on the discovery of the Ancient Arrow Project site in New Mexico.

What they discovered was legit.

Consisted of an underground tunnel complex that was perfect, not a pebble anywhere, everything perfect, the site was perfectly preserved for 800 years. Smooth surfaces and they later discovered that they had used some sort of Sound Tech. to carve out the stones (Harmonics, if you find the perfect Harmonic Frequency of a substance (like rock) you can fuck with the matter, its much like the drills they use for the D.U.M.B's as Schneider talks about - he was an expert GEOLOGIST working on black projects).

Only dust was found covering the smooth walls, ceiling and floor because the site is 1,200 years old!

It was carbon dated to have been put there in the year 800 A.D. by time travellers from our current year --> 2800 (from our current timeline I should say). A group who calls themselves the WingMakers.

They found 23 chambers (humans have 23 chromosomes).

Each chamber consisted of 2 pieces of Poetry, one Huge Painting on the wall and an Audio Music Recording corresponding to the chamber. In the 23rd chamber they found an OPTICAL DISC (like a CD-rom) with hieroglyphics on it. It took them 4 years to figure out how to read its contents. It contained 8,100 pages of writings, philosophy and music.

People who viewed this original material as it was dropped on the web (the first and second chamber material was available completely as the translations were done for these 2 chambers and they knew what music and philosophy went to it. It changed peoples lives.

But it gets even more crazy... the linguist, after much studying of their ancient language, started to discover that the entire site is a time capsule. The entire site itself, is a language, its a message.

Now let me tell you, during the interview he made a ball of yarn appear out of thin air for the reporter, just like that, didnt give a fuck.

Then the woman is losing her shit, shes like... wtf? OK can u make a million dollars appear? hes like ""yep, I can"". totally fuckin dead serious hes being... she starts like trying to reason why he should make it appear, how it would help her, essentially shes freaking out.

So she calms down a bit and figures that because she will have to hide away a while after releasing this crazy info, she could certainly use 10,000 bucks it would be really helpful (shes being completely earnest) so the guy is like ""yah sure makes sense"" and literally makes dozens of 100 bills appear out of thin air for her. SHE STARTS LOSING HER SHIT.

This is LERM. This is Light Encoded Reality Matrix - its a SCIENCE the Elite know and use. Creating money out of thin air?

These movies hollywood makes, inception, in the interview they talk about ""intervention points"" relating to BST technology which is TIME TRAVEL.

Certain races in the galaxy already possess BST but they do not use it on us.

There is no real big threat, as per this 12x scientist, from our current galaxy./

But there is a prophecy that is Top Secret, sumerian documents, that they have about an invasion in the future.

An invasion from an Alien race NOT FROM OUR GALAXY

A hivemind like alien race that utilizes essentially drones, like a big fuckin ant colony, and they are a COLONIZATION race.

Singleminded colonization.

Now stop right there - has anyone ever played or seen STARCRAFT?

We are the Terran.

The Protoss is the Annunaki AKA Corteum whom is working the humans to fight against....

THE ZERG.

The Zerg is this hive mind alien race that the ELITE WELL KNOW is prophesied to come and attack us.

SPACE FORCE?

THREAT FROM SPACE?

know what I think?

Labyrinth Group figured out that the attack was delayed to a future date and instead they focused fully on getting Trumper into power.  If Hillary had gotten in, who fuckin knows.   

Remember the footage of Hillary coughing out some green globular object during a speech? That doesnt happen to human beings, as we all know, no matter how much the talking heads on TV talk until their blue in the face (lie until blue in the face). The footage of them ripping a kids face off: her and Huma? Humans do not do that guys.

Frazzled.rip for all the normies who have no clue what I'm talking about -> PizzaGate.

FAKE NEWS is a term that appeared at the SAME TIME as PIZZAGATE.

When Trump refers to FAKE NEWS -> He is talking to the Media and saying ""I KNOW WHAT FAKE NEWS IS COVERING UP FOR YOU, SO I WILL USE THIS TERM BACK ON YOU"".

These are not even human beings.  Refer to much of my Draco (annunaki) evidence pointed to on youtube, the AZUR AZEEN channel as well as marinodelfino will have much good info.

KNOW WHAT I REALLY THINK? I think Trump is a good alien working with the humans (Terrans) to stop these psychopaths and end their feeding of our kids to the bad reptilians ALL THE WHILE planning to fight the incoming Zerg invasion.

Remember Trump tweeting HIMSELF AS PEPE THE FROG?

Frog = Reptile.

He is telling us that he has allied himself, and probably many other good aliens, to fight not only the bad reptilian/other aliens who are against the humans, but also preparing for this incoming invasion. I don't know what other terms to use so fuck it, use starcraft labels.

Guys... I could have much of this wrong, but you know what? It's logical and fits. How can Trump have so much energy when he eats McDonalds and Drinks diet fuckin coke, doing no exercise and just going nonstop. HE AINT HUMAN! LOL< Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. I don't think it matters. Human or Alien, if he loves GOOD. HAS GOOD MORALS. WANTS US TO THRIVE? I say... fuck it. LET THE TRUTH BE HEARD.

SPACE FORCE uses the STAR TREK logo =)

NOTE: For any who want to research this topic, you may note that all available LEGITIMATE footage of reptilian (draco, annunaki) on the web has been manipulated via view and upvote count but more importantly, ALL QUALITY IS 480p or lower and THIS IS BY DESIGN. I am not new to this subject, just only recently found out about wingmakers and ACIO. It was a well hidden - I found it by accident. The Hoax garbage led me to the legit stuff, so a huge CIA failure on that front, HAHAHA!

For those having a hard time reading (or just to pwn agents) ANYTHING with ""Neruda"" in it, and ANYTHING talking about ""Grand Portals"" and ""Ascension"" bullshit and saying we are slaves in a fake reality ARE REPEATING LUCIFERIAN HORSESHIT AND IT IS TO BE IGNORED.

The truth is contained at wingmakers.us ONLY

period.

1930 - Einstein is brought from Germany over to the USA.

Working at CAL tech.

Working at the Institute of Advanced Studies.

Working alongside good buddy Nicolas Tesla

Keep in mind this is all ocurring BEFORE the CIA exists (which was founded in 1947). This was all being conducted as a research project initially.

They were working on an invisibility project for the Military, at Roosevelts direction, he KNEW Tesla was brilliant. I mean they fucking brought over Albert Einstein so it sounds like some serious shit.

Continued until 1940, Al Bielek working on this project alongside his brother Duncan. in January of 1940 a successful test was done in Brooklyn naval yard. The ship was rendered invisible when the equipment was turned on and nobody was on board the ship, for safety. At this point Navy classified it, everybody had to get clearances.

1941 till 1942 project was moved to the back of a shipyard in Philadelphia.

late 1890's tesla makes a coil that breaks a power plant - but its also said he made contact with Another Civilization Not From Our Planet. At this point JP Morgan contacts tesla.

Tesla worked for RCA from 1919 till 1939 as their Chief Engineer. The lie on google saying he was a recluse tries to hide this - yet it was one of the busiest times in Tesla's life IRL.

Tesla worked for RCA from 1919 till 1939 as their Chief Engineer. The lie on google saying he was a recluse tries to hide this - yet it was one of the busiest times in Tesla's life IRL.
Held a retirement party for Tesla in 1939 at Cherryhill, NJ.
People since have tried to trace the history of Tesla and RCA but have not been able to find them.
He decided to use the name Nicolas Turbil for some reason at RCA.
Records were later destroyed and Bielek is not sure really why.
In 1931 he was working on the “Free-Energy” business (wow)
Took an auto, ripped out the engine, put in an electric motor and a “little black box” which was essentially free energy that he had developed around the turn of the century.  Jp Morgan wanted no part, as we know.
Put the black box in the Dashboard and plugged it in, and it drove the 75 HP motor of the car (electric).
Self powering car, in 1931. Using free energy in the air.
This secret apparently died with him. Japanese tried to recreate what he did, many years later, and they said “Tesla did it better than us and nobody knows how he did it”.
He developed particle beam weapon and tried to sell to US government. 
Nobody wanted to buy it, not USA, not Canada, but RUSSIA did buy it (rofl). They bought it for 25k cash lol
1935-1936, while working on 'Project Invisibility'

He needed money so bad that he sold that tech to them so cheap.
Eventually the US Govt did provide Tesla a stipend because he was needing money.

He was anything but a recluse.

He knew Roosevelt from years prior (World War 1)

When he met roosevelt again in 1931, he told him about some of the things he had been up to (projects).

He told him he had a good track record and had many projects under his name (successful).

He had 2 laboratories and one of those labs was contained in the twin towers of the Waldorf Astoria hotel.

(Reminds me of ASTORs of Titanic fame, ones against the Fed Reserve who were killed).

Had secret laboratory in New Jersey as well.

He also worked at institute of Advanced Study. Princeton.

Al Bielek worked there also, he asked if they had records of Tesla (this was later after Nikola died).

He was told that nobody who actually worked there and received a paycheque, had files on them kept.

All they had was a folder on Tesla. Contained a telegram (sent from Institute to New York (assume Waldorf Astoria)) announcing Nikola Tesla had died on 7th Jan, 1943 and announcing the plans for his funeral.  This was the only thing in the file.

Back to 1930's.  He had an incredible and impeccable reputation – he never married his whole life.

Tesla was friends with a guy named HILBERT from Germany who was a brilliant mathematician who essentially figured out there was multiple dimensions using Math. 

Tesla learned all his formulas and was fascinated.

This stuff was brought over to USA by Van Neumann and showed to Tesla (institude advanced study princeton)

This was all used in the experiments (Philadelphia exp)

Electricity and current flow, in electrical circuits.

There are elctric fields, magnetic fields, ever heard of “Gravity Field” ?

Mass of the planet determines str. Of Gravity field = incorrect.

Gravity Field is what was used to create a means of access to the time field.

Not many people outside the HARDCORE scientific field understand that time is not an illusion but is in fact a FIELD.  (measurable).

(Al Bielek – whos a smart fucker – is trying to break it down how this all works for us (laymen)).

He says Gravity Field, Electrical field and Magnetic field all form basically an equilateral triangle (they all work together). 

At 3 points of the triangle. 
If you interconnect these 3 fields using electronics, which they took many many years to figure out how this all works and how to build the hardware and setup these fields working together..

you setup electronics and electronic means, to properly interact together, it develops (gives access to?) the Time Field.

This is a small localized field, It depends how much power you put into it. You can access it, and manipulate the time field, for effects which as local.
Think about a donut.  A torroidal structure resembling a donut.
Time is a closed loop, a closed circuit.

There is no beginning and there is no ending (infinity chan logo? 8Chan)
There is a point where you can say it is PLUS or MINUS infinity but this is a mathematical concept that perhaps doesn't have any feeling in reality, you might say there is a beginning and ending and you can go through that point.

This is a concept, Alpha and Omega, 
We are at some point in the time field.

Think of a line around the edge of this donut, this is the reality edge of time, the 3 vectors.  Time can be measured with a clock.  Time has another aspect, another vector called T2, which is at right angles to the linear flow.  It controls T1, they combine for the time field.

In you go to T2 and affects things there, it affects T1.

They created a time field.

If you can create a field large enough to surround an object, you can hide the ship basically.  This field affects time around the object, with enough power, can make the field bigger.

The field creates a rotation around the object (torroidal field) which causes so that light can pass through the field, the object is invisble essentially.
The light is being reflected back by the time field.

No return of light, no image.  Sounds simple, but its really not.
If you make the index of refraction of the ship = 1 , then it is invisible.
It bends light.

Tesla involved in this all the up until March 1942. When they heard he made the little ship small, Roosevelt contacted him and asked him to do it with a big ship, and everything was classified.  It was moved to Philadelphia.

Tesla had Einstein as a consultant.

Many brilliant people involved.

Al Bielek had been sent out, with his brother Duncan, out on a ship with a home dock being PHILADELPHIA in 1940 ship called the Pennsylvania arrived to pearl harbor as ship was due for overhaul in Oct 1941.

So they went to Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, and then left to go on leave for 2 months.  On Dec 5th, 1941 they were supposed to head back to Pearl Harbour but they were intercepted and told not to go back because there would be an attack on the island and the people at Princeton did not want them  on the island then.

And 2 days later the attack happened,  They had known for 2 months, everybody on the island, that an attack was coming from Japan they just didn't know when.  This lie (surprise attack) was ofc used to get AMERICA into the War.

As they worked back in Princeton in 1941 on Philadelphia experiment, on a huge battleship, they installed the equipment in the ship and began doing testing but Tesla was worried that the coils and equipment would be too powerful for the sailors who would be aboard if they were to ever try and use the equipment.  Tesla tried to tell them to put back the date for the test but was told

DERP MERP THERE IS A WAR ON MR. TESLA, THE DATE IS FIRM.

But on the night before the first test he went around and sabotaged some equipment so the test would fail the next day.

At this point, Tesla left the project (wow)

Van Neuymann was assigned to replace him.

First thing he did was try to figure out what had gone wrong – it did not take him long to figure out what had gone wrong.
He wanted to redesign the system.
He decided he wanted to scrap the analog system – he decided instead of continuous raditation field he wanted to use instead a PULSE field.  It was more efficient in his view.
Van Neuymann was a very strange man, he had the ability to not only conceptualize his opinion but also build the hardware to make his work, brilliant.
Good at Math, Good Engineer.
He decided they needed not only a Pulse System, but that they needed a ship specifically designed from the ground up, for this project.
(Bielek now describes the various modifications that Van Neuymann requested of the Navy Ship Builders at their site, Newark Shipyard).
Asked them to provide a hollow gun turret, leave it all gutted out.
Ship was ready in summer of 1942.
DE-173 (USS Eldridge) was transferred to Philadelphia Navy Yard to install some very heavy equipment.

They were using Megawatts of Power (Diesel Generator) @ 1.6 Mhz
Alot of heavy equipment was fitted on the ship.

Here Al stops talking and mentions how the Black Budgets are always 50 and even sometimes 100 years ahead in technology.

What he is saying to the idiot normies is to fucking undo what you think is possible, completely WIPE IT CLEAN because YOU DON't KNOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE.

Finnally in the summer of 1943 the first of the total of two tests began.
There was a Capt Harrison who was kind of the head coordinator for the testing – he was the first Native American to ever get to the rank of Capt in the Navy.

He was observing the invisble ship for 20 mins while the equipment was turned on but saw a problem – he noticed that the waterline which should show at least an outline of where the ship should be – was ALSO INVISIBLE.
So he ordered they turn off the equipment.


They confirmed during the test that the ship was also completely invisible to Radar.

Also noted that much of the crew that on the upper deck complained of “mental issues”, as Tesla had warned.

July 1943 first test with the volunteer crew, after much training and preparation.

The first test  the ship kind of faded out of view like special FX in movies, but REAL. Not an illusion.

It was invisible to the eye and also invisible to the radar.

It was mandated by the very head of the Navy, an Admiral, that the tests be completed by 12 August or that they were to drop the test.  Highly unusual and we do not know why this happened, they never got the answer till the late 1980's.

With a lot of research they did find out eventually but it would take way too long to explain now.

They worked around the clock as a result, on the project.

The reasoning was that at night in a convoy you must be able to see the ship somewhat with optical sight, because of dangers with own allied ships.  What they really wanted was the radar invisibility.

By 9 August 1943, when they were getting ready for the final test, everybody started getting this very uneasy, odd, queasy feeling.  Like something was wrong.

There was one crew member who almost bed ridden because he was so nervously thinking about a feeling of impending doom.

Comes the 12th of August, they had a final party the night before at the Blue Lagoon Bar.

They board the ship, it goes down the harbour, they have 3 observer ships nearby.

Set for the test.  At the apropriate hour – everything was turned on by radio link.

The ship became radar invisible, but you could still see the shop via a green fog – highly ionized ozone around the ship.  Producing a greenish fog, allowing them to optically see the ship.

But after 70 seconds, there was a blue flash of light, and suddenly everything dissapeared.  No more USS Eldridge.

No communication.  Nobody knew what happened, nobody had any concept of what was happening until the ship returned FOUR HOURS LATER at the same place in the harbour.

Usage: 72% firstname, 28% surname.
Jamisson [NERUDA] first name was found 31 times in 3 different countries.
Surname Jamisson is used at least 12 times in at least 2 countries. (USA,Australia)

""Jamisson Neruda"" why did the spooksters choose to use this particular name? what does it mean? could it connect to the actual whistleblower or reporter that dissapeared back in 1998-1999 ?

I'm 1 hour into The Matrix (1999) -> Don't forget this WingMakers stuff all became applicable again in 1994, that's when the rockslide occurred, and let me tell you that this movie is a GIGANTIC redpill on more than we thought.  Is fifteen = Neo aka The One ? Or a dramatized version of him.

I imagine the ""Agents"" as the CIA who are run by the cabal and surely contain tons of these Draco....

trippy stuff

It is very much recommended to go down the rabbit hole on this WingMaker material, and then rewatch The Matrix.

***

* Establishment Democrats will claim moral highground, and justify any action as necessary to prevent another Trump. Trump will, ironically, become the ultimate whataboutism.
* Establishment Republicans will distance themselves from Trump, and use Trump as the excuse to reject any of the populist demands from his base.
* The entire ""right"" will be blamed for these actions, including and possibly especially libertarians and constitutionalists.
* The progressive economic left will be shut out of decision-making for at least 4 years, on the basis that they can't give any ground to the ""fascists"".
* Critical Race Theory/social justice left will gain ground, blaming this on ""white supremacy"". 

***

* The idea of the people standing up to their government will be demonized.
* Conspiracy theorists in particular are likely to be targeted. *This* was one of the major reasons Qanon existed, so it can be used to smear anyone who puts the pieces together of how the world works.

[http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284)

The first sign involves 3 books. 2 are children's books that follow a boy named Baron Trump (Donald Trump had a fake name he use to use for press named John Baron or John Barron. His last child is also named Barron Trump). Baron Trump is very wealthy and lives in Castle Trump. He becomes bored with his luxurious lifestyle and ends up in Russia on an adventure that shapes the rest of his life. He is guided by a ""master of all masters"" named Don. He's on a quest to find a ""world within a world"" and the way to find it is told to him in a phrase that he keeps repeating to himself ""The people will tell thee"" He is repeatedly called ""the little Baron"". He has a such a great brain that he'll get so focused on things, he wouldn't notice his entire house is up in flames before it would be too late. He's quick to anger and show his power. He claims no Trump has ever surrendered and he never would either! The time of his death is uncertain too.

The last book of the 3 is called ""The Last President"" From the article:

>The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a ""state of uproar"" after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate.  
>  
>""The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,"" police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. ""Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years.""  
>  
>""The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,"" the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. ""Would the troops be in time to save it?  
>  
>The Last President doesn’t follow the same fictional narrative of Lockwood’s previous novels, though the links to Trump are once again abundantly clear. The president’s hometown of New York City is fearing the collapse of the republic in this book, also titled 1900, immediately following the transition of presidential power. Some Americans begin forming a resistance, protesting what was seen as a corrupt and unethical election process.

Strangely, he is an outsider candidate said to represent the “common man,” amid claims he will liberate the people from the bankers - an anti-establishment candidate as Mr Trump was billed as being.

**With the 2nd sign, here we have a TV show named Trackdown from 1958 that has a man named Walter Trump who promises to save people from the end of the world by building them a wall.**

The name of this specific episode is called THE END OF THE WORLD.

>There was a fifties Western television series (Trackdown) that had an episode called, “The End of the World.” In this episode, the series’ main character, Hoby Gilman (played by Robert Culp), visits a town that has been left shook.  
>  
>Why has this town been left in such a state of despair? The end of the world is coming of course.  
>  
>Why does this town believe this? A man actually named Walter Trump (played by Lawrence Dobkin) rose up out of nowhere and claimed that the world was going to end and that only HE had the power stop it.  
>  
>The people immediately fall in line and believe every word that he said. The outsider, Hoby, is the only one to call Trump out on his lies. How does Trump respond when Hoby calls him out?  
>  
>Trump actually threatens to sue him.  
>  
>The cops of course rally behind Trump. One of them (who is proven to be in on the scheme) asks Hoby rhetorically, “Can you prove he’s wrong?” He then says to Hoby, “It’s a lot safer to go his way than yours.”  
>  
>Hoby tries his luck with the local judge who meekly stands by and says there is nothing that can be done. He warns Hoby, “Anyone who tries to change their minds might get hurt. They’re not going to believe you.”  
>  
>The judge uses an apt metaphor though to at least shed some light on the situation.  
>  
>Judge: ""Can you prove that's what he really has in mind?""  
>  
>Hoby: ""It's obvious.""  
>  
>Judge: ""But can you prove it?""  
>  
>Hoby: ""What if I take him?""  
>  
>Judge: ""On what charge?""  
>  
>Hoby: ""Fraud""  
>  
>Judge: ""Don't you see, he's not exactly guilty of fraud.""  
>  
>Judge: ""I live here, I know these people pretty well. And right now, there's nothing in the world that can change their minds. And anyone who tries to is gonna end up getting hurt. They're not gonna listen.""  
>  
>Hoby: ""Well what if he starts a panic, it could happen.""  
>  
>Judge: ""Sure, you might as well try to spit out a forest fire.""  
>  
>Hoby: ""There's got to be some way to stop him.""  
>  
>Judge: ""If there is, I don't know it. It's a funny thing. When we were kids, we were all afraid of the dark. And we grew up, and we weren't afraid anymore but it's funny how a big lie can make us all kids again.""  
>  
>The story does not stop getting weirder from there. Walter Trump actually calls his device (which is simply a parasol) a “Wall” that will protect everyone from the outside danger.  
>  
>As soon as Trump gets a bit of power, he punished people monetarily for there being a single vocal doubter (Hoby). That frightened people into mob violence. Hoby is attacked for providing any resistance.  
>  
>When Hoby finally corners Trump, it’s revealed that our snake-oil salesman’s instincts are to buy people off. The idea clearly conveyed is that most people have been content to just sit back and take his payment in exchange for keeping quiet.  
>  
>Hoby continued to resist though and recognized that proving one lie was not enough. Everything had to be a lie for people to stop believing Trump.  
>  
>There’s not much in the way of analysis required here. There’s not much in the way of practical advice for people looking to resist Trump. Watching and breaking down this artifact was more just about appreciating the absolute bizarre coincidences. Enjoy?

Walter Trump in the TV show also makes reference to technology he has the deflect meteorites from space. With the announcement of the space force from Donald Trump, the prevailing idea is that it will be used to keep asteroids away from Earth.

# THE BIBLE CONNECTION

So with all of this laid out, what are these very specific signs telling us? In my opinion, it's telling is that Trump is the Antichrist. That doesn't mean the Bible is 100&#37; true or that things will happen exactly how it says it will happen in the Bible, just that we know the nature of which Trump is and it's not good.

Referring to Trump as ""the little Barron"" can only mean one thing in my mind. Trump is the little horn from the Book of Daniel. The last king who is not like the others, speaks boastfully and goes to war with the world. The last king of the last kingdom that is made of iron with clay mixed at the feet because it is divided and it has a mixture of people.

>**Daniel 2**  
>  
>**31** “Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. **32** The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, **33** its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. **34** While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. **35** Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.  
>  
>**36** “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. **37** Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; **38** in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.  
>  
>**39** “After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. **40** Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. **41** Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. **42** As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. **43** And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.  
>  
>**44** “In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. **45** This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.

So that last kingdom sounds a lot like America doesn't it?

>**Daniel 7**  
>  
>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrotedown the substance of his dream.  
>  
>**2** Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. **3** Four great beasts,each different from the others, came up out of the sea.  
>  
>**4** “The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.  
>  
>**5** “And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’  
>  
>**6** “After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.  
>  
>**7** “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.  
>  
>**8** “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.  
>  
>**11** “Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.  
>  
>“So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: **17** ‘The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. **18** But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’  
>  
>**19** “Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. **20** I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. **21** As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, **22** until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.  
>  
>**23** “He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.**24** The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. **25** He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.

The little horn is the last king of the last kingdom. The Last President. Ram horns were turned into trumpets in those days, Trump-Pence.

>A baron is a nobleman — a member of the aristocracy. Barons are also important, powerful businessmen with huge influence over their industries. In Britain, a baron is called “Lord,” but in the States, we call them “rich.”  
>  
>Barons are members of the aristocracy — wealthy people born into power and influence. How high a baron ranks depends on the country, but the title always carries respect. Similarly, a business leader who is rich, powerful, and influential is a baron. The term is used in phrases such as oil baron and baron of industry. You can also call that kind of baron a big businessman, magnate, mogul, top executive, or tycoon.

When the Bible refers to horns on the Beast, it's always a person of power. The little horn speaks boastfully, is not like the others, he's more menacing, goes to war with the world and is the last king of the last kingdom from the book of Daniel.  That children's book calls the protagonist the little Baron Trump. Or ""the little horn Trump"".

The Bible even explains why so many people are completely delusional in their support for Trump, especially Christians.

>**Matthew 24**  
>  
>**23** At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. **24** For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.**25** See, I have told you ahead of time.

Any Christian saying Trump is sent from God hasn't read their Bible. And for this reason, since they refused to love the truth, God sends them a powerful delusion.

>**2 Thessalonians 2**  
>  
>**The Man of Lawlessness**  
>  
>**2** Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, **2** not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. **3** Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+2&version=NIV#fen-NIV-29665a)\] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. **4** He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.  
>  
>**5** Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? **6** And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. **7** For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. **8** And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. **9** The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,**10** and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.**11** For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie **12** and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.

Just want to reiterate this specific verse to make the point.

>**They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.**

Now, where is all of this going? The Bible says he will try to make us all take a mark so that we cannot buy or sell with out it. It will be a number of a man. Well each of us has our own number assigned to us at birth, our Social Security Number. With the recent Equifax hack, Trump's White House has concluded that SSN is out of date and we need to figure out new technology. The prevailing idea so far has been using blockchain, the same tech used for Bitcoin.

[http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/blockchain-technology-social-security-number-cybersecurity-identity-theft/](http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/blockchain-technology-social-security-number-cybersecurity-identity-theft/)

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/want-to-ditch-social-security-numbers-try-blockchain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/want-to-ditch-social-security-numbers-try-blockchain)

[http://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-technology-replace-social-security-numbers/](http://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-technology-replace-social-security-numbers/)

So the problem they are trying to figure out here is where do they store this information on a person? A card can be easily lost or stolen and a phone can be hacked. Well take a look at what this Israeli company has been doing.

This article is from 2014

This article is from last month.

Their official website

[https://www.dnatix.com/](https://www.dnatix.com/)

>DNAtix has completed the first Proof Of Concept (POC) test by transferring the complete genome sequence of a virus over the Ethereum Blockchain. This test is a key milestone and the company believes that it is the first time that anyone has successfully transferred a DNA sequence over a blockchain.

Now, they say they are doing this for the purpose of sharing genetic information anonymously and maybe they are. But all technology that starts out for good purposes will get subverted for evil if it can be. Imagine from the time you are born, you are genetically tied to a governmental financial system for life. It's the enslavement of the entire human population sourced into our very own DNA.

Now how is Trump or anyone going to convince people to do this? Well it's been pretty obvious the economy we're in right now is about to burst in the next few years at the most. The global financial collapse will be the catalyst to it but something else will happen to. Trump's Space Force isn't just some dumb idea he has. Someone is in his ear, just like with Reagan. 25 scientists mysteriously died working on Reagan's ""Star Wars"" program. No, there's a reason to be building this. Well take a look at this video from 2001 where a woman warns us about building space weapons and what would happen.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eix9mMrPPmE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eix9mMrPPmE)

So this is all to bring about the fake alien invasion right? So what happens then and what does this have to do with the mark of the beast? Did you ever wonder what the whole ""Drain the Swamp"" thing was about? It was to psychologically prepare for the NESARA act, which these supposed benevolent aliens will bring about.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA)

>Harvey Francis Barnard, a Louisiana graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one ""moral evil"" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the 2nd edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.  
>  
>After Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and ""interdimensional"" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government.

# The Psychology of Trump's Malignant Naricissism

Trump is a malignant narcissist. He is literally a hollow shell that is fueled by narcissistic supply in pursuit of having his grandiose false self reflected back to him. This is why he watches so much tv. Mostly news about himself. The only way he knows he exists is if he sees an image of himself reflected back to him like a mirror. He has to see the image of how he sees himself, his grandiose false self, reflected back to him or he chastises the mirror and tries to smash it. Since that is the case, manipulating him is very easy. Flattery is one way, especially if you are a dictator because that's who Trump respects. He looks up to them like Father figures. He thinks anyone who isn't dictator-like, is weak and stupid. Which is why he doesn't like Canada and Europe and they have become our enemies now while our former enemies have become our allies. All of the elites, the wealthy, the secret societies, the Deep State, they are just pawns that were used to set up all the laws and the globalization of the world. They are also the recognized enemy of the people aware of the NWO plot and they have used their awareness of them against them. Q has people convinced Trump is the great hero taking down the evil deep state. This is just pro wrestling to bring about the next stage of the plan. Hegelian dialectic manipulation of political events. This has all been set up so Trump can take it over in one fell swoop.

Trump has been groomed for this for decades and he was set up to be against Obama. If you look back at his earlier tweets, he actually praises Obama and then someone gave him the information about Obama not being born in America. He first talked about this at a conservative event that he was asked to speak at. After the event, he talked about how amazing the response of the crowd was. The narcissistic supply he got from that, he got addicted to and being the leader of the birthers became his new thing. This set him up to be against Obama and allowed the people who have a pathological hate for Obama (future delusional Trump supporters) to psychologically attach themselves to him long before he ever ran for President. Then they put a pseudo fake Reagan costume on him that checked off every single box of beliefs that a certain type of conservative has (mostly the Fox News watching type). They made him seem like an outsider even though he's been friends with the Clintons for decades, to even further psychologically attach conservatives to him.

Trump is just a slave to his grandiose false self and he has to obtain narcissistic supply to fuel it. If you know how to manipulate that, you can get him to do whatever you want. His supporters are literally what is fueling him. If they stop cheering him and coming to his events, he would literally change all of his beliefs in order to get that back. Why do you think he constantly talks about the size of his crowds and his ratings? Without that reaction, he has no idea who he is, he doesn't even exist.

Trump will undoubtedly incite all of his supporters to violence once his Presidency is legitimately threatened from the Mueller investigation or he might do it if the midterms don't go his way. He'll claim election rigging or something. Conversely, we might see the liberals be the ones who initiate the violence instead due to the media whipping everyone up in a frenzy of outrage which will only boil over and explode at some point. Either way, major conflict in the streets due to the citizens themselves taking action is coming. What happens next will largely depend on how much the military and police support him but with all the immigrants they are keeping in camps, they are doing that on purpose so there is maximum chaos when the shit hits the fan. An extra 100,000 or so non-white people so the racial aspect ramps up the violence. Cue our power grid and internet being cut off and martial law will be implemented for sure. Whoever emerges the leader after the dust has settled from all of this, they will have complete control of America and it will be willingly given to them by the citizens who are left. If it isn't Trump, I'm guessing people will be clamoring for Obama to take a 3rd term. I think Obama and Trump might be 2 sides of the same coin and Obama is being set up as the hero to take down Trump. He is either their backup plan, or he was the plan all along.

At that point, everything associated with Trump will be demonized. Conservatism and the Republican party might as well be dead, Christianity will probably be hated because of all the nut bags that believed Trump was from God. Everyone will willingly give up their guns because the 2nd amendment was the only reason the Trump supporters were able to cause that much chaos to begin with. Plus, the tide was already shifting due to using the kids from the Parkland shooting as anti-gun spokespeople. Trump and his supporters were really the last road block to instigating a far left agenda. Trump might just be a way to get them all to show their faces and then lead them to their deaths. With them out of the way, there's nothing left to stop the leftists and the implementation of socialism. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the ""hack"" of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse.

But if Trump remains in power,  the common Christian belief is that the Antichrist makes a 7 year peace deal with Israel and the rest of the Middle East and in the middle of it, he breaks it and sets himself up in the new temple built in Jerusalem due to Israel becoming a nation again and says he is God. Which was an idea well before Trump ever moved the embassy there and Israel put his image on coins and named places there after him. But in Christianity, the temple is the human body. So Trump doesn't necessarily have to be in some Jewish temple when he calls himself God for this prophecy to come true. Now maybe you think that it would be ridiculous to think Trump would ever call himself God but consider this. Christians all over the country think he was sent from God and a man named Mark Taylor claims that God told him about Trump's presidency in 2011. He speaks at length about it and what he is saying is absolutely terrifying unless you think its the work of a good and righteous God. But the way he is describing Trump's future is EXACTLY like the Bible describes the Antichrist. Succeeding in everything he does, going to war with the world, nothing will harm him. So ok, this is just one possible nutjob. Can't be that big of a deal right? Well now you also have Qanon saying Trump is leading the fight between Biblical good and evil and leading all of these blind followers with a carrot on a stick, while brainwashing the shit out of them, just long enough until the shit hits the fan and they need these people to fight for them.

But back to Mark Taylor and how this will tie into Trump calling himself God. Mark is making a movie called The Trump Prophecy which strongly hints that Trump is sent by God. A movie that will undoubtedly get a lot of buzz when it comes out just because of the sheer craziness of it. Now, tell me if you think this is a movie Trump might be interested in seeing and then tell me whether or not Trump is the type of guy who would let the belief of millions of people that he could be a holy savior go to his head and where that road leads. Think David Koresh or Jim Jones with the largest army ever known to humankind at their backs.

Trump has been talking about this peace deal in the Middle East for decades. Called it his Ultimate Deal.

>William Coupon, portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Manhattan,inc. in 1983: “I shot Donald Trump twice. This is my favorite. Trump was offering his services as a ‘peace negotiator’ between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We thought: get the bird, which proceeded to leave droppings behind. Trump was amenable enough, but not at all happy. But ultimately, it was that something in his eyes. His eyes. Not the bird’s.”

Next, there is some connections to Acts and Revelations in the Bible regarding this passage.

>**Acts 2:20**  
>  
>The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.  
>  
>**Revelations 6:12**  
>  
>And when I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red.

Trump was born on June 14th 1946. There was a total lunar eclipse (blood moon) that day and apparently, around the exact same time of his birth, 10:54am over Israel.

[https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/1946-june-14](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/1946-june-14)

[http://wwwcdn.printmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Trump-Birth-Certificate-original1.jpg](http://wwwcdn.printmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Trump-Birth-Certificate-original1.jpg)

Then, there was a tetrad, a series of 4 consecutive total lunar eclipses, with a total solar eclipse in the middle of them, which is extremely rare. One on April 15 2014, October 8th 2014, then the solar eclipse on March 20th 2015, followed by 2 more total lunar eclipses on April 4th 2015 and September 28th 2015. Trump announced his candidacy for President on June 16th 2015. Then there was the total solar eclipse that went over the entire United States in rare fashion on August 21st 2017. Then a super blue blood moon happened on January 31st 2018, the night of Trump's first State of the Union speech. All of these rare events happening around Trump seem too coincidental to not be taken as something more in my opinion.

Some very little known knowledge about what lead up to the famous Manson killings. A group of San Francisco occultists exposed him to killing for ritual sake and a couple years later some rich people tried to hire him to perform a ritual murder that ended up backfiring in their faces.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna preface this all by saying that a lot of what I'm gonna talk about originally came from my own research into various aspects of this stuff. A few years after I went through my ""Charlie"" phase I happened to coincidentally get to know a person that was directly involved with a lot of this stuff. Most of what I am saying comes from someone that was there. I will not say who this person is (it's highly unlikely anyone would know of him anyway), but I have definitely seen enough proof from photos and documents to know this person is definitely telling the truth about his involvement in these circles. He was approached by documentary filmmakers a few years ago who wanted to pay him for these photos and documents (seen proof of that too) and he wouldn't give the stuff to them, so I'm not going to betray his trust. He also just passed away earlier this year, so it would be just rude to go against his wishes. Enough digging could probably identify him if you put in the legwork though.

Much of what Manson did was straight out of the ""how to be a cult leader"" playbook. But, I would suggest that he didn't break any of ""his people"" down. 

He didn't destroy people's beliefs and replace them with his own. I think what's closer to the reality is that he spoke of things that they already believed. He was undoubtedly highly charismatic and he simply said and did things that people vibed with.

As he puts it himself: he was a music man, rode a motorcycle and did whatever he wanted, without the constraints of society. That appealed to and inspired a lot of people. That's just one of the reasons he attracted so many famous and ""known"" people. His music group The Family Jams (where the MSM ideas of ""The Family"" comes from) was very popular in L.A. at the time. They were wanted at all the parties. Not just for the music they brought, but also the fun.

He was also a very small guy, yet commanded a great deal of respect and projected confidence and power everywhere he went..... People are inspired by the underdogs taking powerful positions.

Manson also ALWAYS spoke in riddles. This had the effect of literally mesmerizing people. Just like with Qanon, if you speak in riddles people can hear what they want to hear.

As far as the CIA connection goes, there is one, but it's indirect and the truth of it speaks more to the other things that were going on at the time that influenced Manson and not the other way around. 

When Manson got out of prison in '67 he made his way to San Francisco. While in San Francisco he met Patricia Krenwinkel and Susan Atkins. Both of those girls, but especially Susan AKA Sadie were very involved in the San Francisco/ California underworld.

Right around the same time Al Hubbard AKA Captain Trips was running an operation in San Francisco for the CIA. In this operation he was tasked with finding prostitutes who would take johns to certain locations and unwittingly dose the johns with LSD. This was part of the LSD/MK ULTRA experiments. Sadie was one of the prostitutes that were recruited for this work. She got a kick out of it. And also got an almost unlimited supply of LSD for it.

It's important to realize that at this time with the CIA experiments into LSD that a lot of the players had legit street cred in the underworld. Al Hubbard was highly respected and was actually one of the godfathers of LSD. He was genuinely interested in LSD for his own personal interest and is known as the Johnny Appleseed of LSD. He was literally the first source of LSD for most people in the country. The CIA knew this about him and recruited him for the San Francisco op based on this. He obliged as he had some close friends in the agency. His involvement with LSD and the underworld precluded his involvement with the agency....maybe

So, Sadie was one of his prostitutes and Al Hubbard also happened to be one of the best known figures in the underworld around the nation. That's pretty much the extent of any actual somewhat direct connection to the agency and Manson.

But wait, there's more!

Sadie was quite close to the legit occult community in San Francisco. I'm not talking about Anton Lavey, he was considered a poser. I'm talking about the Kenneth Anger crowd. Kenneth Anger was one of the most well-known and respected American occultists at the time and that group did not fuck around when it came to just about anything. This is the connection my source has. He was in that circle and happened to live caddy corner to the Kenneth Anger house at Alamo Square. Angers house was the old Russian Consulate building. Both Sadie and Bobby Beausoleil were very close to Anger. Sadie appeared in his film Lucifer Rising and Beausoleil did the music for it. Beausoleil was also Angers lover for a minute.

Now, a lot of people want to make the connection to Manson and the Process Church of the Final Judgment saying that the Process Church is what got him into the violent stuff. But, when the first people from The Process came to San Francisco in mid '67 they got hooked up with the crowd at Alamo Square (the park that Angers house was adjacent to) and that's where *they* learned the violent stuff. It fit in perfectly with the experiences they just had while in Mexico where they faced terrible conditions trying to set up a community there. They went't through a lot of pain and struggle in Mexico mainly associated with a hurricane that hit.

ok ok, I could and maybe should write a book about this, but I'll spare you for now.

Basically, there was a lot of violence at that time in San Francisco. There was a motorcycle club called the Straight Satan's that ran the weed and lsd being sold at Alamo Square. They were hippies though and were part of the ""cool"" underworld. Alamo Square and the country in general starting seeing an influx of heroin. They, along with the locals that lived at the square were opposed to this and they banded together with the locals (this included Angers crowd) to stop the sale of heroin in the area. It started as fist fights with heroin dealers, turned into locals keeping 24/7 watch on the park and eventually, a couple of murders happened.

The violence was exclusively between dealers and the Straight Satan's until one of the local hippies ended up stabbing a heroin dealer to death. This guy was kind of part of Kenneth Angers circle. And this is where it took off.

The Kenneth Anger crowd were known for pushing the boundaries of occult practices and rituals. By this time they had begun experimenting with blood letting. The act of drawing blood in magical workings. Up until this point they had only been using their own blood or at least the blood of people willing to take part. After the hippie guy committed the murder he came and told everyone about the rush he got from it, the transcendental experience it triggered in him. This got them all curious and it was all down hill from there.

Now, I am certainly not saying that Kenneth Anger took part in any of this, but some of his friends did.

Like I said before: this is right around the time that the early group of people from The Process came into town and they were there when all this was going down. This is where they got their inspiration for violence. If you know about David Berkowitz and all that stuff, you know what I'm talking about. The stories of The Process sacrificing Alsatian dogs at this time were the beginnings of their experimentation with this.

Really long story made sort of short: This led to The Process and other people in that circle becoming known as blood letters and eventually the blood-letting became almost a party trick. This eventually led to rich party goers wanting in on the action and they began to hire *certain people* to perform this act for them. Sometimes at ""events"". Kill someone as part of your ritual and you add a ton of power to said ritual. This is the Roman Polanski connection.

Polanski wanted that performed at a party and tried to hire Manson for it. Manson was not on board with all that shit, was pissed off because he felt betrayed by the Hollywood types and what happened happened. *""You want me to kill for your entertainment? Well, here. How's this?""*

Nobody asked you to do it and nobody will pay you to do it, yet you do it anyway because you know it is the right thing to do under the circumstances and nobody will thank you for it. You will instead be ridiculed, laughed at and disbelieved by useful idiots, paid idiots and even your own friends and family. 

The genpop doesn't even want to know about factory farms, pesticides, insecticides and heavy metals in their food, air and water; things that personally and directly affect them and their loved ones. Much less will they want to learn about the saturnalist degenerates that run the joint.

Still, you carry on, and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

 I read the thread about approaching conspiracy subjects IRL earlier today and it prompted me to make this thread because I was thinking about this particular subject all week. After PG broke back in 2016, I thought that the way forward was to start discussing what we learned in here, out there. I still believe that, but now realize it is not enough. Most of you have probably heard someone ask you ""even if things are how you say they are, what can you do about it?""

Speaking to others is only half of the way forward. Most of the sick shit that's going on right now is used to establish two concepts, neoliberalism and globalization. By definition, neoliberalism is the ability of vested interests to create monopolies by bullying or buying out the competition and through regulatory capture and blackmail. 

Well, here's what you can do about it - decentralize everything. The way to combat a monolithic establishment is by antagonizing the various aspects of it separately, and not head on.

Learn about decentralized finance, trustless networks and oracles, decentralized and distributed manufacturing. Invest a few bucks in crypto and let it ride for a couple years, can't be worse than keeping it in the bank with a negative interest. Do a lot of research and don't put your money in ponzies for a quick buck. Check out aquaponics and aeroponics and understand the benefits of small scale, high efficiency and localized food production. Stop using proprietary operating systems and software. If you know anything about cars, start a local business that converts gas guzzlers to EVs. Find a job in PV installation company or start your own.

Here are some bonus ramblings in case the wall of text up until now wasn't long enough:

We all have hits or misses. While we benefit others with our successes, our mistakes benefit us personally if we choose to learn from them instead of being [demoralized](https://i.imgur.com/ENQR65w.jpg) by them. Actually, forbid yourself to be demoralized in general. If you're here, you are at least doing something right

Do not be complacent and do not let yourself be placated. There will be more Epsteins, more vile Saviles, more Dominc Strauss-Kahns, and they will all be ""coincidences"". Many of them will even walk free. The news aren't going to take down the neoliberal deep state, qanon isn't going to take down the neoliberal deep state and the normies aren't going to suddenly look up from their handheld brainwashing devices to start marching for justice.

210,The Qanon Twitter ban is a win for conspiracy theorists of all types,44.0,hw0ozd,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hw0ozd/the_qanon_twitter_ban_is_a_win_for_conspiracy/,15.0,1595447333.0,"Twitter is a battlefield which is being fought over in an intense war. This war is a war for power over conversation and narrative. Twitter as a platform strives to be a platform that is used by the majority of people to communicate about topics of all types. The more people using twitter, the more power twitter has over conversation and narrative. 

Conspiracy theorists are a group of people that are many and varied. There are very few characteristics that unite all conspiracy theories and theorists. However, I would argue that all conspiracy theorists benefit from decentralization of conversation platforms. If we all use one platform we are all forced to conform to limits of that platform and we are exposed to greater chance of being censored because we are all gathered in one spot and easily targeted.

Part of Twitter's power comes from the shear volume of people using it. It is a popular platform, in part, because of the relative freedom of speech and access that regular people have to make comments to elites. The Qanon community, whatever you think of them, took advantage of twitter in a more effective way than any other group of conspiracy theorists in twitter's history. They demonstrated methods for exploiting twitter and put so much effort into it that Twitter was forced to ban many of them and restrict free speech. It will be very hard for twitter to get this one back. They have strongly censored speech. They are no longer a platform of free speech. This is a victory for conspiracy theorists in general because twitter lost one of their key selling points and they will lose some of their control of the conversation as a result. 

Decentralization of conversation and narrative is accelerating.",conspiracy,QAnon
211,How is QAnon going to fizzle out?,42.0,8vumha,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vumha/how_is_qanon_going_to_fizzle_out/,152.0,1530642765.0,"It's clear by now that QAnon is a prosperity scam, making grandiose claims of incredible things about to happen, that never actually happen.

Look at all of the ""MOAB"" events Q has forecast as bringing down the cabal that have fizzled out: the sealed indictments, the Nunes memo, the IG report, the Awan scandal. Each has come and gone with nothing happening other than right wing conspiracy predictions failing.

Yet the Q cult persists, fed by a steady diet of rhetorical nonsense from Q and delusional dreams of Hillary Clinton and John McCain being shipped off to Gitmo after a field tribunal.

Prosperity scams usually end either with the scammers being arrested, or people drifting away when they realize that what they've been dreaming of is never going to happen.

So when will the Q cult finally walk away from the never ending can-on-a-string that is QAnon? What will be the final disappointment? ",conspiracy,QAnon

She has openly voiced support for many conspiracy theories like QAnon, PizzaGate, and even called the Parkland School Shooting at ""False Flag"" shooting. She has recently made headlines today by filing articles of impeachment against Joe Biden. Basically Hunter Biden and Ukraine was her justification. 

Anyway this shocked me considering that Joe Biden hadn't even been president for 48 hours. She has been condemned by many high ranking republicans in the past. That leaves the question, what, if anything will come from this more specifically 

1. Why do you think she decided to this? Why so early?
2. What impact will this have on Marjorie Taylor Greene as a representative, Could she be censured for this? Will this hurt her reputation among Republicans?
3. What impact will her actions have on Republican Party going forward? Especially as they attempt to rebuild after their 2020 losses.",PoliticalDiscussion,QAnon

Last week, Brookings, Cato, and Manhattan all reported that nationwide GOP registration has consistently dropped since 2016, with a noted spike in requests for changes coming after the Jan 6 riots.

Theoretically, if these ""moderates"" leave the GOP, that leaves more far-right voters in the party to nominate and support extreme candidates. Staying would at least force other voices to be considered, even if they don't win, or it could give rise to a new positioning in that party, which could shift away from the fringe/extremist elements of their platform.

3,"Midterm anomaly: Despite the general trend, self-described Independents and Moderates still voted in favor of the GOP. This marks another increase since 2010. Why?",65.0,yrwoi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/yrwoi6/midterm_anomaly_despite_the_general_trend/,121.0,1668127226.0,"[Edison Research](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/exit-polls-2022-midterm-2018-shift/) reported that both Independents and Moderates went in favor of the Republican Party despite the opposite [trend.](https://trend.It) It seems this has been the same direction since the 2010 midterms, and that the overall number of self-reported undecideds [increased](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/) by 73% since the turn of the century. Logically, these voters should be consistently following the overall trend given they encompass aspects of both sides.

What kind of explanations are there? A few observations:

**The Florida Effect:** Middle Ground voters went for DeSantis at over [60%](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/09/ron-desantis-better-among-florida-hispanics-than-donald-trump/8316662001/) of that share, which in itself is a record. We could speculate that Florida had a insular effect that set it apart from the rest of the nation, and that the presence of these Floridian moderates made some influence to the overall numbers?

**The Midterm Pendulum Effect:** We have the age-old rule that the party most likely to gain from the Midterm elections would be the one in opposition to the current President.

**MAGA Independence:** At minimum [15%](https://theconversation.com/how-a-divided-america-including-the-15-who-are-maga-republicans-splits-on-qanon-racism-and-armed-patrols-at-polling-places-193378) of Republican voters would consider themselves MAGA supporters first and foremost. We've seen the rising split within the GOP party when it comes to matters concerning January 6th and the election process. Trump himself has made no secret that he's a willing participant towards bucking the GOP trend, and he's grown a loyal group of supporters behind him. There's also been talk of certain MAGA voters dissolution with the GOP's direction and lack of support for the former President.

**The statistics are misinterpreted?** This may be the case on my part.

There seems to be a [correlation](https://theconversation.com/how-a-divided-america-including-the-15-who-are-maga-republicans-splits-on-qanon-racism-and-armed-patrols-at-polling-places-193378) of some sort between the rise of MAGA and that of Independence, and it indicates this may be a major influence. That begs to question, should we now broadly redefine what it means to be an independent voter considering the importance of this group in influence elections? Or is it just fair to say the Democrat party has split from their original appeal?

Also, I've noticed myself in political debate circles that more and more people sympathetic to Republican or Conservative causes tend to label themselves 'both sides'. We can look at evidently conservative commentators like Tim Pool declaring their swing vote history, but seemly catering to a solely right-side narrative.

4,What will happen to the far right after Trump is out of office?,27.0,kwi6t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/kwi6t7/what_will_happen_to_the_far_right_after_trump_is/,74.0,1610550331.0,"The far right has become more active and more mainstream under Trump. Hate, against many minority groups (BIPOC, LGBTQ, religious minorities) has become normalized and more common as the far right has entered the public sphere more and more. In addition, the formerly-niche QAnon conspiracy theory has become mainstream and encouraged even more right-wingers to become public about their beliefs. 

The Capitol riots were planned and executed by members of the far right. They attacked and breached the US Capitol for the first time since the War of 1812 in an unprecedented act of insurrection because of Trump (and to a lesser extent his allies such as Giuliani).

Slowly, the far right’s access to platforms is disappearing. Parler is being removed from stores and Amazon revoked their web server. Trump has been removed from several social media sites. 

Trump will soon be removed from office. He won’t have the position of power that appealed to so many. So what will happen to the far right?

Questions:
What will happen to the far right in future elections? They’ve denounced traditional conservatives (Romney) as “RINOS” so will the far right form their own party and primary candidates?

Will they become more openly violent and hateful? Or will they slowly dissipate as Trump loses public access and power?

Will far right candidates running against traditional conservatives win elections? Or will the GOP civil war only help the democrats?",PoliticalDiscussion,QAnon

This is not the first time Trump has posted QAnon material.  In just the last few weeks we've seen him move drastically closer to the movement, even playing the music at his rally and a move from his political advisors to stop crowds attempting the Q salute.  How could this be possible?  Is it possible Trump was never briefed on QAnon as president? Given his tendencies to watch nightly news pertaining to himself, why would he not go looking for the original posts if he even had the slightest idea of what QAnon was?  Do you think Trump is genuinely clueless about QAnon or is he actively and purposefully amplifying Q?",PoliticalDiscussion,QAnon

With over 60% of the expected vote in and nearly 8 million votes counted, the No vote (which would retain the Governor) maintains a 67-33 edge and a raw vote lead of nearly 2.8 million. While the remaining vote is expected to be more Republican and, thus, the margin will shrink throughout the night and in the coming days, the remaining vote is unlikely to impact the outcome of the recall.

Had the recall succeeded, Question 2, on who Governor Newsom’s successor would have been, currently shows Republican radio talk show host Larry Elder with 43% of the vote, leading his nearest rival, Democratic YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, who trails with 11% of the vote.

*Based on remarks at the RSIS book launch of Alan Chong and Quang Minh Pham (eds),* [*Critical Reflections on China’s Belt and Road Initiative*](https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Reflections-Chinas-Belt-Initiative-ebook/dp/B0846GM9Q3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Critical+Reflections+on+China%E2%80%99s+Belt+and+Road+Initiative&qid=1601348589&sr=8-1)*, Palgrave MacMillan, 2020*

Political scientists Alan Chong and Quang Min Pham bring with their edited volume originality as well as dimensions and perspectives to the discussion about the Belt and Road that are highly relevant but often either unrecognized or underemphasized.

The book is about much more than the material aspects of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In fact, various chapter authors use the Belt and Road to look at perhaps the most fundamental issue of our times: how does one build a global world order and societies that are inclusive, cohesive and capable of managing interests of all stakeholders as well as political, cultural, ethnic and religious differences in ways that all are recognized without prejudice and/or discrimination?

In doing so, the book introduces a moral category into policy and policy analysis. That is an important and commendable effort even if it may be a hard sell in an increasingly polarized world in which prejudice and bias and policies that flow from it have gained new legitimacy and become mainstream in various parts of the world.

It allows for the introduction of considerations that are fundamental to managing multiple current crises that have been accentuated by the pandemic and its economic fallout.

One of those is put forward in the chapter of the late international affairs scholar Lily Ling in which she writes about the need for a global agenda to take the requirements of ordinary people into account to ensure a more inclusive world. The question is how does one achieve that.

It is a question that permeates multiple aspects of our individual and collective lives.

If the last decade was one of defiance and dissent, of a breakdown in confidence in political leadership and systems and of greater authoritarianism and autocracy to retain power, this new decade, given the pandemic and economic crisis, is likely to be a continuation of the last one on steroids.

One only has to look at continued Arab popular revolts, Black Lives Matter, the anti-lockdown protests, and the popularity of conspiracy theories like QAnon. All of this is compounded by decreasing trust in US leadership and the efficacy of Western concepts of governance, democratic backsliding, and the handling of the pandemic in America and Europe.

Mr. Chong conceptualizes in his chapter perceived tolerance along ancient silk roads as stemming from what he terms ‘mercantile harmony’ among peoples and elites rather than states. It was rooted, in Mr. Chong’s mind, in empathy, a sense of spirituality and a mercantile approach towards the exchange of ideas and goods.

It was also informed by the solidarity of travellers shaped by the fact that they encountered similar obstacles and threats on their journeys. And it stems from the connectivity needs of empires that built cities and roads to retain their control that Mr. Chong projects as civilization builders.

There may be an element of idealization of the degree of tolerance along the ancient Silk Road and the assertion that the new silk road is everything that the old silk road was not. But the notion of the role of non-state, civil society actors is key to the overall quest for inclusiveness.

So is the fact that historic travellers like Fa-Hsien, Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta grappled with the very same issues that today’s world is attempting to tackle: the parameters of human interaction, virtue, diversity, governance, materialism, and the role of religion.

The emphasis on a moral category and the comparison of the ancient and the new Silk Road frames a key theme in the book: the issue of the China-centric, top down nature of the Belt and Road. Vietnamese China scholar Trinh Van Dinh positions the Belt and Road as the latest iteration of China’s history of the pioneering of connectivity as the reflection of a regime that is at the peak of its power.

Mr. Van Dinh sees the Belt and Road as the vehicle that will potentially revitalize Chinese economic development. It is a proposition on which the jury is still out in a world that could split into two distinct camps.

It is a world in which China brings much to the table but that is also populated by black and grey swans, some of which are of China’s own making. These include the favouring of Chinese companies and labour in Belt and Road projects, although to be fair Western development aid often operated on the same principle. But it also includes China’s brutal response to perceived threats posed by ethnic and religious minorities.

That may be one arena where the failure to fully consider the global breakdown in confidence in leadership and systems comes to haunt China. That is potentially no more the case than in the greater Middle East that stretches from the Atlantic coast of Africa into the Chinese province of Xinjiang.

Its not an aspect that figures explicitly in political scientist Manouchehr Dorraj’s contribution to the book on China’s relationship with Iran as well as Saudi Arabia but lingers in the background of his perceptive analysis of anticipated changes in the region’s lay of the land.

Mr. Dooraj focusses on three aspects that are important as one watches developments unfold: The impact of shifts in the energy mix away from oil coupled with the emergence of significant reserves beyond the Middle East, Iran’s geopolitical advantages compared to Saudi Arabia when it comes to the architecture of the Belt and Road, and the fact that China is recognizing that refraining from political engagement is no longer viable.

However, China’s emphasis on state-to-state relationships could prove to be a risky strategy assuming that the Middle East will retain its prominence in protests that seek to ensure better governance and more inclusive social and economic policies.

That takes on added significance given that potential energy shifts could reduce Chinese dependence on Middle Eastern energy as well as repeated assertions by Chinese intellectuals that call into question the relative importance of China’s economic engagement in the region as well as its ranking in Chinese strategic thinking.

The implications of the book’s partial emphasis on what Mr. Chong terms philosophical and cultural dialogue reach far beyond the book’s confines. They go to issues that many of us are grappling with but have no good answers.

In his conclusion, Mr. Chong suggests that in order to manage different value systems and interests one has to water down the Westphalian dogma of treating national interests as zero-sum conceptions.

One just has to look at the pandemic the world is trying to come to grips with, the need for a global health care governance that can confront future pandemics, and the world’s environmental crisis to realize the relevance of former Singaporean diplomat and public intellectual Kishore Mahbubani’s description of the nation state system as a boat with 193 cabins and cabin administrators but no captain at the helm.

Mr. Chong looks for answers in the experience of ancient Silk Road travellers. That may be a standard that a Belt and Road managed by an autocratic Chinese leadership that is anything but inclusive would at best struggle to meet.
