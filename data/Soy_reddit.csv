0,Do you people even understand why eating bugs is bad?,1579.0,vhi42y,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vhi42y/do_you_people_even_understand_why_eating_bugs_is/,766.0,1655831121.0,"If you're going to be a ""conspiracy theorist"" you need to actually have theories and understands of why ""things r bad m'kay""

So let me ask you. Why do you think eating bugs is unhealthy? Because it's gross? Because it's dehumanizing? Well, that's not good enough to the average normie plebbit user going about his day. They'll say stuff like ""well they eat bugs in south east asia!"" etc etc.

What would you reply with? I guarantee that you don't know how to respond to that.

This is the reason that eating bugs is dehumanizing and poor for your health:

Saying that certain cultures ""eat bugs"" is shaded with racism. Many of the asia countries who ate bugs have historically struggled to feed their populations so they had to resort to eating cheap carbohydrates like rice, and INSECTS for protein. This is not an ""ideal"" diet by any means and it's not like they enjoyed eating this. This did it because they had to in order to survive. Sure some people still eat them now for cultural reasons, but the original purpose of eating insects was to avoid starving to death.

Insects contain protein, but so do many things like wheat and soy. Why is protein from soy any different than protein from beef? Do you know? Will you know how to respond when some plebbitor questions you?

There is something called a DIAAS score for protein, which stands for digestible indispensable amino acid score, which basically tells you how a protein source ranks in terms of how complete it's essential amino acid profile is, and how well you can absorb them.

For example, beef, pork, and eggs are all complete profiles and rank around 1.15, whereas wheat flour and almonds are not complete profiles and rank around 0.40.

This is why eating 100 grams of wheat flour protein and 100 grams of beef ARE NOT THE SAME in terms of nutrition. You MUST explain this to people in order to get them to understand. Stop with all the ""omg did you even know bill gates bought farm land for crickets?"" they will not understand.

The shell of insects is indigestible to humans, though some animals can process it. Yes, many animals can eat bugs or only eat bugs to survive, because they have EVOLVED the processes necessary to extract the maximum nutrition out of insects. We have not, you must also explain this to people. Insects score a very low DIAAS number which is why eating insects is UNHEALTHY and should only be used to prevent starvation.

Please stop with the whole ""OMG BILL GETS AND WEF ARE LE BAD"" Yes they are bad but you need to explain why things are bad or people are just going to think you're a dumbass.",conspiracy,Soy

5,We have a pandemic of the vaccinated,501.0,pdgm43,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pdgm43/we_have_a_pandemic_of_the_vaccinated/,228.0,1630180285.0,"I dont really give AF what people think of my/a reddit account anymore.

But I can't deal with the super spreading vaccinated blaming non vaccinated people for spreading the virus.

I have been involved in 3 of the following scenarios where an unvaccinated person is being punished for the fault of the vaccinated. Not completely their fault as they were told just get vaccinated and you'll have freedoms again. 

However the vaccinated exhibit no symptoms. They do not social distance, do not wear masks and do not even know they are sick. They then unknowingly spread the virus to people everyday and the unvaccinated are blamed for the rise in cases. 

This is not difficult. The vaccine does nothing, NOTHING to stop the spread. In fact common sense shows that a vaccinated person who is living thier best life contributes to a much higher transmission rate than others. If we feel ill most people will stay home, get tested and isolate. Then we also take solace that we now have antibodies.

Most people are not disrespectful in nature. Even though I believe covid to be a joke in regards to the survival rate, if I tested positive I would isolate and quarantine out of respect for others. There are some people at a very high risk and they deserve to be protected.

Whether or not the symptoms with natural antibodies are as absent as those with the vaccine is yet to be revealed since we cannot get information on natural antibodies.

Everyone live their life and enjoy your 99.9 survivability rate. If you are obese, diabetic or have a comorbidity, then please seek the advice of a physician you trust, get another opinion and make your choice. 

Be safe. God bless America and thank you to all the men and women who sacrificed themselves to give me the right to choose.

Edit- My wife, a state employee has been sent home twice and forced to stay home WITHOUT pay because a infected vaccinated person came into the office. The vaccine acted person was rewarded with work from home benefits for 2 weeks. My wife was told she takes her sick time or gets nothing. HER SICK TIME and she's not the one sick. Let this sink in. This is a state gov.

She cannot and will not get the vaccine on our own accord and by the advice of 2 cardiologists. She has a very rare heart condition and the vaccine has shown many cases where it contributes to heart inflammation. She told she's a traitor a piece of shit, a domestic terrorist and im fucking sick of it. Come to my home and talk your shit and I'll show you what terror looks like.

So for anyone who thinks this doesn't happen, it's happened to my family 3 times in 6 months. Where we are suffering because a vaccinated person with no symptoms forced US to lose income. We have been blatantly told that if we were vaccinated we would be able to work....even though we test negative. Yes legal representation is in the works.

Edit - Threatening me and my family? Telling me to die cocksucker? Telling us we don't contribute to society? My tax dollars have paid education for half of you privileged soy drinking 25 yr olds. Like I stated above, come out my way cowards. This was clearly posted for what used to be considered honest debate. I have literally lost all faith ALL FAITH in the youth. You will reap what you sow. Despite what you've been taught history IS real and I've never been more convinced that it will repeat. Keep it coming, my resolve grows stronger with each empty threat. Most people here have never taken one to the jaw. You can always tell.

Edit - TIL half of Americans don't deserve the title

Final edit- To the one who MADE this personal, who attempted to ruin my life, thank you, you communists continue to prove our point. I will defend my freedom at all costs. I have my eye on you as well. Don't fuck up.",conspiracy,Soy
6,Your an idiot if you think Jan 6. Was an insurrection.,432.0,opzo8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/opzo8j/your_an_idiot_if_you_think_jan_6_was_an/,531.0,1627036410.0,"It was riot, libs. You usually love those. Calm down.
This past week marked what Democrat legacy media claimed was the “sixth month anniversary” of the January 6th “insurrection.” Are they toddlers? Do they mark their half birthdays too? An anniversary is something that happens yearly.

But the lib journos are apparently so desperate to distract from inflation, soaring gas prices, and Biden’s mediocre mumblings that they will invent reasons to take the news cycle back to January. Anything is better than letting the public see another Kamala interview on ABC.

Speaking of which, perhaps you’ve seen some of the world’s dumbest pundits (Dowd of ABC, Schmidt of MSNBC) making the rounds on tv in the past few days to claim that January 6th was worse than 9/11? Yes, that happened, twice. If you offered $1000 to a random person on the street to come up with something more viciously moronic to say, your money would be safe.

What’s even more troubling is that this maniacal propaganda is working well with the triple-masked, soy milk drinking beta males who think that MSNBC is news and Fauci is really smart. According to a recent PBS poll, 2 out of 3 Americans think our democracy is “at risk.”

OK, what exactly was the big plan for the “insurrection” anyway? Only unserious people use that term seriously. Using Democrat standards, it was a “mostly peaceful protest” that got out of hand.
The violent overthrow of a government probably would take more than bear spray and fire extinguishers. The most ominous weapon that any of the Jan. 6 organizers seemed to have was Q Anon Shaman’s spear, with flag attached. While his furry hat may be intimidating to people of Jerry Nadler’s stature and courage, nobody really believes that he was going to be able to take on the Capitol Hill Police, dozens of law enforcement agencies, and the National Guard with a stone age weapon and some face paint.

But Q Anon Shaman- real name Jacob Anthony Chansley- has been in prison in solitary confinement for six months because a judge continues to pretend that he really believes there was an imminent ‘threat to our democracy’ on January 6th. This is Stasi-level police state tyranny.

This jaw-dropping and malicious exaggeration of Jan. 6 is weaponized now for the most underhanded purpose. The authoritarian Left is pretending to believe a coup attempt took place in order to justify the ongoing suppression of those they claim could be behind a future coup. To save our village, America, the Left is willing to burn it down.
Speaking of which, whatever you do, don’t ask about the hundreds of riots they cheered on in the name of BLM in 2020. Those were fine, even “public health authorities” during the lockdown approved. Democrats are certain that sometimes you have to loot some innocent bystander businesses to prove your point about systemic police violence and stick it to the “carceral state.”

Just remember: The libs who constantly parade their tears on social media about the imminent “death of our democracy” are the ones smothering its face with a pillow in the hospital while CNN drones on in the background. And they think they’re brave for doing it.",conspiracy,Soy
7,A Giant Magnetic Field Hole Is Splitting In Two - Nothing To See Here So Fuck Off And Die,373.0,gpaobw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gpaobw/a_giant_magnetic_field_hole_is_splitting_in_two/,99.0,1590261081.0,"Earth's magnetic field is weakening 5% per decade.

The South Atlantic Magnetic Field Anomaly (SAMFA) is a mega monster magnetic field hole that stretches from South America all the way to South Africa. The magnetic field in that massive area is so weak that satellites have to powered off for their own safety.

SMAFA is moving west 12 mile per year and is starting to split into two. This is extremely important because solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and humans. Scientists are obviously told to downplay the danger. 20 million people live right under the hole in the city of Sao Paulo.

Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc)  \- YT 6 min - Best part starts at 2:45

Scientists and policymakers don't want you to know that magnetic pole shifts can happen in as little time as a hundred years. It can take up to a thousands years too. When this occurs, the earth can have as many as 5 magnetic poles slowly moving around the planet. Exposure to solar/space radiation is increased under these poles which can take up to a decade to pass overhead. Solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and animals.

I believe that the SAMFA splitting into two is the beginning of the multi-polar phenomena. Policymakers prohibit discussion of it by scientists due to fear, panic, money etc. - the usual suspects. It's why you don't know so many things that are extremely important to your well being.

At the same time that the SAMFA gets weaker, we are also losing mid latitude lower stratospheric ozone, which together with the magnetic field, also protects us from the sun. Again policymakers do not want you to know this, that's why there's been a rash of ""Ozone Hole Healing"" articles in recent months.

This is due to scientific academic fraud. The chemicals that were burning a hole in the ozone have not gone away, they are being smuggled as a matter of routine out of China into the US and Europe. The chemicals that replace them are hardly any better. Air conditioning demand is so big that it will use up all our renewable energy power by 2050.

The reason this is happening is because of construction fraud. China has built more city blocks in 10 years than America ever did in its whole history. They pour more cement in 3 years than America ever did in 300 years. Substandard material construction fraud is rampant because cement requires a special sand that is quickly running out. Desert sand won't do. So what do we do? We lie about what sand we are using, that's why new condos in Australia and Canada will only last 25 years instead of 50, it's also why new condos are falling apart in Australia.

Do you remember when Volkswagen was caught doing emissions fraud? Turns out it wasn't just them. Fraud in the safety of products and processes are prevalent in the market. This means that fraud is rampant in the control of social media.

The control of social media, and the minds of millions of kids, is paramount to our unending desire to get rich destroying earth. Both capitalism and socialism are based on plenty. Everything you think you know is 100 years old.

We have to stop burning 50% of fuel in 10 years. Scientists are not allowed to say that. They are told they must say, we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. They get paid by tax dollars so they do what they're told.  This is probably one of the last places I'm not banned, and even where I am not banned, these ideas are fought against tooth and nail by young people.

By Chris Kanthan

Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth! Millions of families visit the theme park every year to enjoy the magical place of rides, spectacular shows and cheerful cartoon figures. Everything is clean, perfect and joyful. Unless … you realize that Cinderella might actually be homeless. That’s right, 10% of Disneyland’s employees are actually homeless, many more are on food stamps, and 75% struggle to make ends meet.

Does this ring familiar? Think of America. Behind the façade of being the greatest country on Earth with the largest GDP and the wealthiest billionaires, there are tens of millions of Americans who are left behind just like Disney’s employees.

This neo-feudalistic model isn’t isolated to Disney or Walmart, it’s systemic. For example, the bus driver at Apple – which has $280 billion in cash – is forced to sleep in a van because he can’t afford the Silicon Valley rent; Facebook’s cafeteria workers live in a garage; and thousands of American Airlines’ employees are forced to depend on food stamps.

America is being eaten alive by corporate greed; and Disneyland has been taken over by Scrooge.

Let’s look at some Disney Inc. statistics.

Total profit per year: $9 billion

Total employees: 200,000

Notice that the profit reflects what’s left after all the expenses, including the salaries, have been paid. So, in a utopian world, the Disney management will do the math ($9 billion / 200,000 = $45,000) and send a check for $45K to every employee, Mickey included. That kind of profit-sharing would really make Disneyland the happiest place on Earth. Does that happen? No way!

Does Cinderella get a check for perhaps $20K, $10K, $5K or even $1K? Nope, nope, nope, nope. Cinderella gets nada, zero, zilch. She should be content with the $12/hour salary and must smile happily for the kids.

In Disneyland, Cinderella never gets to meet her prince.

Disney’s CEO gets paid $46 million a year, which translates to $23,000 an hour. Imagine Disney’s CEO coming to work on Jan 2nd. He wishes a few people “happy new year,” orders coffee, sits on his desk, makes a few phone calls … and he has already made more money than what Ariel would make during the rest of the year.


Of course, the CEO should get paid more, but does he deserve a salary that’s equivalent to 2,000 Disney employees? If the CEO doesn’t show up for work for a day, Disneyland will continue running. If 2,000 employees take a day off, the park would be shut down.

In the 1960s, the CEO-to-worker salary ratio was 25. Today it’s often 600 or more, sometimes even more than 1000 (for example, at Walmart). Much of the executive compensation comes in the form of stock options and bonuses based on stock performance. In a rational and unrigged world, the CEOs would increase their revenues and profits to get bonuses. Not anymore.


Now, the CEOs simply use a no-brainer solution to boost the stock prices – it’s called stock buybacks or share repurchases. This involves a firm using corporate profits (or even borrowed money) to buy its own stocks. BTW, this used to be illegal until the 1980s.

Since 2007, US corporations have spent trillions of dollars on stock buybacks. In 2018 alone, they will spend$800 billion on this financial engineering tool (which has also led to a massive stock market bubble). They won’t use the billions to hire Americans, boost wages or innovate new products. Instead, the CEOs will buy yachts and tell you that Chinese or Mexicans stole your jobs.


Do the low-wage employees of Disneyland get any shares or stock options? A silly question, indeed.

Thus we have a situation where American employers ruthlessly exploit American workers. This isn’t a good model for a country. China and Mexico don’t make us poor; predatory capitalism does.

Paying good wages to hardworking employees is not socialism or communism. Henry Ford understood this when he more than doubled the wages of his workers in 1914.

However, hundred years later, maximizing profit has become a fundamentalist dogma. You can imagine a conversation among the factory-farming executives:


Guy #1: Why the heck are these chickens roaming out in the farms? We would save so much money if we lock them up in cages.

Guy #2: Brilliant idea! Let’s lock up five chickens in a cage. We will save more. More is always better.

Guy #3: I really don’t understand why we feed them expensive salads and healthy stuff. Let’s feed them cheap GMO corn and GMO soy from my friends at Monsanto.


Guy #4: Experts tell me that if we give them caffeine and anti-depressants, the chickens will stay awake longer, eat more, and get fatter.


Secret $1.8 Million Cryptocurrency Script
Guy #5: And when they get sick, load them up with antibiotics and steroids.


Guy #5: These stupid chickens are also so small. Let’s drug them with some growth hormones. I am getting a lot of pressure from the private equity funds about profits per chicken.

Apart from being inhumane and psychopathic, this system forgets or ignores the fact that we have to eat these chickens. Sick chicken = sick people. Call it Karma or “revenge of the chickens.”

Similarly, poor workers = poor country. And you can imagine a similar conversation among corporate executives regarding workers – “cut their wages and benefits”, “make them work overtime”, “hire part-time employees rather than full-time” and so on.


You can’t grow the economy if American workers don’t get paid enough, especially by profitable multi-billion dollar corporations. 2/3rd of our GDP is based on consumer spending. It’s no wonder that in the last ten years, the US economy cumulatively grew only by a dismal 35%. Compare that to China, which grew by an astounding 200% during that same period.

And it’s not a coincidence that China’s average wages have more than doubled in the same period.

**TLDR of this post is that it seems likely there will be a major market crash between now and November. The question is how to handle finances/investments knowing what we know.**

This isn’t a post to try to explain any of the individual data points below individually…you can do that homework on your own.

This is a post with a bunch of data points intended to solicit thoughts/discussion regarding what they mean collectively and how to proceed going forward in a way that isn’t simply “GTFO of the stock market and/or the United Socialist States of Amerika.”

Data Point 1: After latest stress test bank buybacks return starting 1 July. (Because profits!) Will they want to make those purchases at current market prices?

Data Point 2:  J.P. Morgan and others are shorting precious metals and likely still need to cover their short positions (silver in particular) ahead of Basel 3.

Data Point 3: Basel III goes into effect 1 Jan 22. (Unallocated precious metals only count as 85% the value of allocated reserves when counted against assets etc. etc.) This may significantly disrupt the way in which accounting, trading and shorting of “paper” precious metals takes place.

Data Point 4: The World Economic Forum hosted a certain called Event 201 in October 2019. It was a tabletop discussion on how to deal with a worldwide pandemic. On July 9th, the World Economic Forum will host Cyber Polygon 2021 to discuss dealing with a cyber pandemic with “Covid-like characteristics.” After all, just as with a health pandemic, a cyber pandemic is “just a matter of time,” right?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRLw6trwXco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRLw6trwXco)

Data Point 5: Federal mortgage moratoriums are expiring 30 June. Letting the timing of a 2008 collapse on steroids play out organically would decrease profits. A timed, controlled demolition of the market  would maximize profits for a select few banks. While people may rightly be fixated on the health of residential mortgages, relatively few seem to be considering that commercial real estate busts alone could serve as a trigger event.

Data Point 6: As mentioned already on reddit, DTC-004, ICC-005, OCC-004, OCC-003, ICC-014 appear to allow banks to: short the market as a whole and thereby hedge/profit during a collapse, cannibalize failed banks and absorb their assets, invite third parties to cannibalize failed banks, and finally, to be legally immune to various forms of wrongdoing. All rules above will be in effect by 1 July 2021.

Data Point 7: U.S. Govt “UFO Disclosure” is scheduled for June 25th. Of course nothing of note is expected by believers an unbelievers alike…but it is interesting how closely it coincides with the above data points. Even if we were told that the aliens had informed world governments in writing that they were already among us for purposes of exterminating all life on the planet, most hedge funds would need a week before they even went, “huh, that’s disturbing.”

Data Point 8: The amount of leverage in the financial system is higher than it has ever been.

Data Point 9: P/E ratios are in ridiculous territory given fundamentals in most sectors.

Data Point 10: Blackrock and Dark Pools provide the Fed/US Govt a means of directly influencing the stock market/banking system aside from the beloved and wonderfully equitable quantitative easing route.

Data Point 11: The assimilation of banks and assets on a scale dwarfing 2008 may require a 3-4 day banking holiday to properly expedite.

Data Point 12: There is an epic drought ongoing in the western US. Global food production is falling. Corn and Soy are up 60% this year.

Data Point 13: Actual inflation in the US is approximately 15% if calculated as it was in the early 70s...when inflation hit 16%. The current CPI conveniently ignores food, energy, and reality.

Data Point 14: The FDIC has less than four pennies in its coffers for every dollar it would have to cover for Americans with bank deposit accounts in excess of $250k. In theory the Fed could print the other 96-97 cents after the FDIC goes broke…but will they? Why not cut out the middle man and have a Fed money account?

Data Point 15: A direct Fed account for every American over the age of 18 has already been proposed. Such a paradigm would cut out banks as the middle man and allow the Fed to use stimulus with negative interest rates or rollover rules in order to drive the velocity of money as they see fit. Alzo, it would undoubtedzly make ze Klaus Schwab happy.

Data Point 16: The monetary policies of Federal Reserve are increasing wealth inequality and the “K-shaped recovery” that has marked not just 2020 and 2021, but every year since 1971 when Nixon abandoned the gold standard. (See Cantillon effect)

Data Point 17: Marginal/Effective tax rates will increase with inflation. A person in 2021 making 50k might pay 10k in taxes with a 20% total tax rate. IF (and that’s a big if) their income keeps up with inflation over a few years of high inflation, they are still screwed because by the time they are making 150k, they are in a higher tax bracket paying a 30% tax rate despite no change to their purchasing power before taxes.

Data Point 18: Social Security and a host of pension funds are insolvent without serious inflation.

Data Point 19: The United States debt is going parabolic.

Data Point 20: The United States is insolvent without serious inflation. If you had a money printer, no productive skills and a $1M debt, would you pay it with money under your mattress, or would you use the money printer to print another $1M and live with the inflation you caused?

Data Point 21: Let’s reference point 12. Food is going to be expensive even without inflation. Now a quick quiz. He’s a philanthropist, vaccine financier and tireless vaccine cheerleader. His arrest has been sought by officials in Kenya and Italy for “crimes against humanity.” He was a buddy of Jeff Epstein (RIP?) and he’s a pal of Klaus Schwab’s. **He is also the largest agricultural land owner in the United States.**  His daddy helped make Planned Parenthood what it is today. Who is he?  Bill Gates.

Data Point 22: The real unemployment figure in the U.S. is likely 20%.

Data Point 23: The US dollar currently enjoys exorbitant privilege as the global reserve currency but China and the IMF are making inroads to ending Bretton Woods.

Data Point 24: The housing market crash of 08 took approx. 4 months to materialize on Wall St. Following the same model, commercial real estate would hit by early November of this year but admittedly, there’s more than a few factors that are different this time around.

Data Point 25: Global oil production is plateauing due to Covid and reduction in new drilling investment. This will drive crude prices higher even in the most optimistic scenarios for electric vehicle adoption.

Data Point 26: Electric vehicle mass production will be hampered by increasing oil prices, civil unrest, rare earth trade restrictions and lack of domestic mining capability.

Data Point 27: Media censorship is at an all-time high.

Data Point 28: When a given population needs to spend more than 40% of its income on food, odds for regime change and civil war increase dramatically (Arab spring followed on heels of GFC).

Data Point 29: When leaders are worried about civil war, they are more likely to turn the population toward external threats out of self-preservation.

Data Point 30: You don’t really want to reach 33 data points, do you?

Data Point 31: The US education system has been broken for decades. The teaching of critical race theory (CRT) promotes ingroup/outgroup behaviors which are diametrically opposed to friendship between people of different race. CRT clearly fosters the generalizations and systemic racism in and of itself.

Data Point 32: When people are busy arguing over what the color of each other’s skin should mean about them, governments officials can capitalize on a raucous, uninformed population begging for restrictions to their freedoms.

Data Point 33: A majority of Americans are a decent people despite being an uninformed population begging for and accepting restrictions to their freedoms.

Data Point 34: There is always hope, hopefully.

&#x200B;

**Possible Conclusions:**

1. Big Banks have an incentive to collapse the stock market. They have a means to directly profit while also eliminating competition.
2. A stock market crash may require investors to cover margin and allow brokerages to liquidate shares. Precious metals prices may fall with the market and provide ideal coverage for big bank shorts to both cover their shorts and make additional PM asset purchases en masse.
3. The World Economic Forum has cheered Covid-19 as an opportunity to shape the world as they desire…would they not also cheer if they were able to say “I told you so” and actively shape the world in the wake of a cyber pandemic? Globalists like Schwab and Gates love crisis because it opens opportunity for “positive change and inclusion.”
4. A ransomware attack on a major US bank would introduce the need to halt computer banking transactions. No credit cards at the gas pump for a few days. Many Americans flee the stock market for cash. Stock market tanks, little banks get caught with pants down in the leverage game. Bank holiday declared to coincide with a long weekend. Big banks eat small banks and maybe get a nice little bit of “bail in” legislation from the socialists on capitol hill.  This move also has the added benefit of helping the FDIC stay solvent.
5. Following the recovery of the banking sector, the IMF will impose new rules, likely introduce a crypto SDR or equivalent and banks and countries alike that are sitting on large stores of PM will attempt to let the price of gold/silver run wild to benefit their own balance sheets. The fight over global purchasing power could lead to war.
6. With global food and energy prices soaring and inflation running rampant, most Americans will be unable to make ends meet. Universal Basic Income and wealth redistribution will keep the mob at bay, possibly with helpful “direct-to-u” Fed accounts. Hungry men get mad, but they don’t ask many questions.
7. Those people who do “ask questions,” and do not want to “build back better” will feel the full brunt of their respective domestic surveillance apparatus. They will be mislabeled as “domestic terror threats” or “racists” if they happen to be white and have a problem with wealth redistribution/reparations.
8. Global food scarcity and inflation are already hitting Africa and poorer nations. Any vaccine sterilization program Bill Gates might have succeeded with in Keyna will soon pale in comparison to the starvation-driven die off that is to come for poorer nations when the food bidding wars that are already taking place get serious.

**9. In summary, given all the above, historic timelines for bank insolvency, given greed and potential complications driven by Basel III, a “cyber attack” or just a simple overdue crash which resets the financial landscape between mid-July and early November appears imminent. Coinciding with this will be the rise of the Fed, UBI, inflation, a totalitarianist surveillance police state, loss of dollar reserve currency status and starvation on a scale not seen in our lifetimes. Oh, and war.**

16,"BPA in plastic, destroying the alpha male, forced feminization of a nation, early female puberty, and breast cancer.",181.0,f4fed4,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f4fed4/bpa_in_plastic_destroying_the_alpha_male_forced/,112.0,1581799431.0,"I am not a doctor but I know a lot about hormones. Not a lot of people understand exactly what they do. A little crash course before I get to the meat of this conspiracy.

 Aromatase is the process in the body of converting testosterone to estrogen, testosterone can convert to estrogen but estrogen cannot convert to testosterone. Testosterone is produced in the testicles and adrenal gland  and estrogen is produced in the ovaries and through aromatase so both males and females have different levels of testosterone and estrogen. Foods also contain testosterone and estrogen, oysters are a common aphrodisiac which means to increase libido because they are rich in testosterone and testosterone is responsible for libido. Soy is rich in estrogen for instance and I will get to that, think about how much food is soy based.

Obesity, smoking pot, drinking alcohol, overstimulated libido, and high cardio activity are things that convert testosterone to estrogen. Guys, after binging on porn or prolonged sexual activity do you notice randomly going limp after a while? Estrogen is a vasoconstricter which is the opposite of viagra and constricts the blood vessels to kill erections, that happens when being turned on for too long and the excess testosterone converting to estrogen causing vasoconstriction. Same reason getting drunk makes guys horny then kills erections.

We start the same in utero, The Y chromosome causes a slight imbalance in testosterone and what would be the ovaries in females develops into testicles and the testosterone from those further androgenize the fetus into a male. 

So now that we understand that let us get to the meat of this and how to force feminize a population on men and have girls mature way too early. Ever hear of BPA in plastic? BPA mimics the effects of estrogen and will feminize men, especially little boys before puberty.

Before puberty males and females are very similar. If a prepubescent boy takes in a lot of BPA then he will start female puberty and begin to transition before the testicles drop and produce enough testosterone to start male puberty. Tender breasts, gynecomastia (man boobs), wide hips, a layer of subcutaneous fat, high voice, lack of body hair growth.....these are all traits of female puberty that many male children exhibit.

What happens is too much BPA and a young boy will begin a female transition the same as being transgender but then the testicles drop, male puberty begins, and rips the boy out of female puberty, but things like breast growth, bone frame, and brain development are permanent and the mental effects of detransition and starting male puberty will cause severe depression and dysphoria.

Little boys grow up identifying as women can be from the BPA causing them to transition into female before male puberty and they are use to it. Testicles dropping during female puberty and the testosterone will feel unnatural and cause dysphoria and the boy will naturally want to continue female puberty instead.

In young girls the BPA will put estrogen levels at the level for puberty to begin way earlier than it should and can start puberty years earlier. Too much estrogen will cause breast cancer, after puberty when the ovaries produce normal estrogen levels the BPA will cause an excess and breast cancer can happen.

This destroys ""men"" and causes girls to mature early, get cancer, and die early. I believe this is by design.

Lets take Japan as an example and asians, the culture, and effects of hormones. Japanese people eat a lot of soy and that is rich in estrogen. Traits of estrogen are good skin, high voice, lack of body and facial hair, smaller frames, low libido and low sex drive. Testosterone causes facial hair, body hair, cranial ridge, large chin, strong jawline, wide shoulders, large ribs and frame. As a culture Japanese eat lots of soy/estrogen, the men display many female secondary sexual characteristics as a culture and very few masculine traits associated with testosterone. Coincidence? How many Japanese men do you see with strong chins, a cranial ridge, lots of body hair, a thick beard, and a deep voice? Not many right?

Japanese women are petite, great skin, very little body hair, and very feminine in general. This is just a theory, but to me it appears that ingesting a lot of soy has caused racial traits to be affected by hormones on a racial level. I would think cultures that are naturally larger in frame with more masculine traits is probably because something the culture eats that is rich in testosterone and has a similar but opposite effect and the racial traits come from testosterone in the food.

That is just an example. When I was a freshmen in highschool in the 90's the seniors all had full beards and were very masculine. By the time I was a senior we noticed the freshman were looking really small compared to us, the freshmen girls were developed and we were like wow, girls didn't look like that when we were freshmen! I thought back on that after learning about hormones.

The conspiracy? I think ""men"" are being thinned out and girls are developing early to over sexualize them for the porn industry. We need men, big strong, dominant, alpha males to lead and protect. When it comes time to protect ourselves from the enemy it is going to be a bunch of feminized males and that puts us in a bad spot physically. A nation of feminized men is much easier to control than a bunch of big strong dominant alpha males raging with testosterone I would imagine.

If I wanted to take over the world (which I don't) this would be one of the steps, to force feminize the nation to destroy the alpha male, that would make it much easier. I can't imagine that this isn't by design and that nobody has thought of this except me, I am watching it happen.

I believe there are people who have a feminine spirit and born male, or a masculine spirit born female and the desire to have a body that fits the spirit is a real thing and being transgender is not unnatural, just look up native american's five genders. There is male body/male spirit, female body/female spirit, male body/female spirit, female body/male spirit, and the rare male&female spirit in either body known as two spirits (which I believe I fall under). Two spirit people are able to view the world through the eyes of both genders and have a unique perspective, they were medicine men, historians, musicians, shamans, and held a high place of honor amongst the native american people. A family with a two spirit was considered a great blessing. Children were free to express either gender and got to decide which right of passage they would choose when they were ready.

On the other hand I believe many people are genuinely just confused because they never got to experience natural hormone levels of their gender do to BPA in the plastic and identify with the gender they started to transition to first. A lot of boys will go through partial female puberty first though and that will shape their gender identity instead of the spirit and that seems wrong to me. If they had normal hormone levels they might have felt natural as their own gender with no dysphoria but that was stolen from them and all they ever knew was puberty from the wrong gender.

I never see anyone discuss this and I came up with this theory myself so maybe people just haven't noticed this happening yet and I though it might be important so I want to share my theory.

&#x200B;

Ever wonder what's really in the food sold at grocery stores around the world?

People keep asking me,

>""What ingredients should I avoid?""

So I put together a short list that covers all the most toxic and disease-promoting ingredients in the food supply. These are the substances causing cancer, diabetes, heart disease and leading to tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary health care costs across America (and around the world).  


If you want to stay healthy and out of the hospital, read ingredients labels and make sure you avoid all these ingredients:  
 

**Acrylamides**  
Toxic, cancer-causing chemicals formed in foods when carbohydrates are exposed to high heat (baking, frying, grilling).  
   
They're present in everything from bread crusts to snack chips, and because they aren't intentional ingredients, acrylamides do NOT have to be listed on labels.  
   
**Aspartame**  
[Aspartame](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/esp_salud23.htm) is a chemical sweetener that causes neurological disorders, seizures, blurred vision and migraine headaches.  
   
   
**Autolyzed Proteins**  
Highly processed form of protein containing free glutamate and used to mimic the taste-enhancer chemical MSG.  
   
**BPA (Bisphenol-A)**  
A hormone mimicking chemical found in nearly all food packaging plastics.  
   
Active in just parts per billion, BPA promotes cancer, infertility and hormone disorders. It also ""[feminizes"" males](http://www.naturalnews.com/032860_BPA_feminization.html), promoting male breast growth and hormone disruption.  
   
**Casein**  
Milk proteins. Hilariously, this is widely used in ""soy cheese"" products that claim to be alternatives to cow's milk. Nearly all of them are made with cow's milk proteins.  
   
**Corn Syrup**  
Just another name for High Fructose Corn Syrup (see below). Frequently used in infant formula products  
   
**Food Colors**  
FD&C Red #40, for example, is linked to behavioral disorders in children. Nearly all artificial food colors are derived from petroleum, and many are contaminated with aluminum.  
   
**Genetically Modified Ingredients**  
Not currently listed on the label because the GMO industry ([Monsanto](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_monsanto.htm) and [DuPont](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bloodlines/dupont.htm)) absolutely does not want people to know which foods contain GMOs.  
   
Nearly all conventionally grown corn, soy and cotton are GMOs. They're linked to severe infertility problems and may even cause the bacteria in your body to produce and release a pesticide in your own gut.  
   
If you're not eating organic corn, you're definitely [eating GMO](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_geneticfood.htm) corn. Learn more at [www.ResponsibleTechnology.org](http://www.responsibletechnology.org/)  
   
**High Fructose Corn Syrup**  
A highly processed liquid sugar extracted with the chemical solvent glutaraldehyde and frequently [contaminated with mercury](http://www.naturalnews.com/032948_high_fructose_corn_syrup_glutaraldehyde.html). It's also linked to diabetes, obesity and mood disorders.  
   
Used in thousands of grocery items, including things you wouldn't suspect like pizza sauce and salad dressings.  
   
**Homogenized Milk**  
The [fats in the milk are artificially modified](http://www.naturalnews.com/022967_milk_pasteurization_dairy.html) to change them into smaller molecules that stay in suspension in the milk liquid (so the milk fat doesn't separate).  
   
While it makes milk look better on the shelf, it's also blamed for promoting heart disease and may contribute to milk allergies. Raw milk is healthier, which is why the [government had outlawed it](http://www.naturalnews.com/029322_raw_milk_Amish.html).  
   
**Hydrochloride**  
When you see anything hydrochloride, such as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride or Thiamin Hydrochloride, those are chemical forms of B vitamins that companies add to their products to be able to claim higher RDA values of vitamins.  
   
But these are synthetic, chemical forms of vitamins, not real vitamins from foods or plants. Nutritionally, they are near-useless and may actually be bad for you.  
   
Also watch out for [niacinamide and cyanocobalamin](http://www.naturalnews.com/032766_cyanocobalamin_vitamin_B-12.html) (synthetic vitamin B-12).  
   
**Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein**  
A highly processed form of (usually) soy protein that's processed to bring out the free glutamate (MSG). Use as a taste enhancer.  
   
**Partially Hydrogenated Oils**  
Oils that are modified using a chemical catalyst to make them stable at room temperature. This creates [trans fatty acids](http://www.naturalnews.com/027445_fat_fats_trans.html) and greatly increases the risk of blocked arteries.  
   
It also promotes what I call ""sludge blood,"" which is thick, viscous blood that's hard to pump.  
   
This is usually diagnosed by doctors as ""high blood pressure"" and (stupidly) treated with blood-thinning medications that are [technically the same chemicals as rat poison](http://www.naturalnews.com/023149_drug_drugs_pharmas.html) (warfarin).  
   
**Phosphoric Acid**  
The acid used in sodas to dissolve the carbon dioxide and add to the overall fizzy-ness of the soda. Phosphoric acid will eat steel nails. It's also used by stone masons to etch rocks.  
   
The military uses it to clean the rust off battleships. In absolutely [destroys tooth enamel](http://www.naturalnews.com/021774.html). Search Google Images for ""Mountain Dew Mouth"" to see [photos of teeth rotted out](http://www.google.com/search?q=mountain+dew+mouth&hl=en&prmd=ivns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&biw=1024&bih=591) by phosphoric acid...  
   
**Propylene Glycol**  
A liquid used in the automotive industry to winterize RVs.  
   
It's also used to make the fake blueberries you see in blueberry muffins, bagels and breads. (Combined with artificial colors and corn syrup.) See shocking ""Fake Blueberries"" video:

**VIDEO WAS DELETED ...**

&#x200B;

 

**Sodium (Salt)**  
The processed white salt lacking in trace minerals. In the holistic nutrition industry, we call it ""death salt"" because it promotes disease and death.  
   
Real salt, on the other hand, such as ""dirty"" sea salt or pink Himalayan salt, is loaded with the trace minerals that prevent disease, such as selenium (cancer), chromium (diabetes) and zinc (infectious disease). Much like with bread and sugar, white salt is terrible for your health. And don't be fooled by claims of ""sea salt"" in grocery stores.  
   
All salt came from the sea if you go far back enough in geologic time, so they can slap the ""sea salt"" claim on ANY salt!  
   
**Sodium Nitrite**  
A cancer-causing red coloring chemical added to bacon, hot dogs, sausage, beef jerky, ham, lunch meats, pepperoni and nearly all processed meats.  
   
Strongly linked to [brain tumors, pancreatic cancers and colon cancers](http://www.naturalnews.com/007024.html). The USDA once tried to ban it from the food supply but was out-maneuvered by the meat industry, which now dominates USDA regulations. Sodium nitrite is a complete poison used to make meats look fresh.  
   
Countless children die of cancer each year from sodium nitrite-induced cancers.  
   
**Soy Protein**  
The No. 1 protein source used in ""protein bars,"" including many bars widely consumed by bodybuilders.  
   
Soy protein is the ""junk protein"" of the food industry. It's made from genetically modified soybeans (often grown in China) and then subjected to [hexane, a chemical solvent](http://www.naturalnews.com/026303_soy_protein_hexane.html) that can literally explode.  
   
**Sucralose**  
An artificial chemical sweetener sold as [Splenda](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_monsanto06.htm#Splenda). The sucralose molecule contains a chlorine atom. Researchers have repeatedly found that artificial sweeteners make people fat by actually promoting weight gain.  
   
**Sugar**  
The bleached, nutritionally-deficient byproduct of cane processing.  
   
During sugar cane processing, nearly all the minerals and vitamins end up in the blackstrap molasses that's usually fed to farm animals. (Blackstrap molasses is actually the ""good"" part of sugar cane juice.) Molasses is often fed to farm animals because every rancher knows that farm animals need good nutrition to stay alive.  
   
Amazingly, conventional doctors don't yet realize this about humans, and they continue to claim that eating sugar is perfectly fine for you. Sugar promotes diabetes, obesity, mood disorders and nutritional deficiencies.  
   
**Textured Vegetable Protein**  
Usually made of soy protein which is extracted from genetically modified soybeans and then processed using hexane, an explosive chemical solvent (see Soy Protein, above).  
   
Widely used in vegetarian foods such as ""veggie burgers"" (most of which also contain MSG or Yeast Extract, by the way).  
   
**Yeast Extract**  
Hidden form of MSG that contains free glutamate and is used in many ""natural"" food products to claim ""No MSG!""  
   
Yeast extract contains up to 14% free glutamate. You'll find it in thousands of grocery store products, from soups to snack chips. I even once spotted it used on fresh meat!

 

**Food label tricks**

Here's a trick food companies frequently used to pack more sugar into their products without making sugar look like the first ingredient:  


Ingredient labels, you see, must list the most prominent ingredients first, and some consumers might freak out of they saw a box of cereal that said, ""Sugar, whole grain wheat, corn"" and so on.

Instead, the company uses 3 or 4 different forms of sugar to distribute them farther down the label, like this:

>""Whole grain wheat, sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup solids...""

This way, the first ingredients looks like ""whole grain wheat"" when, in reality, the cereal might be over fifty percent sugars!  


**How to buy honest food**

>Shop at your local farmer's market, food co-op or CSA.  
   
In the USA, look for the USDA Organic label on foods. This is a legitimate claim to being certified organic. It's one of the few programs run by the USDA that actually has integrity.  
   
Read the ingredients labels! If you see names of chemicals you can't pronounce, don't buy it.  
   
Buy more unprocessed food ingredients and make your own meals rather than buying ready-to-eat, processed foods, which are almost universally formulated with disease-promoting ingredients.  
   
GROW some of [your own food](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_futurebeyond.htm)! The best food you can ever eat is food from your own garden.

22,10 facts about cholesterol your doctor doesn't tell you.,156.0,ubjkr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ubjkr5/10_facts_about_cholesterol_your_doctor_doesnt/,72.0,1650888318.0,"1. Cholesterol is an essential nutrient that makes up the cell membrane of every cell in the body. 
2. The human brain is over 50% fat and cholesterol by dry weight.

3. Vitamins A, D, and E are cholesterol molecules. 

4. LDL is a lipoprotein which carries cholesterol to the needed parts of the body. It is not a cholesterol nor is it 'bad'. It serves a very important function to all our cells that need cholesterol. 
5. HDL is also a lipoprotein which carries excess cholesterol from the cells back to the liver. It serves an important function and is no more 'good' or 'bad' than LDL.

6. The 'Total cholesterol' number your doctor gives you is a calculation done from your triglycerides, HDL, and LDL. The formula assumes every LDL and HDL molecule is saturated with cholesterol which usually isn't the case. It's like counting the population of a school by counting the busses. It's just an estimate.
7. If the body doesn't get enough cholesterol in the diet it will make its own. Which is why low cholesterol diets will barely put a dent on your cholesterol levels.
8. Since diet has low affect on cholesterol levels doctors push Statins, which prevent some of the body's manufacture of cholesterol.  Which is a pill you take for life.
9. Taking Statins and preventing your cells from getting an essential part it needs to function leads to side-effects you can expect. Confusion, memory loss, and drastic personality changes due to the brain being deprived, muscle aches due to the body cells being deprived, etc. Not to mention the other issues (kidney/heart/etc) taking statins for long periods can cause.


10. Eating unhealthy vegetable and seed oils  (e.g. soy, canola) replaces healthy lipids in your cells for less functional, more rigid ones, which can eventually lead to breakdown and the same issues as not getting enough cholesterol in the first place. Sadly these unhealthy oils get 'heart healthy' labels while healthy sources of fat (animal) get vilified, leading to the nation getting even sicker.

>According to BBC News:  
“The fluoride in the ash creates acid in the animals' stomachs, corroding the intestines and causing hemorrhages. It also binds with calcium in the bloodstream and after heavy exposure over a period of days makes bones frail, even causing teeth to crumble.”  
[**BBC News April 19, 2010**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8629241.stm)

Many may see this story and never *connect the dots* between the tragic poisoning of these animals due to a natural event, and the intentional poisoning of human beings through excessive fluoride exposure each and every day.  


This story is another clue that just because something exists in nature doesn't necessarily mean it is good for you. And this is certainly true for the seriously misguided use of fluoride to prevent dental cavities.  


The practice of adding fluoride to your tap water began in 1945. With more than 60 percent of U.S. water supplies currently fluoridated, chances are you’re one of the 170 million Americans who drink fluoride on a daily basis.  


Most likely, your dentist - along with countless government and public health officials - has praised and promoted the use of fluoride, both in toothpaste and drinking water, as one of your must-do regimens to promote strong and healthy teeth.  


Unfortunately, they’ve all bought the public deception, and have unwittingly participated in and perpetuated perhaps one of the grandest public health frauds and toxic cover-ups in U.S. history.  
 

**Fluoride - A Historically Known Toxin**  
Prior to 1945 when communal water fluoridation took effect, fluoride was a known toxin.  


For example, a 1936 issue of the *Journal of the American Dental Association* stated that fluoride at the 1 ppm (part per million) concentration is as toxic as arsenic and lead.  


The *Journal of the American Medical Association* stated in their [September 18, 1943](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/123/3/150-a) issue, that,

>“fluorides are general protoplasmic poisons that change the permeability of the cell membrane by certain enzymes.”

And, an editorial published in the *Journal of the American Dental Association*, October 1, 1944, stated,

>""Drinking water containing as little as 1.2 ppm fluoride will cause developmental disturbances. We cannot run the risk of producing such serious systemic disturbances. The potentialities for harm outweigh those for good.""

More recently, **Christopher Bryson**, award winning journalist and former producer at the BBC revealed the multi-tiered abuse of power by military and industry scientists and public health officials in his book [The Fluoride Deception](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/fluoride_deception%20.pdf).

In it, he describes the intertwined interests that existed in the 1940’s and 50’s between the aluminum industry, the U.S. nuclear weapons program, and the dental industry, which resulted in fluoride being declared not only safe, but “beneficial to human health.”  


The political back story of how fluoride was introduced into your drinking water reads like a cross between a psychological thriller and mind-boggling science fiction.  


Read Bryson’s book, and you’ll never think of fluoride the same again… Because the bottom line is that when you swallow fluoride, it does nothing to decrease disease, it merely accelerates it.  


**Do You Know What’s REALLY in Your Water?**  
What would you do if you suddenly found out that “fluoride,” which advocates claim is an all-natural element that you ingest anyway and is good for your teeth and bones, was not safe at all, but was actually a carcinogenic industrial waste?  


That’s right! The fluoride in your water supply is not what you think it is.  


The natural form of mineral fluoride found both in nature and in your teeth and bones, is called Apatite (calcium fluoro-chloro-hydroxyl phosphate).  


Inside your mouth, there is a natural equilibrium between hydroxyl-apatite (calcium phosphate) dissolving and forming in your tooth enamel from substances occurring naturally in your saliva. Like everything else, your diet and various physical conditions shift this equilibrium back and forth constantly.  


When you have more calcium phosphate dissolving than being adhered, you end up with a demineralization condition called caries. This is when cavities form in your teeth.  


However, this has nothing to do with fluoride or fluoridation, but a good fib must always start with a kernel of truth, or else no one will listen to you.  


So when it comes to the so-called “health benefits” of fluoride, it’s essential to understand what’s really being added to your water and other products you use on a regular basis, such as toothpaste.  


When “fluoride” is added to your drinking water, it’s NOT the natural mineral. Instead, the fluoride in question is another chemical fluoride compound – the toxic waste product from phosphate fertilizer plants.  


There are three basic compounds commonly used for fluoridating water supplies:

>Sodium fluoride (NaF)  
Sodium silicofluoride  
Hydrofluorosilicic acid

The last two, sodium silicofluoride and hydrofluorosilicic acid, are the compounds used for water fluoridation, with hydrofluorosilicic acid being the most commonly used additive, [according to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/fact_sheets/index.htm).  


These are chemical byproducts of aluminum, steel, cement, phosphate, and nuclear weapons manufacturing. Such fluoride is manmade, and in this form, fluoride has no nutrient value and no health benefits whatsoever.  


But there’s yet another tidbit that is not talked about openly, and that is the fact that these hazardous industrial wastes - the fluoride compounds actually added to your water - have NEVER been fully tested to ascertain their full potential health hazard.  


Instead, the pharmaceutical grade “sodium fluoride” (the first one on the list) is used in the majority of studies evaluating the risk to human health.  


Therefore, the real danger to your health may be far greater than any of the studies done so far have shown, and numerous studies have already identified the pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride as a toxic agent, capable of doing irreparable harm to your body.  
 

**Fluoride May Actually CAUSE More Cavities Than it Prevents!**  
Studies have also shown that fluoride does not even help prevent cavities, which is the number one reason for water fluoridation in the first place.  


Instead, studies have shown that consuming too much fluoride might actually cause tooth decay.  


One such study, published in the September 2001 issue of *International Journal of Pediatric Dentistry*, found that South African children who drank water containing high levels of natural fluoride (3 ppm), [had more tooth decay](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2001/09/26/dentists-cause-cavities.aspx) than children in other parts of South Africa who drank much lower concentrations (between 0.19 to 0.48 ppm).  


And fluoride-saturated American teenagers had twice the rate of cavities as the South African children drinking low levels of natural fluoride!  
 

**The Many Health Dangers of Fluoride**  
According to information from its *Material Safety Data Sheet* (MSDS), and from the *National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health* (NIOSH), the pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride is a dangerous toxin that can cause serious physical harm.  


The chemical targets your:

>Kidneys  
Heart  
Gastrointestinal system  
Bone and skeletal structures  
Teeth  
Nerves

The MSDS for sodium fluoride also states that fluoride compounds can induce:

>Systemic toxic effects on your heart, liver, and kidney  
Depleted calcium levels in your body leading to hypocalcaemia and death

It points out that the toxic effect of fluoride might be delayed, and that laboratory experiments have resulted in the development of tumors.  


In order to understand the long-term dangers of fluoride, it’s important to realize that fluoride is a cumulative poison.  


Ninety-eight percent of the fluoride you ingest in water is absorbed into your blood through your gastrointestinal tract. From there, it enters your body’s cellular tissues. On average, about 50 percent of the fluoride you ingest each day gets excreted through your kidneys. The remainder accumulates in your teeth and bones, pineal gland, and other tissues, such as the aorta.  


The amount deposited into your bones and teeth varies depending on your age. In children, more than 50 percent of an ingested dose of fluoride is deposited in bone, but in adults only about 10 percent is stored there.  


As with teeth, fluoride is deposited in bone by the ionic exchange with hydroxyl-apatite as mentioned earlier. It does dissolve from bone as well, but at a slower rate than it is deposited, so if your intake remains constant, the level of fluoride in your bones increases linearly with age.  


Therefore, if your kidneys are damaged, fluoride accumulation will increase, and with it, the likelihood of harm.  


There are numerous health problems associated with the accumulation of fluoride in your body, such as:

>Hyperactivity and/or lethargy  
Arthritis  
Dental fluorosis (staining and pitting of teeth)  
Lowered thyroid function  
Lowered IQ, and dementia  
Disrupted immune system

Fluoride also causes genetic damage and cell death, [inactivates at least 62 enzymes in your body](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/fluoride-controversy.aspx), and accelerates the aging process.  
 

**Overdosing is Easy**  
When water fluoridation first began, the “optimal” level of fluoride for dental benefit was said to be 1 mg/day for an adult male, based on the estimate that the average adult male drank one liter of water per day. However, even at that level, 10 percent of the population (those in the high-risk group) was expected to get [fluorosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis).  


But water is not the only source of added fluoride.  


Although you may not know it, you are exposed to fluoride from many sources other than the obvious lineup of toothpastes and mouth rinses.  


Far less obvious sources of fluoride include:

>Food and beverages processed with fluoridated water  
Mechanically de-boned meat  
Pesticide residue on food  
Pharmaceutical drugs, especially SSRI antidepressants and fluoroquinolone antibiotics like Cipro  
Soy baby formulas  
Instant tea

A 1991 review by the *U.S. Department of Health and Human Services* shows just how drastic your overexposure might be when taking multiple sources into account.

If you were to evaluate all the sources of fluoride you’re exposed to on a regular basis, you may be shocked by how much fluoride you and your children are actually ingesting.  


**Diet, Not Fluoride Builds Healthy Teeth**  
If you’re wondering how to keep your teeth healthy, remember that fluoride was never the answer in the first place.  


Instead, you need to look to your diet if you want healthy teeth. In fact, most people whose diet includes very little sugar and few processed foods have very low rates of tooth decay.  


Limiting or eliminating sugar, and avoiding processed foods and eating plenty of green vegetables and vitamin K2 - along with regular cleanings with your natural dentist - is the best way to ensure your teeth stay healthy naturally.",conspiracy,Soy

Here is a list of some FDA approved chemicals that they have approved in the name of ""profits"" for big companies and why you shouldn't trust something just cause it has a stamp of approval...


Banned Ingredients #1 — **Dough Conditioners**
Dough conditioners, such as potassium bromate and azodicarbonamide are chemicals used to improve the strength and texture of bread dough. Dough conditioners are often found in white breads, rolls, and “egg breads.” However, they are possible human carcinogens (potassium bromate is classified as a category 2B carcinogen). And exposure to them is known to cause respiratory sensitivity, such as asthma or other breathing difficulty. As such, potassium bromate is banned in China, India, Brazil, the European Union, and Canada. And azodicarbonamide is banned in Australia and Europe.

Banned Ingredients #2 — **Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)**
Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) was originally patented by chemical companies as a flame retardant. But now, BVO can be found in certain colorful sports drinks and citrus-flavored sodas as an emulsifier. Studies have shown that BVO isn’t harmless. It actually accumulates in human tissue, as well as breast milk, and can cause memory loss over time. Bromine toxicity can lead to skin rashes, appetite loss, and heart problems, as well as major organ damage and birth defects. Bromine also competes with iodine for receptor sites in the body, which can increase risk for iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease, and even certain cancers. And although BVO has been banned in countries like Japan, it’s been used in food and beverages in American since 1977 when it was approved by the FDA.

Banned Ingredients #3 — **Propylparaben**
In the United States, propylparaben is used as a preservative in tortillas, muffins, trail mix, pies, sausage rolls, and more. Research has found that it can affect sex hormones and sperm counts in young rats. Cornell University research had also indicated that exposure to parabens may be linked to breast cancer. Environmental Working Group senior scientist Johanna Congleton, Ph.D., tells us, “It is of great concern to us that the use of an endocrine-disrupting chemical in our food is considered safe by our own government… Studies show that chemicals that disrupt hormone signaling can lead to developmental and reproductive problems.” Propylparaben is totally legal in the U.S., but in 2006 the European Food Safety Authority banned the use of propylparaben in food. And in 2015, the EU went further – also banning propylparaben from cosmetic products.

Banned Ingredients #4 — **BHA and BHT**
BHA and BHT are popular man-made antioxidants used in dry mixes, cereals, and dehydrated potato products to preserve them and increase shelf life. They’re also found in product packaging. These are possible carcinogens and endocrine disruptors — meaning that they can alter the normal function of your hormones and lead to disease. BHA and BHT are banned for use in food and beverages by the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, and other countries.

Banned Ingredients #5 — **Synthetic Food Dye**
Food manufacturers use synthetic food dyes, such as blue 2, yellow 5, and red 40, to enhance the coloring of certain foods and ingredients to make them more appealing to consumers. Some foods that contain food dyes include beverages (like juices, sports drinks, and sodas), candy, and glazes used in baked goods and sweets. They’re even used in silly things like making mustard more yellow, salmon more pink, and jarred pickles the perfect shade of yellow-green. And don’t even get me started on maraschino cherries!

Research has linked consumption of synthetic dyes to an increased risk for numerous conditions, like tumors and hyperactivity in children. What’s even more infuriating is that the U.S. used to use natural food dyes until the mid-19th century. But then, food manufacturers realized it was much cheaper to use chemicals, which turned food even brighter colors.

Synthetic food dyes are banned in Europe and Australia, where more natural coloring compounds are used. For example, in most of the world, Fanta contains actual fruit juice and is dyed naturally. But Americans enjoy Fanta colored with petroleum-derived artificial dyes like red 40 and yellow 6.

Banned Ingredients #6 — **GMOs**
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been around since the 1980s. But they have become a controversial topic — and for good reason. While they’re widespread in the U.S. — with most U.S. soy, sugar beets, corn, canola, cotton, and alfalfa being GMO crops — many European countries have banned or regulated them due to public safety concerns.

One common genetic manipulation involves altering DNA in certain crops to make them resistant to herbicides. One of the most common herbicides used in conjunction with these GMOs is glyphosate, the primary active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup. Glyphosate consumption is linked to cancer. In fact, several people have won cases that allege glyphosate caused their cancer. Bayer, the manufacturer of Roundup, is currently fighting cancer lawsuits that involve over 13,000 people. As of June 2019, there were bans or major restrictions on use of glyphosate in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. 

Banned Ingredients #7 — **Roxarsone**
The arsenic-based drug roxarsone, was routinely used in chicken in the U.S. until July 2011, when Pfizer decided to stop selling it. However, there is no actual ban on the use of arsenic in the raising of chickens for food. Roxarsone was used to increase the pink coloring of raw chicken meat, to speed the growth of the birds before slaughter, and to prevent parasites in the chicken’s stomach. Research shows chronic exposure to arsenic can lead to anemia, skin lesions, kidney damage. It can also increase the risk for certain cancers, miscarriage, and birth defects. The European Union banned the use of arsenic-based drugs, while many chicken products in the U.S. still contain it.

Banned Ingredients #8 — **Ractopamine**
In the U.S., ractopamine is a muscle enhancer for pigs, cows, and turkeys. And, like other harmful substances used during the raising of animals, it doesn’t just go away when the animal is slaughtered. Some of it is still left in the meat you buy. Ractopamine is banned in 122 countries including Russia, mainland China, Taiwan, and many countries across Europe. This is because it’s been linked to reproductive and cardiovascular damage in humans, as well as chromosomal and behavioral changes.

Banned Ingredients #9 — **Herbicides, Insecticides, Fungicides**
Herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides are widely used on crops in the U.S. food system to keep them free of bugs and diseases. Meanwhile, other countries see (and act on) the danger they pose to humans. Of the 374 active ingredients authorized for agricultural use in the U.S. in 2016, the European Union banned 72 of them. Wow.

Banned Ingredients #10 — **Olestra**
Olestra, or Olean, is a cholesterol-free fat substitute created by Procter & Gamble. The FDA approved it for use in foods in the 1990s and it’s still used in certain potato chips and french fries. But Olestra may cause extremely unpleasant digestive reactions, like diarrhea and leaky bowels. Consuming a lot of it can also lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, as well as carotenoids. Both Canada and the United Kingdom have banned the ingredient.

Banned Ingredients #11 — **Synthetic Hormones**
Synthetic hormones, such as rBGH and rBST, are widely used in the U.S. dairy industry. The primary reason for this is to increase milk production in dairy cows. However, rBGH increases IGF-1 levels in humans and may increase the risk of developing cancer. Additionally, cows treated with rBGH are more likely to develop mastitis, an udder infection, requiring treatment with antibiotics. Canada, the EU, and other countries have banned these compounds.",conspiracy,Soy

27,Fluoride is even worse than what we thought,125.0,k279sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k279sj/fluoride_is_even_worse_than_what_we_thought/,46.0,1606503515.0,"by **Andreas Schuld**

About the Author  
.

**Andreas Schuld** is head of Parents of Fluoride Poisoned Children (PFPC), an organization of parents whose children have been poisoned by excessive fluoride intake. The group includes educators, artists, scientists, journalists and authors, lawyers, researchers and nutritionists. It is active in worldwide efforts to have the toxicity of fluoride properly assessed. For further information, visit their website at [www.bruha.com/fluoride](http://www.bruha.com/fluoride). 

In 1999 the US *Center for Disease Control* (**CDC**) released a glowing report on the fluoridation of public water supplies, citing the procedure as one of the century's great public health successes.1  


Ironically, the same report hints that the alleged benefit from fluorides may not be due to ingestion:

>""Fluoride's caries-preventive properties initially were attributed to changes in enamel during tooth development because of the association between fluoride and cosmetic changes in enamel and a belief that fluoride incorporated into enamel during tooth development would result in a more acid-resistant mineral.""

The CDC report then acknowledges new studies which indicate that the effects are ""topical"" rather than ""systemic.""

>""However, laboratory and epidemiologic research suggests that fluoride prevents dental caries predominately after eruption of the tooth into the mouth, and its actions primarily are topical for both adults and children.""

The obvious question is this: How can the CDC consider the addition of fluoride to public water supplies to be a *public health success* while admitting at the same time that fluoride's benefits are not ""systemic,"" in other words, are not obtained from drinking it?  


The truth, now becoming increasingly evident, is that fluoridation and the proclaimed benefit of fluoride as a way of preventing dental decay is perhaps the greatest ""scientific"" fraud ever perpetrated upon an unsuspecting public.  


Even worse, the relentless promotion of fluoride as a ""dental benefit"" is responsible for the huge neglect in proper assessment of its toxicity, an issue that has become a major concern for many nations. As there is no substance as biochemically active in the human organism as fluoride, excessive total intake of fluoride compounds might well be contributing to many diseases currently afflicting mankind, particularly those involving thyroid dysfunction. In the United States, most citizens are kept entirely ignorant of any adverse effect that might occur from exposure to fluorides.

Dental fluorosis, *the first visible sign that fluoride poisoning* *has occurred*, is declared a mere ""cosmetic effect"" by the dental profession, although the ""biochemical events which result in dental fluorosis are still unknown.""2,3,4 The quantity of fluoride needed to prevent caries but avoid dental fluorosis is also unknown.5  
 

**What is Fluoride?**  
Fluoride is any combination of elements containing the fluoride ion. In its elemental form, *fluorine is a pale yellow, highly toxic and corrosive gas*. In nature, fluorine is found combined with minerals as fluorides. It is the most chemically active nonmetallic element of all the elements and also has the most reactive electro-negative ion. Because of this extreme reactivity, fluorine is never found in nature as an uncombined element.  


Fluorine is a member of group VIIa of the periodic table. It readily displaces other halogens--such as chlorine, bromine and iodine--from their mineral salts. With hydrogen it forms hydrogen fluoride gas which, in a water solution, becomes hydrofluoric acid.  


There was no US commercial production of fluorine before World War II. A requirement for fluorine in the processing of uranium ores, needed for the atomic bomb, prompted its manufacture.6  


Fluorine compounds or fluorides are listed by the US *Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry* (**ATSDR**) as among the top 20 of 275 substances that pose the most significant threat to human health.7 In Australia, the *National Pollutant Inventory* (**NPI**) recently considered 400 substances for inclusion on the NPI reporting list. A risk ranking was given based on health and environmental hazard identification and human and environmental exposure to the substance. Some substances were grouped together at the same rank to give a total of 208 ranks. Fluoride compounds were ranked 27th out of the 208 ranks.8  


Fluorides, hydrogen fluoride and fluorine have been found in at least 130, 19, and 28 sites, respectively, of 1,334 National Priorities List sites identified by the *Environmental Protection Agency* (**EPA**).9 Consequently, under the provisions of the Superfund Act (CRECLA, 1986), a compilation of information about fluorides, hydrogen fluoride and fluorine and their effects on health was required. This publication appeared in 1993.9  


Fluorides are cumulative toxins. The fact that fluorides accumulate in the body is the reason that US law requires the Surgeon General to set a *Maximum Contaminant Level* (**MCL**) for fluoride content in public water supplies as determined by the EPA. This requirement is specifically aimed at avoiding a condition known as *Crippling Skeletal Fluorosis* (**CSF**), a disease thought to progress through three stages. The MCL, designed to prevent only the third and crippling stage of this disease, is set at 4ppm or 4mg per liter. It is assumed that people will retain half of this amount (2mg), and therefore 4mg per liter is deemed ""safe."" Yet a daily dose of 2-8mg is known to cause the third crippling stage of CSF.10,11  


In 1998 EPA scientists, whose job and legal duty it is to set the Maximum Contaminant Level, declared that this 4ppm level was set fraudulently by outside forces in a decision that omitted 90 percent of the data showing the mutagenic properties of fluoride.12  


The Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products, 5th Edition (1984) gives lead a toxicity rating of 3 to 4 (3 = moderately toxic, 4 = very toxic) and the EPA has set 0.015 ppm as the MCL for lead in drinking water--with a goal of 0.0ppm. The toxicity rating for fluoride is 4, yet the MCL for fluoride is currently set at 4.0ppm, over 250 times the permissible level for lead.  
 

**Water Fluoridation**  


In 1939 a dentist named **H. Trendley Dean**, working for the U.S. Public Health Service, examined water from 345 communities in Texas. Dean determined that high concentrations of fluoride in the water in these areas corresponded to a high incidence of mottled teeth. This explained why dentists in the area found mottled teeth in so many of their patients. Dean also claimed that there was a lower incidence of dental cavities in communities having about 1 ppm fluoride in the water supply. Among the native residents of these areas about 10 percent developed the very mildest forms of mottled enamel (""dental fluorosis""), which Dean and others described as ""beautiful white teeth.""  


Dean's report led to the initiation of artificial fluoridation of drinking water at 1part-per-million (ppm) in order to supply the ""optimal dose"" of 1mg fluoride per day--assuming that drinking four glasses of water every day would duplicate Dean's ""optimal"" intake for most people. Now, according to the American Dental Association, all people, rich or poor, could have ""beautiful white teeth"" and be free of caries at the same time. After all, the benefits of water fluoridation had been documented ""beyond any doubt.""13  


When other scientists investigated Dean's data, they did not reach the same conclusions. In fact, Dean had engaged in ""selective use of data,"" using findings from 21 cities that supported his case while completely disregarding data from 272 other locations that did not show a correlation.14 In court cases Dean was forced to admit under oath that his data were invalid.15 In 1957 he had to admit at AMA hearings that even waters containing a mere 0.1ppm (0.1 mg/l) could cause dental fluorosis, the first visible sign of fluoride overdose.16 Moreover, there is not one single double-blind study to indicate that fluoridation is effective in reducing cavities.17  
 

**So What's the Truth About Tooth Decay?**  


The truth is that more and more evidence shows that fluorides and dental fluorosis are actually associated with increased tooth decay. The most comprehensive US review was carried out by the National Institute of Dental Research on 39,000 school children aged 5-17 years.18 It showed no significant differences in terms of DMF (decayed, missing and filled teeth).

What it did show was that high decay cities (66.5-87.5 percent) have 9.34 percent more decay in the children who drink fluoridated water. Furthermore, a 5.4 percent increase in students with decay was observed when 1 ppm fluoride was added to the water supply. Nine fluoridated cities with high decay had 10 percent more decay than nine equivalent non-fluoridated cities.  


The world's largest study on dental caries, which looked at 400,000 students, revealed that decay increased 27 percent with a 1ppm fluoride increase in drinking water.19 In Japan, fluoridation caused decay increases of 7 percent in 22,000 students,20 while in the US a decay increase of 43 percent occured in 29,000 students when 1ppm fluoride was added to drinking water.21  
 

**Dental Fluorosis: A ""Cosmetic"" Defect?**  
Dental fluorosis is a condition caused by an excessive intake of fluorides, characterized mainly by mottling of the enamel (which starts as ""white spots""), although the bones and virtually every organ might also be affected due to fluoride's known anti-thyroid characteristics. Dental fluorosis can only occur during the stage of enamel formation and is therefore a sign that an overdose of fluoride has occurred in a child during that period.  


*Dental fluorosis* has been described as a subsurface enamel *hypomineralization*, with porosity of the tooth positively correlated with the degree of fluorosis.22 It is characterized by diffuse opacities and under-mineralized enamel. Although identical enamel defects occur in cases of thyroid dysfunction, the dental profession describes the defect as merely ""cosmetic"" when it is caused by exposure to fluoride.  


What is now becoming apparent is that this ""cosmetic"" defect actually predisposes to tooth decay. In 1988 Duncan23 stated that hypoplastic defects have a strong potential to become carious. In 1989, Silberman,24 evaluating the same data on Head Start children, wrote that ""preliminary data indicate that the presence of primary canine hypoplasia \[enamel defects\] may result in an increased potential for the tooth becoming carious.""

In 1996 Li 25 wrote that children with enamel hypoplasia demonstrated a significantly higher caries experience than those who did not have such defects and, further, that the ""presence of enamel hypoplasia may be a predisposing factor for initiation and progression of dental caries, and a predictor of high caries susceptibility in a community."" In 1996 Ellwood & O'Mullane26 stated that ""developmental enamel defects may be useful markers of caries susceptibility, which should be considered in the risk-benefit assessment for use of fluoride.""  


Currently up to 80 percent of US children suffer from some degree of dental fluorosis, while in Canada the figure is up to 71 percent. A prevalence of 80.9 percent was reported in children 12-14 years old in Augusta, Georgia, the highest prevalence yet reported in an ""optimally"" fluoridated community in the United States. Moderate-to-severe fluorosis was found in 14 percent of the children.27  


Before the push for fluoridation began, the dental profession recognized that fluorides were not beneficial but detrimental to dental health. In 1944, the Journal of the American Dental Association reported: ""With 1.6 to 4 ppm fluoride in the water, 50 percent or more past age 24 have false teeth because of fluoride damage to their own.""28  
 

**The Wonder Nutrient?**  
On countless internet sites, fluoride is proclaimed as the ""wonder nutrient,"" the ""deficiency"" symptom being increased dental caries.29 It boggles the mind that a cumulative toxin and toxic waste product can be described a ""nutrient."" Nevertheless, such claims are repeatedly made by pro-fluoridationists.30  


On March 16, 1979, the FDA deleted paragraphs 105.3(c) and 105.85(d)(4) of Federal Register documents which had classified fluorine, among other substances, as ""essential"" or ""probably essential."" Since that time, nowhere in the Federal Regulations is fluoride classified as ""essential"" or ""probably essential."" These deletions were the immediate result of 1978 Court deliberations.31 No essential function for fluoride has ever been proven in humans.32,33,34,35,36  
 

**""Nature Thought of It First""**  


A popular slogan employed by the ADA and other pro-fluoridation organizations is, ""Nature thought of it first!"" The slogan creates the impression that the fluoridation compounds used in water fluoridation are the same as those discovered many years ago in the water in some areas of the US.37 The fluoride compound in ""naturally"" fluoridated waters is calcium fluoride. Sodium fluoride, a common fluoridation agent, dissolves easily in water, but calcium fluoride does not.9  


Animal studies performed by **Kick** and others in 1935 revealed that sodium fluoride was much more toxic than calcium fluoride.38 Even worse, toxicity was recorded for *hydrofluorosilicic acid*, the compound now used in over 90 percent of fluoridation programs, Hydrofluorosilicic acid is a direct byproduct of pollution scrubbers used in the phosphate fertilizer and aluminum industries. Our government adds it to water supplies even though it is also involved in getting rid of its own stockpile of fluoride compounds left over from years and years of stockpiling fluorides for use in the process of refining uranium for nuclear power and weapons.39  


In the Kick study, less than 2 percent of calcium fluoride was absorbed and this was excreted quantitatively in the urine. But even calcium fluoride is not benign. As the animals given calcium fluoride also developed mottled teeth, it was clear that such compounds could produce changes on the teeth merely by passing through the body, and not by being ""stored in a tooth"" or anywhere else. No calcium fluoride was retained.  


In 1946 Samuel Chase, one of the authors of the Kick study, became president of the International Association for Dental Research (IADR). This organization promoted the idea that only the fluoride ion in the various fluoridation compounds was of importance. Yet he well knew that sodium fluoride did not behave like calcium fluoride. Unlike calcium fluoride, sodium fluoride was retained in great amounts in the body and was very toxic. Rock phosphate and hydro-fluorosilicic acid experiments yielded the same information.  


New areas with ""natural"" fluoride are appearing all over the world, as now all areas not ""artificially"" fluoridated are considered ""natural."" The problem is that this ""natural"" fluoride is the result of direct water and soil contamination from petrochemical land treatment, uncontrolled fertilizer use, pesticide applications, ground water contamination from industrial waste sites, rocket fuel ""burial grounds,"" and so forth. Suddenly we have ""natural"" fluorides showing up in areas previously deemed ""fluoride deficient""!  
 

**Total Intake**  


It is well established that it is TOTAL fluoride intake from ALL sources which must be considered for any adverse health effect evaluation.40,41,42 This includes intake by ingestion, inhalation and absorption through the skin. In 1971, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated:

>""In the assessment of the safety of a water supply with respect to the fluoride concentration, the total daily fluoride intake by the individual must be considered.""41

Exposure to airborne fluorides from many diverse manufacturing processes--pesticide applications, phosphate fertilizer production, aluminum smelting, uranium enrichment facilities, coal-burning and nuclear power plants, incinerators, glass etching, petroleum refining and vehicle emissions--can be considerable.  


In addition, many people consume fluorine-based medications such as Prozac, which greatly adds to fluoride's anti-thyroid effects. ALL fluoride compounds--organic and inorganic--have been shown to exert anti-thyroid effects, often potentiating fluoride effects many fold.43  


Household exposures to fluorides can occur with the use of Teflon pans, fluorine-based products, insecticides sprays and even residual airborne fluorides from fluoridated drinking water. Decision-makers at 3M Corporation recently announced a phase-out of Scotchgard products after discovering that the product's primary ingredient--a fluorinated compound called perfluorooctanyl sulfonate (PFOS)--was found in all tested blood bank examinations.44 3M's research showed that the substance had strong tendencies to persist and bio-accumulate in animal and human tissue.  


In 1991 the US Public Health Service issued a report stating that the range in total daily fluoride intake from water, dental products, beverages and food items exceeded 6.5 milligrams daily.42 Thus, the total intake from those sources alone already greatly exceeds the levels known to cause the third stage of skeletal fluorosis.  


Besides fluoridated water and toothpaste, many foods contain high levels of flouride compounds due to pesticide applications. One of the worse offenders is grapes.45 Grape juice was found to contain more than 6.8 ppm fluoride. The EPA estimates total fluoride intake from pesticide residues on food and fluoridated drinking water alone to be 0.095 mg/kg/day, meaning a person weighing 70 kg takes in more than 6.65 mg per day.45b Soy infant formula is high in both fluoride and aluminum, far surpassing the ""optimal"" dose46,47 and has been shown to be a risk factor in dental fluorosis.48  
 

**Tea**  


In their drive to fluoridate the public water supplies, dental health officials continue to pretend that no other sources of fluoride exist. This notion becomes absurd when one looks at the fluoride content in tea. Tea is very high in fluoride because tea leaves accumulate more fluoride (from pollution of soil and air) than any other edible plant.49,50,51 It is well established that fluoride in tea gets absorbed by the body in a manner similar to the fluoride in drinking water.49,52  


Fluoride content in tea has risen dramatically over the last 20 years due to industry contamination. Recent analyses have revealed a fluoride content of 17.25 mg per teabag or cup in black tea, and a whopping 22 mg of soluble fluoride ions per teabag or cup in green tea. Aluminum content was also high--over 8 mg. Normal steeping time is five minutes. The longer a tea bag steeped, the more fluoride and aluminum were released. After ten minutes, the measurable amounts of fluoride and aluminum almost doubled.53  


A website by a pro-fluoridation infant medical group states that a cup of black tea contains 7.8 mgs of fluoride54 which is the equivalent amount of fluoride from 7.8 liters of water in an area fluoridated at 1ppm. Some British and African studies from the 1990s showed a daily fluoride intake of between 5.8 mgs and 9 mgs a day from tea alone.55, 56, 57 Tea has been found to be a primary cause of dental fluorosis in many international studies.58-70  


In Britain, over three-quarters of the population over the age of ten years consumes three cups of tea per day.71Yet the UK government and the British Dental Association are currently contemplating fluoridation of public water supplies! In Ireland, average tea consumption is four cups per day and the drinking water is heavily fluoridated.  


Next to water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world. Tea can be found in almost 80 percent of all US households and on any given day, nearly 127 million people--half of all Americans--drink tea.71  


The high content of both aluminum and fluoride in tea is cause for great concern as aluminum greatly potentiates fluoride's effects on G protein activation,72 the on/off switches involved in cell communication and of absolute necessity in thyroid hormone function and regulation.  
 

**Fluoride and the Thyroid**  
The recent re-discovery of hundreds of papers dealing with the use of fluorides in effective anti-thyroid medication poses many questions demanding answers.73,74 The enamel defects observed in hypothyroidism are identical to ""dental fluorosis."" Endemic fluorosis areas have been shown to be the same as those affected with iodine deficiency, considered to be the world's single most important and preventable cause of mental retardation,75 affecting 740 million people a year.

Iodine deficiency causes brain disorders, cretinism, miscarriages and goiter, among many other diseases. Synthroid, the drug most commonly prescribed for hypothyroidism, became the top selling drug in the US in 1999, according to Scott-Levin's Source Prescription Audit, clearly indicating that hypothyroidism is a major health problem. Many more millions are thought to have undiagnosed thyroid problems.  
 

**Environment**  


Every year hundreds and thousands of tons of fluorides are emitted by industry. Industrial emissions of fluoride compounds produce elevated concentrations in the atmosphere. Hydrogen fluoride can exist as a particle, dissolving in clouds, fog, rain, dew, or snow. In clouds and moist air it will travel along the air currents until it is deposited as wet acid deposition (acid rain, acid fog, etc.) In waterways it readily mixes with water.  


Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), emitted by the electric power industry, is now among six greenhouse gases specifically targeted by the international community, through the Kyoto protocol, for emission reductions to control global warming. The others are carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), methane and nitrous oxide (N2O).  


SF6 is about 23,900 times more destructive, pound for pound, than carbon dioxide over the course of 100 years. EPA estimates that some seven-million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) escaped from electric power systems in 1996 alone. The concentration of SF6 in the atmosphere has reportedly increased by two orders of magnitude since 1970. Atmospheric models have indicated that the lifetime of an SF6 molecule in the atmosphere may be over 3000 years.76  


The ever-increasing fluoride levels in food, water and air pose a great threat to human health and to the environment as evidenced by the endemic of fluorosis worldwide. It is of utmost urgency that public health officials cease promoting fluoride as beneficial to our health and address instead the issue of its toxicity.

>· Accelerated aging  
· Immune system dysfunction  
· Compromised collagen synthesis  
· Cartilage problems  
· Bony outgrowths in the spine  
· Joint ""lock-up""

**G Proteins**

>Signals or communications from one cell to another, and from the outside of the cell to the inside, are made possible by the action of special proteins called ""G"" proteins, which are found in all animal life, including yeasts. *G proteins* are so called because they bind to guanine nucleotides, a major component of DNA and RNA. *G proteins* mediate the actions of neurotransmitters, peptide hormones, odorants and light. In other words, *G proteins* make it possible for our nervous systems to function properly and, in particular, allow for night vision and the sense of smell.  
   
All thyroid function is mediated by G-protein activity. Both aluminum and fluoride interfere with the activation of *G proteins*. Thyrotropin, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), is considered the natural *G-protein* activator. Its action is mimicked by fluoride and vastly potentiated by the presence of aluminum. Pharmacologists estimate that up to 60 percent of all medicines used today exert their effects through *G-protein* signaling pathways. Vitamin A from cod liver oil has been used successfully to bypass blocked G-protein pathways due to vaccination damage. (See Autism and Vaccinations.)  
   
Myristic acid, a saturated fatty acid having 14 carbons, plays an important roll in G-protein function as these signaling proteins require myristic acid added to one end of the protein. (See Kidney Fats.) Thus, diets deficient in vitamin A and saturated fats can be expected to contribute to nervous disorders and vision problems.",conspiracy,Soy

They are mentioned 183 times in this document from the CIA's website.

Dupont doesn't just make industrial chemicals, they also make food additives. Here is a list of what they produce.

-Alginate
-Antimicrobials 
-Antioxidants
-Carrageenan
-Cellulose Gum
-Dairy Cultures
-Dietary Fibers
-Pectin
-Probiotics
-Rare Sugars
-Soy Protein
-Sweeteners

-Guar Gum
-Locust Bean Gum
-Meat Cultures
-Medium Chain Triglycerides
-Microcrystalline Cellulose

More can be seen on their website http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/food-ingredients.html

This means that if you are in the US, almost all of those long scientific words on the ingredient list of your food comes from DuPont. If you buy supplements, the microcrystalline cellulose filler most likely came from DuPont. Unless you're eating food you grew yourself or bought at a local farmers market, you are consuming their products. 
This also goes for soaps and shampoos and other household products who contain their chemical ingredients. 

That makes it incredibly easy for nearly the entire population to be inoculated with whatever these NWO people want. From a virus to smart dust. They could also pick and choose locations where they want this inoculation to happen by using their distribution network. It would also make it easier to use computer algorithms to determine the outcome of this inoculation. 

Bill Gates keeps saying that there will be a new plague that could kill 30 million in the first 6 months. This would be a perfect way to do it. 
After finding out this information I've decided to increase the size of my garden and learn new food storage methods so I can only eat what I grow myself. I also avoid anything other than homemade hygiene products. But there is really no way to avoid it if they do put something in their additives. Your best bet would be to make sure your immune system is as good as it can be and try to keep a healthy lifestyle.  ",conspiracy,Soy
30,These mRNA vaccines are a depopulation scheme but it might not be in the way you might think. Just a theory.....,112.0,10hhevx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/10hhevx/these_mrna_vaccines_are_a_depopulation_scheme_but/,125.0,1674271379.0,"This is long, but complicated issues can't be relayed in sound-bites. So save the TLDR, just move along without comment cause I don't give a shit if you don't want to read, much less be told of your desire not to do so.

Everything these people have done has been born from long-range plans. Sure the mRNA vaccines are inflicting damage in the immediate sense but what is more alarming is the potential damage done down-the-road. The miscarriages are part of it. The fact that the vaccine has been found in concentrations in the ovaries and testes should give everyone pause. 

They may be aiming for depopulation and sterilizing en masse will make it a reality. It will just take 10 or 15 years to fully see the impact.

As relates to the vaccine specifically there was a meeting that was attended by (I think) Dr. Malone in NYC. He was invited by a group of Orthodox Jewish Rabbis. What he learned was that in that culture the menstrual cycles of every women is documented meticulously. Everyone. From memory there was 90 rabbis each with their own group they monitored. They were stating that the cycles of their women went haywire upon starting the vaccines. Child-producing-aged women were either suffering from no periods or when they did they were bad. Lots of bleeding, cramping and not in small numbers. In addition the post-menopausal women began to have their periods again. This is a large cohort of people (again memory) around 1600 or so. They literally had log books. The traditions are adhered to at a level seldom understood by our crazy, fast-paced world.

The ""studies"" performed during the ""trials"" conducted by Pfizer etal were shocking as well. I can't remember the numbers but I know that upwards of 2/3rds of the participants dropped out of the program and were never tracked down for results. This would indicate a negative outcome of the term. Of those that they did track, it wasn't much better.

Natal nurses as well as intensive care natal wards have been reporting incredible numbers of still-births, spontaneous abortions and deformations.      

There is definitely circumstantial evidence for this plan, even outside of the vaccine. Mosquitos that have been genetically modified by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and released in Florida ring any bells? They fucked with the reproductive systems in an attempt to interrupt the life-cycle of the insect. 

How about the introduction of sterilization products in vaccines supplied to 3rd world African nations? The B&MG Foundation was found to be doing so by doctors from those nations. They sent samples out for analysis and found known sterilization chemicals present. It was in tetanus (I think it was tetanus) shots.

Want more? Bill has a stake in Monsanto. Monsanto produced the ""Suicide"" seed. That little gem produces crops that matures yet never produces seeds. Farmers in India literally killed themselves over the conditions this created for them (they were literally banned from use there). Could this food be having an influence on the consumer's reproductive systems? 

If you are still reading there's one more bit that I found interesting.....in 1997 (I think, going from memory) there was a study undertaken where pig farmers fed their herds exclusively with plants produced from suicide seeds, 100%. What was the result? Herds were wiped out when they were suffering massive losses in the form of false pregnancies and loads of miscarriages. The pig farmers that took part in the study were bankrupted.

Now if you look at the testosterone levels in men these days it might not all be because of the soy-boy shit (tips hat to all you vegans) even though you are what you eat. What if the food supply is responsible in a genetically modified way? Men have been seeing low sperm counts and fertility medicine has boomed in the last 3 decades to unprecedented levels. 

Why directly kill everyone when you can just stop reproduction? They have all the time in the world, they just need a way to get it into everyone. Hell it might be that the genetic modification won't get us but be born into our offspring. These people have been following a very long-term plan and have proven they can follow through with it spanning decades, possibly centuries.

&#x200B;

Since sometime around the 1970s, seed oil (commonly known as vegetable oil) consumption has exploded and alongside it, so have a miriad of diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, alzheimers, etc.

&#x200B;

The amount of land required to grow the crops that go into creating seed oils (not to mention the space the factories that produce them are taking up) is astronomical due to the amount of grains that go into these products.

&#x200B;

It takes hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of individual grains to amount to just a few table spoons of seed oil.

&#x200B;

This kind of land use in unfeasible and is much more efficiently used to grow crops/raise livestock that produce healthy fats (as opposed to the polyunsaturated fat rich seed oils).

&#x200B;

Fats from products like butter (and ghee), pasture fed tallow/lard, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, etc are much better for your body and have a lower polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) content.

&#x200B;

PUFAs/linoleic acid are linked to inflammation, as well as the other diseases mentioned in the first part (plus other disease, as I stated).

&#x200B;

Switch to a diet of healthy fats and cut out seed oils.

&#x200B;

You will have to go without a lot of processed food as seed oils are an additive in just about every single pre-processed food stuff you can buy at the store.

  
Find brands that do not use them in their products if you want the ease of processed foods (seeing as there's nothing inherently wrong with that).

--A US Department of Agriculture report confirmed the poor yield performance of GM crops, saying, **“GE [genetically engineered] crops available for commercial use do not increase the yield potential of a variety. In fact, yield may even decrease.... Perhaps the biggest issue raised by these results is how to explain the rapid adoption of GE crops when farm financial impacts appear to be mixed or even negative.”**

--The definitive study to date on GM crops and yield is Failure to Yield, by Dr Doug Gurian-Sherman, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists and former biotech adviser to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The study, which is based on peer-reviewed research and official US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, was the first to tease out the contribution of genetic engineering to yield performance from the gains made through conventional breeding. It is important to bear in mind when evaluating the yield performance of GM crops that biotech companies insert their proprietary GM genes into the best-performing conventionally bred varieties.

--The study also differentiated between intrinsic and operational yield. Intrinsic or potential yield, the highest that can be achieved, is obtained when crops are grown under ideal conditions. In contrast, operational yield is obtained under field conditions, when environmental factors such as pests and stress result in yields that are considerably less than ideal. Genes that improve operational yield reduce losses from such factors.

--The study found that **GM technology has not raised the intrinsic yield of any crop. The intrinsic yields of corn and soybeans did rise during the twentieth century, but this was not as a result of GM traits, but due to improvements brought about through traditional breeding.**

--The study found that GM soybeans did not increase operational yields, either. GM maize increased operational yields only slightly, mostly in cases of heavy infestation with European corn borer. Bt maize offered little or no advantage when infestation with European corn borer was low to moderate, even when compared with conventional maize that was not treated with insecticides.

--The study concluded, **“Commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”**

--In 2009, in an apparent attempt to counter criticisms of low yields from its GM soy, GM seed producer Monsanto released its new generation of supposedly high-yielding GM soybeans, RR2 Yield. But a study carried out in five US states involving 20 farm managers who planted RR2 soybeans in 2009 concluded that the new varieties “didn’t meet their [yield] expectations”.7 In June 2010 the state of West Virginia launched an investigation of Monsanto for false advertising claims that RR2 soybeans gave higher yields. “Commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”

Doug Gurian-Sherman, former biotech advisor to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, DC2, stated:

--If GM cannot increase yields even in the United States, where high-input, irrigated, heavily subsidised commodity farming is the norm, it is irresponsible to assume that it would improve yields in the Global South, where farmers may literally bet their farms and livelihoods on a crop. **We agree with the conclusion of Failure to Yield that the funding and research that are currently poured into trying to produce high-yield GM crops should be redirected toward approaches that are proven effective in improving crop yields, including conventional plant breeding as well as use of agroecological practices. These are by far the most efficient, affordable, and widely practised methods of improving yield.**

Can you dweebs get a better argument already?

None of you knew that ICUs in Ontario Canada were ALWAYS fucking overcrowded, just ask literally ANYONE who tried to get a surgery before. Surgeries were ALWAYS backlogged and Canada has had a shortage of doctors and medical staff for DECADES. People very regularly die on waiting lists and the government covers it up. The government here spends VERY little on the wonderful \*free healthcare\* us Canadians gloat about, and the money is funneled up to corrupt politicians and corporate lobbyists SHOCKER /s.

If you've ever lived in Canada or Ontario you've seen long lineups at EVERY single government office extending into a fucking McDonalds parking lot so far you could probably order a coffee waiting in line. Funny how ""taking care of everybody"" just ends up with everyone jumping for the scraps they get like seagulls on sweet potato fries and told to go home when they run out of services.

But I mean who the actual fuck sits around the coffee table gossiping about bed capacity in Intensive Care Units inside hospitals except maybe the people who play bingo down at the retirement home? You know, because they could easily end up there? Yet I see all you soy boys and girls taking it upon yourself to make this YOUR issue and YOUR fight when it's NOT. It's the responsibility of the government, it's the responsibility of medical professionals, and it's the responsibility of people to take care of their OWN health. That means actually take care of your health, not getting a 5 minute vaccine shot and acting like you've achieved eternal life.

Hold the government accountable for once in your damn lives, stop pointing the finger at the Anti-Vaxx boogeyman the government conveniently created for you. Stop believing everything the media tells you. Most people in the ICU whether vaccinated or not are people who were on their way out of this world right turning onto the exit ramp, people who for whatever reason are frail and set to die one way or another.

39,7 Foods That Should Never Cross Your Lips,81.0,meks45,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/meks45/7_foods_that_should_never_cross_your_lips/,38.0,1616873399.0," by **Anne Underwood**

>Is your food loaded with toxins and chemicals? Here, simple swaps to protect yourself

 

**Which foods should you avoid?**

Clean eating means choosing fruits, vegetables, and meats that are raised, grown, and sold with minimal processing.

Often they're organic, and rarely (if ever) should they contain additives. But in some cases, the methods of today's food producers are neither clean nor sustainable.

The result is damage to our health, the environment, or both. So we decided to take a fresh look at food through the eyes of the people who spend their lives uncovering what's safe - or not - to eat.

We asked them a simple question:

>""What foods do you avoid?""

Their answers don't necessarily make up a ""banned foods"" list.

But reaching for the suggested alternatives might bring you better health - and peace of mind.  
 

1. Canned Tomatoes  
Fredrick Vom Saal, PhD, an endocrinologist at the University of Missouri who studies [bisphenol-A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A), gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
The resin linings of tin cans contain bisphenol-A, a synthetic estrogen that has been linked to ailments ranging from reproductive problems to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, acidity (a prominent characteristic of tomatoes) causes BPA to leach into your food.  
   
Studies show that the BPA in most people's body exceeds the amount that suppresses sperm production or causes chromosomal damage to the eggs of animals.  
""You can get 50 mcg of BPA per liter out of a tomato can, and that's a level that is going to impact people, particularly the young,"" says vom Saal. ""I won't go near canned tomatoes.""  
**The solution:**  
Choose tomatoes in glass bottles (which do not need resin linings), such as the brands Bionaturae and Coluccio. You can also get several types in [Tetra Pak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra_Pak) boxes, like Trader Joe's and Pomi.  
**Budget tip:**  
If your recipe allows, substitute bottled pasta sauce for canned tomatoes. Look for pasta sauces with low sodium and few added ingredients, or you may have to adjust the recipe.  
2. Corn-Fed Beef  
Joel Salatin, co-owner of [Polyface Farms](http://www.polyfacefarms.com/) and author of half a dozen books on sustainable farming, gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
Cattle evolved to eat grass, not grains. But farmers today feed their animals corn and soybeans, which fatten up the animals faster for slaughter. But more money for cattle farmers (and lower prices at the grocery store) means a lot less nutrition for us.  
   
A recent comprehensive study conducted by the USDA and researchers from Clemson University found that compared with corn-fed beef, grass-fed beef is higher in beta-carotene, vitamin E, omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), calcium, magnesium, and potassium; lower in inflammatory omega-6s; and lower in saturated fats that have been linked to heart disease.  
""We need to respect the fact that cows are herbivores, and that does not mean feeding them corn and chicken manure,"" says Salatin.  
**The solution:**  
Buy grass-fed beef, which can be found at specialty grocers, farmers' markets, and nationally at Whole Foods. It's usually labeled because it demands a premium, but if you don't see it, ask your butcher.  
**Budget tip:**  
Cuts on the bone are cheaper because processors charge extra for deboning. You can also buy direct from a local farmer, which can be as cheap as $5 per pound. To find a farmer near you, search [eatwild.com](http://www.eatwild.com/).  
3. Microwave Popcorn  
Olga Naidenko, PhD, a senior scientist for the [Environmental Working Group](http://www.ewg.org/), gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
Chemicals, including *perfluorooctanoic acid* ([PFOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid)), in the lining of the bag, are part of a class of compounds that may be linked to infertility in humans, according to a recent study from UCLA. In animal testing, the chemicals cause liver, testicular, and pancreatic cancer.  
   
Studies show that microwaving causes the chemicals to vaporize - and migrate into your popcorn.  
""They stay in your body for years and accumulate there,"" says Naidenko, which is why researchers worry that levels in humans could approach the amounts causing cancers in laboratory animals.  
[DuPont](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bloodlines/dupont.htm) and other manufacturers have promised to phase out PFOA by 2015 under a voluntary EPA plan, but millions of bags of popcorn will be sold between now and then.  
**The solution:**  
Pop natural kernels the old-fashioned way: in a skillet. For flavorings, you can add real butter or dried seasonings, such as dillweed, vegetable flakes, or soup mix.  
**Budget tip:**  
Popping your own popcorn is dirt cheap.  
4. Nonorganic Potatoes  
Jeffrey Moyer, chair of the [National Organic Standards Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organic_Standards_Board), gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
Root vegetables absorb herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides that wind up in soil.  
   
In the case of potatoes - the nation's most popular vegetable - they're treated with fungicides during the growing season, then sprayed with herbicides to kill off the fibrous vines before harvesting.  
   
After they're dug up, the potatoes are treated yet again to *prevent them from* *sprouting*.  
""Try this experiment: Buy a conventional potato in a store, and try to get it to sprout. It won't,"" says Moyer, who is also farm director of the Rodale Institute (also owned by Rodale Inc., the publisher of Prevention).  
   
""I've talked with potato growers who say point-blank they would never eat the potatoes they sell. They have separate plots where they grow potatoes for themselves without all the chemicals.""  
**The solution:**  
Buy organic potatoes. Washing isn't good enough if you're trying to remove chemicals that have been absorbed into the flesh.  
**Budget tip:**  
Organic potatoes are only $1 to $2 a pound, slightly more expensive than conventional spuds.  
   
5. Farmed Salmon  
David Carpenter, MD, director of the [Institute for Health and the Environment](http://www.albany.edu/ihe/) at the University at Albany and publisher of a major study in the journal Science on contamination in fish, gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
Nature didn't intend for salmon to be crammed into pens and fed soy, poultry litter, and hydrolyzed chicken feathers. As a result, farmed salmon is lower in vitamin D and higher in contaminants, including carcinogens, PCBs, brominated flame retardants, and pesticides such as dioxin and DDT.  
   
According to Carpenter, the most contaminated fish come from Northern Europe, which can be found on American menus.  
""You could eat one of these salmon dinners every 5 months without increasing your risk of cancer,"" says Carpenter, whose 2004 fish contamination study got broad media attention. ""It's that bad.""  
Preliminary science has also linked DDT to diabetes and obesity, but some nutritionists believe the benefits of omega-3s outweigh the risks.  
   
There is also concern about the high level of antibiotics and pesticides used to treat these fish. When you eat *farmed salmon*, you get dosed with the same drugs and chemicals.  
**The solution:**  
Switch to wild-caught Alaska salmon. If the package says *fresh Atlantic*, it's farmed. There are no commercial fisheries left for wild Atlantic salmon.  
**Budget tip:**  
Canned salmon, almost exclusively from wild catch, can be found for as little as $3 a can.  
   
6. Milk Produced with Artificial Hormones  
Rick North, project director of the [Campaign for Safe Food](http://www.psr.org/chapters/oregon/safe-food/campaign-for-safe-food.html) at the *Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility* and former CEO of the Oregon division of the *American Cancer Society*, gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
Milk producers treat their dairy cattle with recombinant [bovine growth hormone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_Growth_Hormone) (rBGH or rBST, as it is also known) to boost milk production. But rBGH also increases udder infections and even pus in the milk. It also leads to higher levels of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor in milk.  
   
In people, high levels of IGF-1 may contribute to breast, prostate, and colon cancers.  
""When the government approved rBGH, it was thought that IGF-1 from milk would be broken down in the human digestive tract,"" says North.  
As it turns out, the casein in milk protects most of it, according to several independent studies.  
""There's not 100% proof that this is increasing cancer in humans,"" admits North. ""However, it's banned in most industrialized countries.""  
**The solution:**  
Check labels for rBGH-free, rBST-free, produced without artificial hormones, or organic milk. These phrases indicate rBGH-free products.  
**Budget tip:**  
Try Wal-Mart's Great Value label, which does not use rBGH.  
   
7. Conventional Apples  
Mark Kastel, former executive for agribusiness and codirector of the [Cornucopia Institute](http://www.cornucopia.org/), a farm-policy research group that supports organic foods, gives us the scoop:  
**The problem:**  
If fall fruits held a ""most doused in pesticides contest,"" apples would win. Why? They are individually grafted (descended from a single tree) so that each variety maintains its distinctive flavor. As such, apples don't develop resistance to pests and are sprayed frequently. The industry maintains that these residues are not harmful.  
   
But Kastel counters that it's just common sense to minimize exposure by avoiding the most doused produce, like apples.  
""Farm workers have higher rates of many cancers,"" he says.  
And increasing numbers of studies are starting to link a higher body burden of pesticides (from all sources) with Parkinson's disease.  
**The solution:**  
Buy organic apples.  
**Budget tip:**  
If you can't afford organic, be sure to wash and peel them. But Kastel personally refuses to compromise.  
""I would rather see the trade-off being that I don't buy that expensive electronic gadget,"" he says. ""Just a few of these decisions will accommodate an organic diet for a family.""",conspiracy,Soy

Technically: comments which are ""flagged"" are sent for ""review"", where they remain in limbo forever.  In practical effect: comments are deleted \[from users' view or response\], then the text is funnelled to a learning algorithm pool, where they are processed -- serving to ""teach"" the 1's and 0's to better shape the text-based narrative.

What thus ultimately results in, is a system whereby the ""A.I."" increasingly controls the direction and flow of conversations, through the agency of its filtering-out of words and syntax it has been coded to not ""like.  Thereby, shaping whatever narrative is taking place.

Now, before the lay plebes' Pavlovian ""N-word"" reflex is predictably triggered, the words (and syntax) being deleted are not limited to so-called ""racial slurs"" and/or profanity -- it the word K.G.B. polices all possible conceivable discourse, ignoring context or appertaining video content.

The following is a far from exhaustive list of just some non-obvious (*i.e.*, not including the myriad schoolyard tier curse words or ""racial epithets"" that are rather predictably and summarily removed) examples of terms that elicit in the YouTube <25-second comment deletion protocol:

**""goyim""** (Yiddish for ""cattle"" / gentiles *(mildly offensive)* \-- officially banned since c.2018)

**""chimp""** (as in, chimpanzee/s -- our primate cousin/s)

""🐵"" (yes -- the literal monkey emoji 🥴)

**""negro""** (as well as the homonym, ""knee grow""... and even if the term itself is [liberally used in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA4fSFn5W8E) being commented on 🙄)

**""German bombing""** (🤔)

**""Jewish bankers"", ""Jewish merchant/s"", ""Jew"", ""Jewish 1%""** (context and/or video dependent)

**""50% / 13%""** (😏)

**""autism"", ""retarded""** (in most contexts)

**""Mongolian"", ""Manchurian""** (if used 'around' the word ""China"" or ""Chinese"" ⚠️)

**""JewTube"" / ""JudeTube""** (oddly, however, the more grammatically accurate portmanteau of ""Jude**n**Tube"" {""JewishTube""} sticks 😅)

**""((()))""** (enclosing a word or term with three parenthesis -- in vernacular, signifying something ""Jewish"" or related to Jews; a symbol used in YouTube's own logo)

**""dumb, stupid animals""** (as in the Heinz Kissinger's infamous quote, *""Military men are dumb, stupid animals...""*)

**""gay"" / ""queer""** (irrespective of context ♿)

**""Amerimutt""** (🤣)...

&#x200B;

There are innumerable more terms and syntax, many far more benign and less ambiguous (*i.e.*, interpretable as a slur or the like) than those listed.  In fact, the problem is not that a given term can be loosely misinterpreted as ""untoward""; rather, in the way in which the narrative becomes moulded by the the deletion process -- exacerbated by the information comments provide for the learning algorithm, which conspires to fashion a system which is ingravescently Orwellian in its effective functionality.  It's not like it's becoming more refined, and filtering only obvious provocation or threats, in order to shore up the ""safe space"" tomb for Generation Soy Lecithin to cower in and wish for death -- it's actually, in application, becoming *more* **Draconian and narrative-controlling**.

Try it for yourself, then post some of the terms that trigger this Stasi speech police:

1. Post a comment
2. Refresh the comment after \~25 seconds, by clicking the ""Newest first"" tab
3. See if your comment remains
4. If it's gone, check the terms used for any obvious, ""suspect"" terms -> remove them and re-post
5. If it's flagged again, remove entire sentences or paragraphs (depending on comment length) -> re-post -> refresh -> then add back sections of the comment -- each time observing for what triggers the deletion.

Some additional points to note:

* The comments triggered will be removed **within 25 seconds**.
* Comments can, however, be **deleted** ***after*** **the aforementioned 25-second time limit** (retroactively); which can be denoted by comment notifications to one's inbox, which lead to no comment thread, or any context for the user/s response.
* **The algorithm can be ""tricked""** by using alternate characters of a similar look -- Examples: using a ""9"" in place of a ""g"" (even letters from differing languages); spaces or hyphens between letters of a word; typing words backwards.
* **The system is continually adapting**, and what works (to allow a term to stick) one day, may not work later -- as a direct offshoot of our involuntary ""training"" of YouTube's proprietary computer code, to recognise more and more of our patterns of communication.
* **The censorship seems to vary between videos and/or uploader/user account**.  This may be as a result of the algorithm having its limits (in terms of the sheer volume of videos uploaded and comments made); a manually instituted system of targeting, for example, news and current affairs related content; or, even the content uploaders' themselves deleting /pruning comments... Among other variables.
* **The censorship spans all languages, and is not exclusive to English** \-- example: **""cigány""** \-- the Hungarian / Magar word for **""gypsy""** \-- gets deleted -- instantly! 
* **Google (the owner of YouTube) seems to be filter \[out\] searches relating to the censorship in question --** with most searches terms to said effect, throwing up only YouTube video links; as well as discussion topics at Google related fora (which are usually left open indefinitely), closed soon after being created / receiving a few responses.

>Included in the ‘witnesses’ for biotech was Professor Nina Fedoroff of Penn State University. (She is among the self proclaimed “experts” in the biotech field, like [Kevin Folta](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/12/deafening-silence-from-bill-nye-to-kevin-folta-gmo-debate-challenge/) and Jon Entine.) 

>Federoff cited [one of Biotech’s favorite articles](http://www.agbioworld.org/newsletter_wm/index.php?caseid=archive&newsid=2815) published by a German agricultural economist to support her claims that GMOs have increased crop yields “by 20 percent.”

>To give GM crops a fair swing – let’s see if they really have increased crop yields as biotech’s mouthpieces claim.

>GM corn is arguably one of the most widely planted crops in the US. More than 80% of ALL corn crops now planted are thought to be genetically modified. 

>Set aside the fact that this crop is grown mostly for animal feed and to take advantage of ethanol biofuel subsidies, not feed people, and companies like Monsanto, Dow and Syngenta still shouldn’t be able to claim GM crops have resulted in higher yields with a straight face.

>[A major new paper](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14735903.2013.806408) found that average yields of GE corn in the United States from 1986 to 2011 were slightly lower than corn yields over the same period in western Europe, where GE crops were not grown. 

>This study was not done by some no-name idiot either. The research was led by Jack Heinemann, a professor of genetics at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

>As I’ve pointed out before, Big Ag has their main influence in the US, and this also just happens to be one of the nations most responsible for wasting more than 50% of all the food we grow – so if Big Ag was really feeding more people, why are there still food banks all over the US feeding people who are still going hungry? 

>According to Big Ag and Biotech claims, we should have more than enough food with their latest technologies to feed everyone!

>Nonetheless, Heinemann’s paper describes how there is no significant difference between the yields of GE corn and soy grown in the United States and the non-GE varieties in western Europe.

>When you consider that GE corn and GE soybeans account for about 80 percent of the land area devoted to genetically modified crops the world over – that’s a pretty big statement. If your best crops are producing more yield, then surely your lesser known (papaya, eucalyptus, etc.) aren’t producing higher yields.

>How exactly does Fedoroff and her biotech buddies get off claiming that GM is increasing yields? Can they compete with the farmer in California [who is getting crazy yields using all organic practices,](http://naturalsociety.com/sustainability-on-steroids-organic-farmer-grosses-100k-an-acre/) and in the process restoring the health of the soil in an area that is suffering from a drought? 

>What about [high-performance agriculture that increases yields up to 8 times](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/09/22/high-performance-agriculture.aspx) without the use of biotech herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers? 

>What about the [Amish farmers that are bringing dead-soil back to life](http://www.bio.unipd.it/agroecology/download/pdf/papers/1989/91_In%20Search%20of.pdf) after biotech pesticide and herbicide damage by utilizing entirely organic methods, and enjoying record yields in the process?

>[Heinemann has thoroughly debunked](http://rightbiotech.tumblr.com/post/103665842150/correlation-is-not-causation) the work that Professor Federoff loves to quote from. 

>Heinemann explains that the data presented by the biotech industry to support their claims is not an accurate representation of the majority of GM crops currently being grown. 

>Biotech used data on GE cotton grown in India, which in the beginning did contribute to higher yields, but since has died down, and in the process completely damages the soil and biosphere, not the heavily grown Round Up Ready soy and corn that is planted all across America. 

>There is a reason they ignored this acreage – it doesn’t fit their GM promoting propaganda.

>It has also been pointed out that this particular German study didn’t account for farm management changes which could have changed crop yields, many of which had nothing to do with planting GE seed. For instance, did they use more fertilizer? Was there more irrigation?

>Furthermore,[ researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute found](http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01170.pdf) that the *“true yield increases for GE cotton in India were much smaller than the sponsoring seed companies claimed.”*

>What GMOs *have* done is to increase the use of glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide, increase the use of neonicotinoid insecticides, decimate bee and butterfly populations, started up an entire knew rash of super weeds across our fields, and caused untold damage to biodiversity and human health – so even if GM crops did increase yields – who cares?

My takeaways:

The locations seem to be fairly random, but there may be a large concentration on the west coast of the US. My next step is to map the locations and try to find a pattern.

The incidence rate based on these articles definitely appears to be increasing. From March to December 2021 there were an average of 2.7 “incidents” per month. For January to April 2022 there have already been 7.75 “incidents” per month, a major increase. 

The conspiracy: 

Food plants and food-related companies are seeing their livelihoods go up in smoke at an increasing rate. I think there is some nefarious force behind a lot (not all) of these fires, explosions, and chemical spills beginning earlier this year and stretching into the future as far as necessary to ensure food shortages and major price increases. This will be an attempt to squeeze the lower class out of the picture by making them spend all their money on food, essentially making them broke since they can’t afford housing, medical needs, vehicles, etc. on top of rising food costs. This will also be used by the government as justification for more spending, and they’ll start throwing money at large food corporations, allowing them to buy up all the world’s food production and processing (even more so than what they already own).",conspiracy,Soy

The downward spiral of YouTube can be traced directly to it’s acquisition by Google on October 9th, 2006. Slow and steady, the site has been converted to a weapon of propaganda.

It’s no secret that YouTube suppresses content that isn’t fully monetized. Saying a single bad word will cause your channel to be hit with a strike, affecting all future viewership opportunity. Speaking on a controversial subject matter will remove you from the public eye. You must be a slave to the robot overlords.

&#x200B;

YouTube is trying to force you into a box where every action you take is connected to a sponsor, therefore you must adhere to it’s forever-changing standards. They want you to be passive consumers of content. This is why the corpos are pushing regular creators off the platform and replacing them with late night talk show hosts that have deals with Pepsi and billions of dollars to run ads against us.

The moment your video receives a strike you can check your analytics and see there’s less video impressions than before. Impressions are your potential views, like showing up in a recommended feed. Even with 21,000+ subscribers, certain videos of mine receive less than 1,000 impressions due to the subject matter that is extracted automatically by artificial intelligence.

The best way to bypass this used to be vague titles to throw off the bots, then providing more context when promoting through third-party websites such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Now we have undeniable proof that all these websites are collaborating on silencing rebellious voices, most important is silencing those capable of penetrating the hive mind consciousness and bringing people back into the Real World.

The literal definition of Thought Crime. I have been banned from participating in unrelated communities due to my beliefs. But it’s OK: as long as I apologize I can be reinstated… how about you go duck yourself [🦆](https://emojipedia.org/duck/). Imagine how many losers actually gave into the peer pressure. Imagine how many men destroyed their families by going along with the system instead of protecting his tribe. What a LOSER.

All of these tags are 100% relevant to the memes I was posting, sh0eonhead and Alex Jones and Joe Rogan were in my meme including weeb shit at the end, that rules out the argument for irrelevant tags. There is zero evidence of violence in the video or extremist groups.

**Within 1 month I was censored across 5 different platforms.** Coincidence? The truth is, I’m rising up the charts and gaining traction in the devils list of rebel forces. My name first showed up when Susan demonetized me in 2020, which is the same time that the World Economic Forum accelerated the depopulation agenda. The more of a threat I am to the false narrative, the more they retaliate with dirty tricks.

Never forget: there’s a folder out there with a transcript of every single word you’ve ever spoken in the presence of a device. A catalogue of every time you stepped in front of a security camera. A prediction of what you’re most likely going to do next based on your past data. Who has access to this? Who is watching me right now as I write this?

Don’t forget one of the principle lessons of 1984: they were tracking Winston and Julia’s activities for almost a decade before they were officially caught. This is how O’brien knew to torture Winston with rats: in a one-time comment he told Julia “I hate rats”. They were in their secret hideout that they didn’t know was bugged… why didn’t Big Brother stop their rebellion early on?

It’s the same concept with villains like Darth Vader allowing Luke to land on Endor instead of pre-emptively destroying him in space. Vader wants to see how far you are willing to resist. This is why submission = death; they get bored far too quickly. Your disobedience makes them curious.

Susan Wojcicki, renowned technocrat and CEO of YouTube claims free speech is a core value of their platform. What she really means is that they don’t give a shit about free speech. The modern witch uses inversion; one of the oldest tricks in the book, like the upside-down cross.

Corpos have spent trillions of dollars integrating the World Wide Web with the Real World infrastructure. Meta is on the same conquest: their primary objective is making it **more difficult** to live without their technology, to make it a time consuming pain in the ass to unplug from the Matrix.

This way you don’t have a choice. If you want to function in modern society, you have to download the apps. You can’t even use the newest VR headset without having a ~~Facebook~~ Meta account.

It's not enough to restrict how you navigate the internet; their primary objective is controlling how people behave, manipulating how your brain operates. Now imagine someone having the power to dictate what you’re allowed to see. You’re now a blank canvas for the propogandists to experiment on.

**DOCUMENTS & PROOF: PAGE 30** in the Melbourne Experiment Report, it has been confirmed that the internet has been re-conceptualized as a human behavior laboratory at global scale. This document released after the plandemic of 2020:

Google collaborates with fact-checkers to inseminate false information to the front pages of common search terms. Unbiased research requires an unbiased search engine: my favorite time-now is Yandex. It is a Russian based site compatible with auto-translate to English. It has it’s flaws, such as a limited capability to filter through ‘most-recent’ news, but at least it’s results haven’t been scrubbed by Big Tech.

Many are shocked when I tell them DuckDuckGo has been compromised. Here is an open admission by Gabriel Weinberg, **CEO of DuckDuckGo:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ynhcilcgcos91.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0942e8740db20252410ec2ad2c5fe16d5a464bfe

We can agree that Putin is a war criminal. We can agree that Biden touches little kids. We can agree that Zelenskyy is a silver spoon actor who finally landed a lead role as Ukraine President. We can all agree that every politician is 99% most likely a satanic p e d o file that visits Bohemian Grove once a year. We can all agree that Epstein was butt buddies with every celebrity you know. Just another suspicion thrown into the Memory Hole.

QR Codes were weaponized during the Covid Lockdowns. Fear porn successfully made the libtards afraid of everything with germs on it. It’s going to be a rough day when they find out how much bacteria is crawling around on their reusable face masks.

The last apartment complex we lived in had a laundry room that only accepted payments through their app. **To wash clothes you’re required to have a smart phone capable of downloading apps**, data to connect to the app because free WiFi isn’t global, you have to turn on location services, create an account, transfer money from your bank to the app, use a QR scanner to activate the washer or dryer, and THEN you can wash your clothes. Not even Orwell could’ve came up with a system this degrading.

Monster Jam doesn’t allow you to use the parking lot without first downloading the parking app. Men in masks stand in the area scanning your QR code as you drive by. You’re not allowed to pay for parking with cash due to covid. When we see the sheep enforcing this system, we should all point and laugh. Some good old fashioned humiliation never hurt anyone; if anything it causes deeper self-reflection. Either you become more convicted in your beliefs or your begin to question everything; both of these are productive pathways for the future.

&#x200B;

A little bit of context: I live in Arizona, one of the best states to live in terms of common sense. I haven’t worn a mask in over a year and only see 1% of sheep wearing them. To be honest, my heart goes out to them and I wish they could look me in the eyes and break out of their propaganda-induced trance. Vaccination numbers are just about the same as everywhere else. You may be able to keep common sense alive in the real world, but most people fall victim to what the screens tell them.

If you didn’t have internet, would you have even known there was a ‘pandemic’? Probably not. You would be like me and my comrades laughing at the losers afraid to go outside without a body condom on, but at the same time we laugh, we pray they break free.

This is why I will always speak my mind and FIGHT for my beliefs. Big Tech wants you to be a weakling beta soy-boy incapable of defending yourself or your loved ones. FUCK THAT.

We need to return to a decentralized internet, where the majority of people would congregate in underground forums, where self expression wasn’t considered a crime against humanity, where p e d o files weren’t given more benefits than normal citizens, where robot overlords didn’t dictate if you were a good boy or not.

We hold all the power required to tell these corpo scum to fuck off out of our lives. The more you silence us, the more vindication we receive.

UNLIMITED POWER to overthrow the tyrants.

""...Despite their tireless lobbying efforts in Brussels, *the “Big Six” (Monsanto, Du Pont Pioneer, Syngenta, Vilmorin, Winfield and KWS)* continue to hit a brick wall of resistance in many of Europe’s biggest markets, including Germany and France. 

...However, Monsanto’s bullying tactics failed to impress the Mexican judges. On August 15, the court convened to review Zaleta’s alleged bias ruled against the U.S. corporation’s legal suit. Also spurned by the Mexican courts was the *world’s third largest GMO seed manufacturer, Syngenta*, whose reapplication for a license to run test trials of its maize crops was rejected this week by the Federal Court.

...as award-winning professor of Cellular Neurobiology David R. Schubert warned in a 2013 letter to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto:

Introducing GM corn into Mexico would pose a huge environmental risk given that the plant is native to the country. The GM varieties would drastically diminish the crop diversity of both Mexico and the world at large.

GM corn would make the crop production process a lot more expensive. Buying the same crop seeds year after year – as already happens in the U.S. and across many agricultural sectors in the global south (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and India) – would increase the costs throughout the Mexican food chain, putting millions of smallholders out of business.

GMO corn will also increase Mexico’s social and political dependence on oligopolies. Once transnational corporations dominate the seed market of a particular crop (as has happened with Soy and is fast happening with Corn), they will continue introducing GM seeds for other crops and increasing their power over Mexico’s agricultural sector. 

As Schubert warned, this has already happened in the United States, “where seed companies are one of the main sources of financial funding for the two main political parties and have put their own people in senior positions of power to dictate national and international agricultural policy”.

GM maize expressing Bt protein and herbicide resistance and the chemicals required for their cultivation pose a serious health hazard to those who consume it – especially on the scale at which it is consumed in Mexico.

Most importantly, **once the GM seeds are planted, they’ll be no going back.** The country’s native varieties, which are the result of thousands of years of careful selection and breeding, will be irreversibly contaminated – even if the GM seeds are introduced on a modest scale.""

2. Greys arrive. They like cow lips, experiments and butt stuff. Apart from that their attitude to us is pretty much the same attitude as humans have towards ants. The Chinese have already built ghost cities for them to live in so they are exempt from butt stuff and experiments.

3. Reptilians. They like human flesh and adrenochrome. So you either get a designation as food or drugs (they have their own version of the FDA).

60,"The food available in stores containing some type of soy or other legume product full of contaminated toxins, making the lectin producing bacteria/microorganisms in our soil/gut also resistant and thus also causing resistance against medications and even certain food products…full explanation below!",42.0,r4koov,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/r4koov/the_food_available_in_stores_containing_some_type/,11.0,1638151661.0,"
If Lactose intolerance causes problems digesting lactose (dairy/breast milk sugar…) and diabetes causes problems with glucose (blood sugar)…why is lactose marketed as an allergy and not a type of diabetes?
They both deal with sugar resistant problems

If you dig a little deeper you will come across lectins…

“Lectins are defined as proteins that bind to carbohydrates. The same features that lectins use to defend plants in nature may cause problems during human digestion. They resist being broken down in the gut and are stable in acidic environments, features that protect lectin-containing plants in nature.”

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/lectins/

Now take into consideration all the pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, fertilizers,etc. 
humans treat the ground with. 

I also recently learned that the seeds are also pre-coated with certain chemicals before ever being seeded, bc a certain chemical used in a particular area (Germany) was killing all the bees in the thousands almost immediately after spraying it for the first time 🐝  

Source of  above claims and also interesting documentary:
https://youtu.be/UavrCMXP2H0

I must also mention how lectin is an “anti-nutrient” which means it won’t allow the gut to absorb any nutrients out of the food, which in certain cases may be needed, but the opposite is currently true…

For example cereal, nutrient bars, or protein shakes all have extra vitamins and minerals added…

They may still contain some level of lectins, and combined with other lectins found in other food you may eat throughout the day, it adds up quickly in the gut, causing the nutrients to not properly absorb, and thus your body tries making up for it by absorbing all the sugars and salts it’s also exposed to in high amount in the food…(bc it’s easier?)

This causes humans to get sick and suffer from health issues, on top of, the microbiome full of microorganisms being severely out of wack in the majority of Americans…

Since these lectins are the Plant’s Natural defenses and they bind to carbohydrates…and these man-made toxins are being sprayed and designed to “mimic” these naturally occurring chemicals, could it be that all the legumes, including soy, nuts, and other plants that are being poisoned, absorbing and replacing their natural lectin (and even other proteins produced by the bacteria in the soil…) with the toxic chemical mixture in the soil they are absorbing as nutrients to grow and build themselves?

So, we are poisoning all the little bacteria that help produce these lectin proteins that bind to the plants roots to keep it healthy, protected, and growing. 

We as humans are SEVERELY affecting and damaging the soil microorganisms, whose job it is to produce healthy food for us to survive….

As a result, the plants or food becomes heavily contaminated with the man-made toxins down to its cellular structure, which begins to change its “rna/dna makeup”…

As the chain continues, the animals, the humans consume get pumped full of synthetically, man-made hormones, on top of, them eating the contaminated sick plants, who are full of toxins (also), bc the humans are attempting to kill off all the bacteria, fungus, and other microorganisms that are the FUNDAMENTAL FIRST BUILDING BLOCK OF LIFE!!!!!

Without the soul microorganisms, humans will die eventually, and we are purposely trying to kill them????!!!!!!! 

How Will Humans Die or be affected If they Continue poisoning the soil/water????

	•	Humans are actively trying to kill insects and other “pests” off, causing a chain reaction, which is also killing off and making microorganisms sick, that help the plants grow.

	•	Plants consume and absorb the sick and highly toxic bacterias and other microorganisms “waste” or “poop”   (which is the nutrition for the plants, that it uses to produce vitamins and minerals with).

	•	The plants are now sick and contaminated with these man-made chemicals internally (root/cellular level) and externally

	•	Life Stock humans consume contain man-made hormones, and on top of that,      life stock eats the contaminated grains and plants.

	•	Humans consume many plant products, all who absorb these chemicals for nutrients. Then the humans eat the same chemicals they are spraying on the plants, for nutrients.                                                  The MAJORITY OF FOOD CONTAINS SOY!!! SOY is treated with chemicals, you can even make oil out of it….crazy…yum, yum…

	•	If these man-made pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, fertilizers,etc. humans treat the ground with is killing and making the microorganisms in the soil very sick….                                           Wouldn’t it also be doing the same to the human Microbiome in the gut? Which is responsible for keeping the human, as a whole organism, alive and healthy??

Diabetes, heart disease, certain “allergies” or resistance,  lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, obesity, and other major health problem related to the food, not only has to do with the extreme sugar and salt contents added by companies into the food, but also the main issue affecting Americans, the soil, which is silently poisoning EVERYTHING and ironically down the food chain line also humans… 

The higher on the food chain something is the more of these “toxins” you would be consuming, according to what you learn in science class…

A delicate balance, I say, humans must never forget about the little unseen aspects of life just because they seem like they are less important, due to them being “unseen” by eye or “I”...

If humans could shrink down onto their level, it would be a whole new dimension and would look big and suddenly become important…funny how things work. 

They are just trying to help us, but we are attacking them like in war…and as an end result the whole nation suffers… 

Since humans are also dependent on the microorganism nation, bc well they live in the gut and help them absorb nutrients properly, the interconnected systems should take care of each other, not only in the gut, but also the soil…

Just notice as your walking in the grocery store…almost everything contains some type of soy. 

It was bothering me so bad initially, bc I shop for people and noticed during the last couple of years there has been a high increase in soy milk/almond milk/ soy burger/cereal contains soy and if not soy, wheat. 

And soy contains lectins, most which get removed through the heating process yes, but now imagine ALL the different food currently available in stores containing some type of soy or other legume product full of contaminated lectin making the bacteria in our gut resistant and thus also causing resistant against medications and even certain food products. 

Other items that contribute heavily to the current health problems humans are experiencing, includes the high amounts of sodium and high amounts of sugar in all the processed produce. Also the carcinogenic artificial colors and additives, including Blue1 , yellow 5, red 40 and many others…

There’s even Basic Black 1 dye/ink found in some water sources due to water contamination from companies. 

It’s not your fault.
It needs to change.
The food industry is one of the biggest “conspiracies.”
They are lying to to the people.
 They are making us sick and resistant and above is how it’s happening…

In that when a freshman enters college, he or she gains 15 pounds their first semester and this is usually chalked up to ""eating your feelings"" or being off mommy and daddy's leash or smoking week and getting the endless munchies or having so much sex you need the extra hay to pack into the old oat mask or some final form of puberty etc. But, I have another theory.  I formulated this theory a few years ago, when I, my very own self went to college and ate at the chow hall. 

I noticed when I would eat at the college cafeteria, no matter how much I ate, I could never get full. I would eat pizza and brisket and terrible chinese food and hamburgers and hotdogs and french fries and desert (not all at the same time, but sometimes yes). At first I chalked up my endless appetite to stress or some sort of social anxiety complex, you know, like when a rodent, a rabbit specifically, lives its life in eternal fear and just stuffs its fucking face with grass and leaves and carrots endlessly. A sort of prey mindset. 

However, as the days and years rolled on, I would ask my friends and other people I would meet if they felt the same way. And most of them agreed, or they were very unaware people who didn't think much, or they were women and they just pretended to eat. 

One day I noticed that there were allergy labels in front of all the food. Some of them said nuts, and dairy or shellfish(rare occasions), but their was one allergen that they all had in common, SOY . So, I became aware of the SOY.

It was everywhere. It was in the icecream, they fried the french fries in soy oil, all the dressings were made with soy oil, the mockery of chinese food was cooked in soy oil. So I asked one of the guys who worked there about it, and he said they cut all the food with it. They cut the hamburgers with soy protein, everything that was fried was fried in soy oil, they even added it to mash potatoes and grits and vegetable medleys. They would take a perfectly cooked piece of brisket and set it in a bath of soy oil. All the deserts were cut with soy protein powder. . . .you'd see a beautiful piece of chocolate cake or a chocolate chip cookie and you'd hit with your fork and it was like playdough, and it tasted like a fucking protein bar. It was disgusting. 

So my theory is this. Soy is an appetite expander or the opposite of an appetite suppressant. So, when ever you ate at the college cafeteria, you could not get full, no matter hard you tried. This leads to over eating and what is colloquially known as the ""freshman 15."" At the same time, I had a suspicion, sort of a joke, but now I wonder? if they were ""Washing the food."" By ""washing the food,"" I mean, were they sucking the vitamins out of the food and selling the nutrients to vitamin companies and then cutting all the food with soy protein, like it was cheap cocaine? I mean, none of the food was right. Even the salads and lettuce and olives and stuff was lifeless and limp and tasteless, everything looked like it was made out of plastic and the more you ate, the more hungry and unwell you felt. And I was not the only one to feel this way, many other people I knew shared this sentiment.  

It was a sketchy chow hall on top of all this already sketchy stuff. The manager of the whole thing was caught stealing money from students accounts and putting it directly into crypto or something like that, it was a whole scandal. They had some policy about keeping all the money on your student card you didn't use and not letting it roll over into the next semester, it always seemed really fucked up to me.

ONE: Scientific American, June 23, 2009, [“Weed-whacking herbicide proves deadly to human cells,”](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weed-whacking-herbicide-p/) by Crystal Gammon:

“Glyphosate, Roundup’s active ingredient, is the most widely used herbicide in the United States. About 100 million pounds are applied to U.S. farms and lawns every year, according to the EPA.

“Until now, most health studies have focused on the safety of glyphosate, rather than the mixture of ingredients found in Roundup. But in the new study, scientists found that Roundup’s inert ingredients amplified the toxic effect on human cells—even at concentrations much more diluted than those used on farms and lawns.

“One specific inert ingredient, polyethoxylated tallowamine, or POEA, was more deadly to human embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells than the herbicide itself – a finding the researchers call ‘astonishing.’

“‘This clearly confirms that the [inert ingredients] in Roundup formulations are not inert,’ wrote the study authors from France’s University of Caen. ‘Moreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death [at the] residual levels’ found on Roundup-treated crops, such as soybeans, alfalfa and corn, or lawns and gardens.”

TWO: Reuters, 4/25/13, [“Heavy use of herbicide Roundup linked to health dangers—US study,”](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/roundup-health-study-idUSL2N0DC22F20130425) by Corey Gillam:

“Heavy use of the world’s most popular herbicide, Roundup, could be linked to a range of health problems and diseases, including Parkinson’s, infertility and cancers, according to a new study.

“The peer-reviewed report, published last week in the scientific journal Entropy, said evidence indicates that residues of ‘glyphosate,’ the chief ingredient in Roundup weed killer, which is sprayed over millions of acres of crops, has been found in food.

“Roundup is now heavily sprayed in what is known as the ‘Soy Republic’, an area of Latin America larger than the state of California. This region has undergone a profound transformation since genetically modified (GM) crops were first introduced in 1996.

“Dr. Medardo Avila Vazquez, a pediatrician specializing in environmental health, explained his concerns:

“‘The change in how agriculture is produced has brought, frankly, a change in the profile of diseases. We’ve gone from a pretty healthy population to one with a high rate of cancer, birth defects, and illnesses seldom seen before. What we have complained about for years was confirmed and especially what doctors say about the sprayed towns and areas affected by industrial agriculture. Cancer cases are multiplying as never before in areas with massive use of pesticides.’

“Much the same was found in Chaco, Argentina’s poorest province. In 2012, two villages were compared, the heavily sprayed farming village of Avia Terai and the non-sprayed ranching village of Charadai. In the farming village, 31 percent of residents had a family member with cancer while only 3 percent of residents in the ranching village had one.”

“Last year, Friends of the Earth (FoE) and GM Freeze commissioned a study based on urine samples from volunteers in 18 countries across Europe. It found that on average 44 percent of samples contained glyphosate. 

“The proportion of positive samples varied between countries, with Malta, Germany,the UK and Poland having the most positive tests, and lower levels detected in Macedonia and Switzerland. All the volunteers who provided samples lived in cities, and none had handled or used glyphosate products in the run-up to the tests.”

“In Mississippi, 75 percent of air and rain sample contained levels of glyphosate that could have serious physiological consequences for humans.”

“Claire Robinson from GM Watch notes that earlier this year a group of Chinese food safety volunteers submitted a request to China’s Ministry of Agriculture to disclose the study that justified issuing the safety certificate for the import into China of Monsanto’s Roundup. Writing on the GM Watch website, she says:

“‘The Ministry replied that Roundup was registered in China in 1988 based on a toxicology test report issued by a testing company called Younger Laboratories in St Louis, Missouri. The test was an acute exposure toxicity test (such tests last a maximum of a few days), with Roundup being given to rats by mouth and applied to the skin of rabbits. It claimed to find no effect on the eyes or skin, and no allergy. The volunteers asked the Ministry to release the study, and the Ministry in turn asked Monsanto. Monsanto replied that the study constituted its own commercial secret, adding that the company had never disclosed the study anywhere in the world and did not agree to disclose it now. The volunteers are appealing against the decision.’”

>As long as Monsanto is permitted to produce GMO seeds that are engineered to be immune to Roundup, the tonnage of glyphosate loosed on the world population will continue to escalate.

>Properly thought of, glyphosate is a chemical-warfare agent.

American biotechnology has turned Argentina into the world’s third-largest soybean producer, but the chemicals powering the boom aren’t confined to soy and cotton and corn fields. They routinely contaminate homes and classrooms and drinking water.A growing chorus of doctors and scientists is warning that their uncontrolled use could be responsible for the increasing number of health problems turning up in hospitals across the South American nation.In the heart of Argentina’s soybean business, house-to-house surveys of 65,000 people in farming communities found cancer rates two to four times higher than the national average, as well as higher rates of hypothyroidism and chronic respiratory illnesses. Associated Press photographer Natacha Pisarenko spent months documenting the issue in farming communities across Argentina.

Most provinces in Argentina forbid spraying pesticides and other agrochemicals next to homes and schools, with bans ranging in distance from 50 meters to as much as several kilometers from populated areas. The Associated Press found many cases of soybeans planted only a few feet from homes and schools, and of chemicals mixed and loaded onto tractors inside residential neighborhoods. In the last 20 years, agrochemical spraying has increased eightfold in Argentina- from 9 million gallons in 1990 to 84 million gallons today. Glyphosate, the key ingredient in Monsanto’s Round Up products, is used roughly eight to ten times more per acre than in the United States. Yet Argentina doesn’t apply national standards for farm chemicals, leaving rule-making to the provinces and enforcement to the municipalities. The result is a hodgepodge of widely ignored regulations that leave people dangerously exposed.In this March 29, 2013, photo, former farmworker Fabian Tomasi, 47, shows the condition of his emaciated body as he stands inside his home in Basavilbaso, in Entre Rios province, Argentina. Tomasi’s job was to keep the crop dusters flying by quickly filling their tanks but he says he was never trained to handle pesticides. Now he is near death from polyneuropathy BASAVILBASO, Argentina (AP) — Argentine farmworker Fabian Tomasi was never trained to handle pesticides. His job was to keep the crop-dusters flying by filling their tanks as quickly as possible, although it often meant getting drenched in poison.Now, at 47, he’s a living skeleton, so weak he can hardly swallow or go to the bathroom on his own.Schoolteacher Andrea Druetta lives in Santa Fe Province, the heart of Argentina’s soy country, where agrochemical spraying is banned within 500 meters (550 yards) of populated areas. But soy is planted just 30 meters (33 yards) from her back door. Her boys were showered in chemicals recently while swimming in the backyard pool.After Sofia Gatica lost her newborn to kidney failure, she filed a complaint that led to Argentina’s first criminal convictions for illegal spraying. But last year’s verdict came too late for many of her 5,300 neighbors in Ituzaingo Annex. A government study there found alarming levels of agrochemical contamination in the soil and drinking water, and 80 percent of the children surveyed carried traces of pesticide in their blood.American biotechnology has turned Argentina into the world’s third-largest soybean producer, but the chemicals powering the boom aren’t confined to soy and cotton and corn fields.The Associated Press documented dozens of cases around the country where poisons are applied in ways unanticipated by regulatory science or specifically banned by existing law. The spray drifts into schools and homes and settles over water sources; farmworkers mix poisons with no protective gear; villagers store water in pesticide containers that should have been destroyed.Now doctors are warning that uncontrolled pesticide applications could be the cause of growing health problems among the 12 million people who live in the South American nation’s vast farm belt.

In Santa Fe, cancer rates are two times to four times higher than the national average. In Chaco, birth defects quadrupled in the decade after biotechnology dramatically expanded farming in Argentina.“The change in how agriculture is produced has brought, frankly, a change in the profile of diseases,” says Dr. Medardo Avila Vazquez, a pediatrician and neonatologist who co-founded Doctors of Fumigated Towns, part of a growing movement demanding enforcement of agricultural safety rules. “We’ve gone from a pretty healthy population to one with a high rate of cancer, birth defects, and illnesses seldom seen before.”A nation once known for its grass-fed beef has undergone a remarkable transformation since 1996, when the St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. promised that adopting its patented seeds and chemicals would increase crop yields and lower pesticide use. Today, Argentina’s entire soy crop and nearly all its corn and cotton are genetically modified, with soy cultivation alone tripling to 47 million acres (19 million hectares).

Agrochemical use did decline at first, then it bounced back, increasing ninefold from 9 million gallons (34 million liters) in 1990 to more than 84 million gallons (317 million liters) today as farmers squeezed in more harvests and pests became resistant to the poisons. Overall, Argentine farmers apply an estimated 4.3 pounds of agrochemical concentrate per acre, more than twice what U.S. farmers use, according to an AP analysis of government and pesticide industry data.In this April 16, 2013, photo, Felix San Roman walks on his property in Rawson, in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. San Roman says that when he complained about clouds of chemicals drifting into his yard, the sprayers beat him up, fracturing his spine and knocking out his teeth. “This is a small town where nobody confronts anyone, and the authorities look the other way,” San Roman said. “All I want is for them to follow the existing law, which says you can’t do this within 1,500 meters. Nobody follows this. How can you control it?” (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)Glyphosate, the key ingredient in Monsanto’s popular Roundup brand of pesticides, is one of the world’s most widely used weed killers. It has been determined to be safe, if applied properly, by many regulatory agencies, including those of the United States and European Union.

On May 1, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency even raised the allowable levels of glyphosate residues in food, concluding that based on studies presented by Monsanto, “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population or to infants and children from aggregate exposure.”Argentina’s 23 provinces take the lead in regulating farming, and rules vary.Spraying is banned within 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) of populated areas in some provinces and as little as 50 meters (55 yards) in others. About one-third of the provinces set no limits at all, and most lack detailed enforcement policies.A federal environmental law requires applicators of toxic chemicals to suspend or cancel activities that threaten public health, “even when the link has not been scientifically proven,” and “no matter the costs or consequences,” but it has never been applied to farming, the auditor general found last year.In response to soaring complaints, President Cristina Fernandez ordered a commission in 2009 to study the impact of agrochemical spraying on human health. Its initial report called for “systematic controls over concentrations of herbicides and their compounds … such as exhaustive laboratory and field studies involving formulations containing glyphosate as well as its interactions with other agrochemicals as they are actually used in our country.

”But the commission hasn’t met since 2010, the auditor general found.Government officials insist the problem is not a lack of research, but misinformation that plays on people’s emotions.“I’ve seen countless documents, surveys, videos, articles in the news and in universities, and really our citizens who read all this end up dizzy and confused,” Agriculture Secretary Lorenzo Basso said. “I think we have to publicize the commitment that Argentina has to being a food producer. Our model as an exporting nation has been called into question. We need to defend our model.”In a written statement, Monsanto spokesman Thomas Helscher said the company “does not condone the misuse of pesticides or the violation of any pesticide law, regulation, or court ruling.”“Monsanto takes the stewardship of products seriously and we communicate regularly with our customers regarding proper use of our products,” Helscher said.In this Sept. 24, 2013, photo, a tractor known as a “mosquito” dusts a field near Parana, in the Entre Rios province, Argentina.

But The Associated Press found many cases of soybeans planted only a few feet from homes and schools, and of chemicals mixed and loaded onto tractors inside residential neighborhoods. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)Argentina was among the earliest adopters of the new biotech farming model promoted by Monsanto and other U.S. agribusinesses.

Instead of turning the topsoil, spraying pesticides and then waiting until the poison dissipates before planting, farmers sow the seeds and spray afterward without harming crops genetically modified to tolerate specific chemicals.This “no-till” method takes so much less time and money that farmers can reap more harvests and expand into land not worth the trouble before.But pests develop resistance, even more so when the same chemicals are applied to genetically identical crops on a vast scale.So while glyphosate is one of the world’s safest herbicides, farmers now use it in higher concentrates and mix in much more toxic poisons, such as 2,4,D, which the U.S. military used in “Agent Orange” to defoliate jungles during the Vietnam War.In 2006, a division of Argentina’s agriculture ministry recommended adding caution labels urging that mixtures of glyphosate and more toxic chemicals be limited to “farm areas far from homes and population centers.” The recommendation was ignored, according to the federal audit.The government relies on industry research approved by the EPA, which said May 1 that “there is no indication that glyphosate is a neurotoxic chemical and there is no need for a developmental neurotoxicity study.”Molecular biologist Dr. Andres Carrasco at the University of Buenos Aires says the burden from the chemical cocktails is worrisome, but even glyphosate alone could spell trouble for human health. He found that injecting a very low dose of glyphosate into embryos can change levels of retinoic acid, causing the same sort of spinal defects in frogs and chickens that doctors increasingly are registering in communities where farm chemicals are ubiquitous.

This acid, a form of vitamin A, is fundamental for keeping cancers in check and triggering genetic expression, the process by which embryonic cells develop into organs and limbs.“If it’s possible to reproduce this in a laboratory, surely what is happening in the field is much worse,” Carrasco said. “And if it’s much worse, and we suspect that it is, what we have to do is put this under a magnifying glass.”His findings, published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology in 2010, were rebutted by Monsanto, which said the results “are not surprising given their methodology and unrealistic exposure scenarios.”Monsanto said in response to AP’s questions that chemical safety tests should only be done on live animals, and that injecting embryos is “less reliable and less relevant for human risk assessments.”Get Your Anonymous T-Shirt / Sweatshirt / Hoodie / Tanktop, Smartphone / Tablet Cover or Mug In Our Spreadshirt Shop!“Glyphosate is even less toxic than the repellent you put on your children’s skin,” said Pablo Vaquero, Monsanto’s corporate affairs director in Buenos Aires.

 “That said, there has to be a responsible and good use of these products because in no way would you put repellent in the mouths of children and no environmental applicator should spray fields with a tractor or a crop-duster without taking into account the environmental conditions and threats that stem from the use of the product.”Out in the fields, warnings are widely ignored.For three years, Tomasi was routinely exposed to chemicals as he pumped pesticides into the tanks of crop-dusters. Now he’s near death from polyneuropathy, a debilitating neurological disorder, which has left him wasted and shriveled.“I prepared millions of liters of poison without any kind of protection, no gloves, masks or special clothing,” he said. 

“I didn’t know anything. I only learned later what it did to me, after contacting scientists.”“The poison comes in liquid concentrates, in containers with lots of precautions to take when applying it,” Tomasi explained. “But nobody takes precautions.”With soybeans selling for about $500 a ton, growers plant where they can, often disregarding Monsanto’s guidelines and provincial law by spraying with no advance warning, and even in windy conditions.In Entre Rios, teachers reported that sprayers failed to respect 50-meter (55-yard) limits at 18 schools, dousing 11 during class.

The trailer even says things like we're in the year 2022, nothing moves? Is this a reference to the ""Green Agenda/Climate Change"". Like what does climate change mean in terms of they love giving us hints? Made in relation to when Klaus said, ""We need to prepare for a more angrier world""? He tells of how we will be happy but at the same time angrier, is this the climate change? So this is how people in soylent green are, in a world that doesn't move, and dependent on soylent green as nobody farms independently or isn't allowed to. 

Year after year soy products get pushed more and more, it gets labeled green, I know the agenda is to push us to eat less meat. In my opinion it might be a distraction to just push you onto the alternative. In my opinion the alternative is basically soylent green as depicted in the movie, or at weakest a form of it; the basis. I've seen alkaline hydrolysis/liquid cremation becoming more popular these days, as it too produces a lower ""carbon footprint"" as in carbon is life and you are the footprint. The liquid cremation is then transferred to waste water and the other half is made into fertilizer to spray on crops. Ever wonder why the ""impossible"" burger or the ""beyond"" beef burger are called these names but at the same time touted as green? Why do they care about the color as much as the flavor, call it green but make it look like it's bloody? There are even so called celebrity meat sites. 

[http://bitelabs.org/](http://bitelabs.org/)

Do we really think we're getting a big juicy bite out of some celebs flesh, or is it just us and we've caught on, in ways. They're doing anything to provide depopulation en masse. Bill Gates largest farmland owner wants to put MRNA tech into the food. Is human's liquidized and turned into fertilizer spray providing it? Into waterways, so water and food, basically every fabric you need to survive are providers of said tech. Will the fertilized crops provide the food to mosquitoes that will send another plague? Don't mosquitoes kill more than any other animal? Bill Gates foretold of it and still does, he wishes to produce a zero carbon footprint, and the general public is the footprint because it is carbon based life. He preaches of a blacked out sun, idk what that means, more manufactured climate change and famines? Famines produce cannibalistic ways, that can start as early as 7-14 days. Is famine the usher to zombie's in some way, where we ignore such a horrid way to live, just to survive; but we killed our former self to survive in this new world? Do they force us to these measure's because they hate the judgement of what they do themselves? Misery sure does love company. How could one survive in a state where you're force to eat thyself, I was under the assumption it would give you prior disease?

According to Grant County Sheriff's Office officials, the Wilbur Ellis fertilizer plant near Moses Lake, Washington, caught fire and mostly burned on Sunday afternoon, October 23, prompting authorities to issue a shelter order. on-site due to air quality issues, KING5 reported.

“Firefighters spent the night keeping an eye on hot spots that were still burning at the scene of the fire. Firefighters responded to the plant around 4pm on Sunday and found it fully engulfed in flames,” the report noted.

“Grant County Fire District #5 said fighting this fire required extra care. Firefighters limited water use so that the fertilizer would not contaminate underground ecosystems,” the report continued. “The crews were also working to ensure the flames did not jump into the elevator. If it caught fire and crashed, it could knock out nearby power lines.”

No one was inside the factory at the time of the fire, officials added. When firefighters arrived, they witnessed huge clouds of smoke pouring out of the building.

If this were the only fire at a food processing plant to have occurred this year or last, it wouldn't be news. But there have been dozens across the country, as well as a few in other countries recently, like the one in the world's biggest food market in Paris, France.

In early September, QC Poultry saw its Montebello, Calif., processing plant catch fire as well, adding to a wave of “accidental fires” at food facilities in recent months.

Suddenly, in the past year, facilities that produce, process or otherwise handle the food we all eat mysteriously caught fire. Many of them are now a huge pile of rubble as the flames consume their entire structures.

Here's a partial list of the ""food fires"" we've seen in the past year:

A meat processing plant in El Paso, Texas

A butter production plant in Caldwell, Idaho

A poultry processing plant in Ontario, Canada

A soy and biodiesel processing plant in Claypool, Indiana

Numerous chicken farms in Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and Iowa

“Dude we are really going to eat bugs,” wrote one Twitter user, seeing the writing on the wall with everything going on.

“Oddly, the insect factories are running smoothly,” added another.

“This is all climate change's fault,” joked another user, followed by a response about how all vaccine factories are also doing well and elegantly.

“I see a lot more ahead,” another user said of what the future holds for food production.

And remember, Sunday's fertilizer fire comes as the world experiences a global shortage of the commodity, which is threatening food production across the world. In fact, the vast majority of ammonia production in Europe, which is a key ingredient in fertilizer production, has been shut down due to the rising cost of natural gas.

Most of the continent's liquefied natural gas (LNG) came from Russia. But after the invasion of Ukraine, Western nations began to sanction Moscow, and that included an end to purchases of cheap energy. As such, LNG prices have skyrocketed on the European continent, making ammonia production very expensive.

“Ammonia prices, while volatile, were up 15 percent in Q3 and could rise further as record European gas prices reduce production and send ammonia producers to the global market in search of replacement supplies to operate update – with winter still coming,” Bloomberg Alexis Maxwell of Intelligence wrote in a note.",conspiracy,Soy

Pork isn't bad for you, but a factory hot dog is. Butter isn't bad for you, but margarine, and other unnatural oils that require huge machines to process it, is. Hell, even PIZZA isn't bad for you if you make it homemade with real flour, olive oil, tomatoes and cheese and don't buy it from a Pizza chain that use cheap oils, cheap cheese, and cheap dough.

So much around us in the commercial grocery world is poison. Even the meat, grains and produce have been modified, but those ingredients are still infinitely better than processed foods, and the more you stick with natural foods, the healthier you'll be.

Avoid most foods in a can or a box, most oils (avoid canola, sunflower, safflower, palm, and soy), processed meat and cheese, salty snacks, etc... because what they all have in common is that they are made with cheap, processed ingredients. That's it. That's all you have to avoid. If you stick with real food, with REAL, ""good fucking food"" and don't overeat, most people's bodies will heal.

I get it. A lot of people don't have money and eat ramen and corn dogs to survive. My advice is learn how to cook a little more. White rice is SUPER cheap and 1,000% better for you than ramen noodles, and there's all kinds of things you can do with it. I also bought chicken quarters at a local supermarket in Washington state last week for $1.29 a pound. Potatoes are cheap, too. Options are out there, you just have to look for them and go for the bargains.

- Soy is added in a lot of food . and has proven estrogen properties.
- Contraception pills in our water supply can change sex of the fish... im pretty sure they can and do influence male sexual development.
- Males are weaker , more femine in younger generations , with less muscle mass and feminised facial features ( strong , sleek jaw , not square or anything , think Angelina Jolie ...)
- Huge ammount of M to F transgenderism , and much much less F to M transgenderism.

96% of mammal life on earth is gone and has been displaced by humans and livestock

Humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinctions of earth

It takes 1 ton of coal to make just 6 solar panels that require natural gas back ups

After 30 years trying, renewable energy is just 4% of total global energy use

Emissions went up 50% in the same 30 years we promised renewable energy as the fix

By 2040, renewable energy will only be 15% of global energy demand

According to the Wall Street Journal, The International Energy Agency and British Petroleum Statistical

This is because only 20% of total global energy demand is used for electricity

If population and economic growth continued unabated, we would run out of food and water long before we reach 100% renewable global energy

The ecology of the world is breaking down from the molecular level up to the global biomass level

Ecological breakdown will beat renewable energy

Climate change will hyper accelerate collapse drivers

We refuse global UBI and birth control so we die for business

97,The push to veganism- lower our strength and make us more docile?,13.0,m1y55x,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m1y55x/the_push_to_veganism_lower_our_strength_and_make/,42.0,1615385021.0,"I was out walking the other evening after work, clearing my head from the brain pollution of daily life (social media, work stuff, benign conversations) and was going to my usual place of thinking broadly about the world and the situation we all find ourselves in. It was close to 0 degrees Celsius and I had seen my personal trainer that morning and I got thinking about how I am grateful to have worked out to keep myself limber and met my protein intake that day. This led me to thinking about veganism.

I got thinking about the big talking points about going vegan. The climate emergency alarmists push it, the animal welfare people push it, the NHS and other healthcare companies talk about reducing meat intake and there's a big globalist movement that condemns meat consumption including the UN, the EU and our elite one world overlords Bill Gates (who now owns thousands of acres of farmland which is important), and others including individual national governments.

Assuming that there are some elements of truth in some of these points - aka reducing meat consumption = less meat produced = less carbon released. I can see the logic there.

Less meat consumed = less saturated fats and cholesterol in some measure- I can see the logic there.

However to me what doesn't make sense is the push to these vegan alternatives. Let's take for example in the UK, most of the Quinoa is imported from South America (circa 4-5000 miles), and is grown in such vast quantities that the local population have less to eat as a result, let alone the fact that this negates the carbon emissions argument. How can a mouthful of (relatively) high protein grain flown from thousands of miles away be better for yourself and the environment than locally sourced foods that necessarily aren't vegan?

Secondly, if you look at meat alternatives like the Impossible Burger and other ultraprocessed vegan foods (not exactly a 'health food'), containing hormones and countless chemicals to make it look and taste like meat. I wonder firstly what's the point - would it not have been a better use of time to develop lab grown burgers using real animal cells (reducing emissions of rearing cattle while retaining a level of authenticity in terms of meat)? Secondly, why are they so quiet about the levels of oestogen and other chemicals in these vegan burgers? I ask what are the ulterior motives of encouraging us to eat these ultraprocessed foods laden with chemicals.

Thirdly, the natural levels of protein in meat contributes enormously to the maintenance of your musculoskeletal health, and let's not forget the levels of iron and vitamin B12 (the latter of which is found only in red meat), which are vital to health and specifically brain health and development. Very few vegan alternatives contain any sorts of these levels of vitamins and natural proteins, so again I ask why is there such a push?

&#x200B;

* Why is there such a push for us to eat ultraprocessed vegan alternatives when processed foods are already under fire for being bad for us?
* Why is it being kept quiet the amount of hormones and chemicals in vegan alternatives, and what else could be lurking inside not cited in the ingredients list?
* Flying quinoa and other grains thousands of miles to be consumed elsewhere surely negates the environmental impact of consuming locally reared animals for food?
* Bill Gates farmland ownership - is this an attempt to control the supply of food and move to synthetically produced food (with god knows what put in it)?
* The reduction of essential proteins and vitamin B12 specifically reduces brain and musculoskeletal health which can make us more docile and physically weaker and perhaps less resistant in the face of geopolitical adversity

I think with a lot of global movements (climate, inclusivity etc...) there is good intention that originally drive these movements which get hijacked (or maybe act as a mask) for nefarious purposes or in a way to attemp to control us or alter our behavior.

What do you think?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not attacking people's choice to be vegan/ vegetarian. I have no preference. I tend to eat a meat-light diet (predominantly plant based diet), but I am criticising here the many additives in things like meat replacement ""vegan"" and ""healthy"" alternatives like soy based protein replacements containing many hormones and chemicals.",conspiracy,Soy

100,On the front lines: my battle against forced infant formula for breastfed babies in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit,15.0,3sbdug,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3sbdug/on_the_front_lines_my_battle_against_forced/,7.0,1447186299.0,"I really was not sure whether to post this here or over at /r/breastfeeding. I think it's interesting, but I'm not sure if it will generate interest here. It might even be deemed inappropriate or irrelevant; if so, I will delete.

&nbsp;

My daughter was born a little over a week ago at 33 weeks gestation. She is perfectly healthy - just born early - and does not require respiratory support or heat - she only needs to master the suck/swallow/breath reflex and learn to eat without a feeding tube before she can go home.

&nbsp;

The hospital staff are very pro-breastfeeding and encourage all NICU moms to pump their milk to be fed to their babies. I'm a pretty militant breastfeeding mom myself, so I have been pumping every 2-3 hours round the clock, and my daughter gets the breastmilk through an NG tube while she attempts to latch/nurse. At first, I was not getting enough via pumping, so they were adding formula to each feed. But, my milk supply increased, and I was able to pump all the milk she needed and eliminate formula all together. Yay!

&nbsp;

Sounds good, right? Or so I thought... As soon as I was pumping enough and my daughter was getting 100% breastmilk, the doctor decided that my breastmilk needed to be ""fortified"" to add extra calories, vitamins, and minerals. The doctor said that, on average, breastmilk contains 20 calories per ounce and that preemies need extra calories. Preemies also require extra calcium/phosphorus/vitamin D for bone growth.  So, they add a powder called ""Neosure"" to the breastmilk to increase the calorie content to 22 calories per ounce and add extra minerals.

&nbsp;

That doesn't sound so bad until you look at the nutritional / ingredient info for NeoSure and realize that it is just formula. The fist four ingredients are nonfat milk, corn syrup solids, lactose, and soy oil. Gross! How in the world does anyone think it's a good idea to feed a baby corn syrup solids or soy oil???

&nbsp;

Additionally, the breastmilk that moms produce for premature babies ranges (in studies) from 14-36 calories per ounce. So, without testing the caloric content of my milk, how can we even know if we *need* to add calories? What if my milk is already 22 calories or greater? (There is a simple process to do this using a centrifuge, btw - it's called a creamatocrit - the hospital refused to perform this test, saying she would need the fortifier regardless).

So, I brought my concerns up to the doctor. I told her that I did not like the idea of feeding my preemie corn syrup or soy oil - those are things we avoid eating at home because of health concerns, so why would I voluntarily add them to my breastmilk? I also brought up calorie testing of my milk to make sure a supplement was even necessary. And, I asked if a plain calcium / phosphorus / vitamin D supplement without sugar or oil was available to add to my milk.

&nbsp;

This is where things got weird.

&nbsp;

The doctor seemed offended that I would bring her judgment / medical orders into question. She treated me like I was an ignoramus for even suggesting that this supplement migt not be a good idea. She insisted that all breastfed babies get this supplement, and if they did not give it to my daughter, she could have long term bone problems. She treated me like a bad mom for questioning her.

&nbsp;

OK....

&nbsp;

She told me that she would talk to the dietician for the NICU and ask if any alternatives are available. She proceeded to come into my room the next morning with one of her colleagues and the dietician, and they basically all ganged up on me, poo-pooed my concerns, told me that the practice is ""evidence based"" and ""safe"" and told me that the breastmilk ""fortifier"" (aka formula) is required. They said that they have never had a parent object to the ingredients and that. I am the only one.  I told them that I really did not want my baby fed corn syrup, but did not know of any alternatives without corn syrup. I basically conceded, and my daughter continues to get the fortifier added to her breastmilk.

&nbsp;

I have had a couple of medical professionals in the NICU talk to me on the down-low and suggest that this battle is not worth fighting. They warn me against pushing the issue, going so far as to suggest that if. I want to take my baby home at some point, I should drop the issue and just comply. Seriously? 

&nbsp;

Interestingly, in doing some reading about this breastmilk ""fortifier"" (aka formula), I have learned that it is pretty common for the doctors to send babies home with orders to continue the fortifier for the next 6months to 1 year of life. For a mom who breastfeeds, this means that she either has to pump her milk and add the fortifier powder, OR she has to feed at least 2 bottles of formula per day to provide the baby with the added calories/minerals.

&nbsp;

What a great way to ensure that moms who would otherwise be exclusively breastfeeding their babies are required to buy and feed formula to their newborn. Many moms simply give up breastfeeding because pumping & fortifying is such a hassle. What. Great way to ensure that every baby born in the NICU helps line the pockets of the formula companies. 

&nbsp;

This experience infuriates me. The lactation consultant will not get involved. She suggested I comply while I am at the hospital (as not to make waves) and then do what I want when i get home. She was very uncomfortable even talking about it.

nbsp;


TL/DR: The formula companies must have a great deal of influence over nutritional decisions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit because no one seems to want to oppose the pro-formula policies that exist here.

**THE GREAT RESET - TAKE 2**

The ""Great Reset"" will be a nightmare for individuals who are aware of our society. 

We are already living in this dystopian future.

We always think that we *will* be living in one, but fail to recognise that we ourselves are actually *in one right now*. 

If you were to bring people from the past into our time period, they would be horrified by what they are witnessing. 

To the people who don't see anything wrong in our society right now, they will enjoy the Great Reset.

&#x200B;

Predictions for the next 50 years:

1. UBI will be a thing. Powered by block-chain technology. Every single US born individual will have a unique address. This will vary from city to city. There will be a waiting list to live in other cities for those dependent on UBI. 

2. People will be entirely isolated from each other. One of the major forms of communication will be through video.

3. Information is going to get even harder to find. Reports that contradict from what's being pushed in the mainstream media will be suppressed.

4. People will not have ownership of most products - it will be subscriptions and rentals. 

5. We will not have trackers because everyone already carries a smartphone already. What they'll do is have some incentive chips that will lower our insurances, allow for more Government assistance, and access to rewards. It will keep track of our bodies - our visits to a health clinic will be nothing more than a ~~cattle~~, sorry car diagnostics check.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE GREAT RESET - TAKE 3**

According to billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, there are 150 people that run the world.

If the elite plutocrats who Chamath is referring to had their way...

The masses would have no property rights.

The masses would all be chipped and live in space efficient commie pods in the city.

The masses would have their procreation regulated.

The masses would have their food regulated - ideally a diet of bugs and soy, with less meat of course.

The masses would be treated as cattle.

Any effort by the WHO, WEF, W whatever organisation is geared towards this effort. 

That's all you really need to know.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

Of course, Take 3 seems too far fetched - it implies the world is run by a small group of psychopaths.

I'm sure Snopes has already debunked that ""conspiracy theory""...

WEF, WHO.

On the topic of W organisations - WWE.

What does this stand for?

Of course, World Wrestling Entertainment.

I'd like to highlight another W organisation in the entertainment industry.

WPE.

World Politics Entertainment.

Politics is just entertainment. 

Nothing more, nothing less.

Divide and Conquer.

A ruse.

Presidents are selected, not elected.

The last true President was JFK.

The end.

Oh, Merry Christmas...

Nearly every popular product today is promoted on television, in magazines, on billboards or on the internet by companies and corporations that pay millions of dollars for marketing ads. The people who own and run those lavishly rich companies and corporations make a fortune off customers in two ways. The first way, everyone understands, and that’s profit from product sales. The second way, hardly any Americans understand, including about 200 million people or so. That fortune is made off consumers getting sick from the products they’re sold, and we’re not just talking about food. So how do they accomplish that?

Cheap, toxic products sell very well in America, though they don’t make the sellers as much money as you might think. So then they invest in chronic sick care medicine and machinery because they know that after Americans buy all these cheap, toxic products and use them for years on end, they become chronically sick and run to the doctors and hospitals. Diagnostic equipment that’s used for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, strokes, autism and so on, those machines make companies billions and billions of dollars every year. Are you following the bouncing ball?

Pay attention to almost all major advertising campaigns you see on television for food, medicine or personal care products (including makeup, lotions, antiperspirants, toothpaste).

Even most baby food and infant formula is loaded with toxic oils and genetically modified corn and soy. Then you’ve got meat, dairy and baked goods. These products are utterly loaded with chemicals, toxins, bleach, ammonia, parabens, pathogens, fluoride, GMOs, heavy metals, synthetic dyes, artificial flavorings, petroleum-based ingredients and the list goes on.

Now they’re even advertising and marketing deadly vaccines using door-to-door sales forces who are armed to the teeth and equipped with vaccine kits.

Health insurance companies you see advertised on television invest in products that cause degenerative diseases

Even the CEOs and CFOs of healthcare companies invest in fast food chains, enterprises and stock because they know you will be dying young if you eat processed food regularly. Wherever you see expensive advertising and relentless marketing for products, expect that those products contain toxins to make you sick.

Most companies that sell clean food and truly natural products don’t make enough money to advertise like crazy all over television, social media, and in every newspaper across the country, daily.

Fact: US and Canadian health insurance giants own more than $2 billion in stock in McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, Burger King, Wendy’s, etc. So if you get your news and product information from websites or television stations that advertise fast food, prescription medications and personal care products, the odds are that news is fake, distorted, twisted and toxic to your health.

The same goes for vitamins and supplements that you find advertised where pharma advertises – they’re toxic.

Every dollar you spend matters either to your enjoyable longevity or pharma’s pockets and your own hastened, miserable demise

Every person and every person’s purchases matter in the grand scheme of things. Every dollar you spend matters. You must decide if you want to support the evil pharma companies and your own health demise, or organic companies that aren’t Big Food owned and that fuel your longevity.

Are you fostering your own medical enslavement by being lazy and buying what’s convenient, cheap and free? If you succumb to vaccinations, medications and chemotherapy, you are literally funding your own miserable, hastened demise.

Yes, America was built on advertising revenue, but that’s not all good. Hospitals are places you go to get worse, unless you simply have a deep cut or broken bone to mend, or some other trauma.

Otherwise, chronic sick care is planned and orchestrated in this country, hinged on 200 million Americans buying cheap, toxic products everywhere they see pharma advertising drugs. Just listen to the insane side effects and then imagine the people who market those products. They’re plain evil.

This is due to the phytoestrogens found naturally in soy beans which will increase the levels of estrogen in the body. But I never once thought about what effects it could have on a baby.

That was until I had my first kid. We had various samples of different formula that we got as gifts. We tried each one until we found one that he liked, which happened to be a soy based formula for babies with sensitive stomachs. Things were all good until we did some research on soy based formula, and it has changed my whole perspective on what we are feeding our babies at one of the most crucial times in their life.

For starters, I found a study from 2002 where scientists had two sets of twins. One of the twins had an exclusively cow based formula, while the other had exclusively soy based formula over the course of a month. The biggest take away for me was the plasma testosterone levels.  The cow based formula twin went from 3.1 ng/ml to 2.9 ng/ml over that time (6.66% drop), while the soy based formula twin went from 2.6 ng/ml down to 1.2 ng/ml (73.68%). 

Seeing this, we decided to drop the formula we were using and pick up a formula that doesn't have any soy in it.  One problem, there wasn't any. Every single product product available had some level of soy. We found ""cows milk based"" formula that had more dehydrated soy milk than cows milk (talk about misleading), or products that claimed to have no soy, but had additives that are extracted from soy beans through a chemical process (technically not wrong, but it would be like saying something is olive free but uses olive oil in the recipe). 

The only luck we had was goats milk based products or cows milk based formula from the UK, there simply wasn't a market in the US for these formulas with no soy at all.  This got me thinking though, all of these formulas have some level of soy in the mixture, which if the baby is getting exclusively formula, then they are going to be permanently effected.

There's many more data points that I could list out but I am already at 6 paragraphs so I will leave it with this, I believe that these soy based formulas are part of the machine that is driving down average testosterone levels in the western world, and it is also part of the reason woman seem to be maturing much earlier and faster than woman from 30+ years ago.  Adding soy to everything may found healthy, but it could be very well ruining our lives and in the decades to come we may look at soy completely different.",conspiracy,Soy

113,Here is your conventional agriculture (Big Ag) red pill and alternative methods. (aggregate of farming and gardening resources),10.0,k61e18,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k61e18/here_is_your_conventional_agriculture_big_ag_red/,4.0,1607015558.0,"I've gotten into a couple discussions about the inefficiencies of beef production and we don't have enough room to grow food for everyone. I'd like to bring forth and alternative view to conventional agriculture to show its not what we are farming, its how. Everything about farming is about the *management*. So here we go. [Oh here's a primer](https://youtu.be/LQRAfJyEsko), also a big list of resources below.


Animals are raised in [CAFO's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_animal_feeding_operation#:~:text=In%20animal%20husbandry%2C%20a%20concentrated,over%2045%20days%20a%20year.). This requires feed to be grown off site and processed and shipped in, sometimes from nearby, sometimes from across the country depending on location. In the instance of beef, they are usually feed grain (corn, soybeans, wheat) and silage products (corn, oats, hay). Cows are [ruminants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant) and are not really meant to eat grain, it makes them sick and raises the acidity of their rumen, slowing digestion. Cows are grazing animals and are meant to eat grass, the grass ferments in their rumen and they really actually feed on products of the bacteria that breaks down the grass. Pretty neat stuff. Sheep are the same way, as well as goats, deer... 

So lets get into the feed. Mostly grown in [Monoculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture) with bare soil, heavy [tillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage), and chemical applications. GMO grains mostly being corn and soybeans and other [additives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_mixed_ration) to round out their diet.  To grow these grains takes an incredible amount of input, diesel, labor, maintenance on equipment, chemicals in the form of fertilizer, various -icides, and medicines to stop disease in the close quarters confinement. The heavy tillage used to grow these crops has serious negative consequences including erosion, chemical run off, widespread flooding, and compaction. We also need infrastructure to [store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo), [mix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_mixer), and [feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixer-wagon). Now what happens when that feed comes out the backside? [Slurry pits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry_pit), are a common storage method, but for some operations they leave the manure there until it comes up to the cows [knee](https://cafoinfo.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/cafo-cow-in-manure.gif?w=404). Its then scooped and spread of fields, which is good except for the terrible amount of medication that can kill or inhibit good microbes in the soil. 

A little bit of an aside and anecdote. I got a couple truck loads of manure from a small beef operation next door to compost. After a few months I could go into the pile and pick out still intact pieces of cow manure, dried out and not decomposing. I also had some horse manure from a few miles away and that was completely decomposed or close to in the same amount of time. 

For this post I'm not going to get into the details of Monsanto, chemicals, or GMOs. I'm assuming everyone reading this has a basic understanding on why all that is bad and bad for you, I just want to get into the techniques and processes of the agriculture business. 

""The main reason to cut down on meat is that it allows more food to be grown and is better for the environment""

""There isn't enough land on this planet to feed a rapidly growing civilization of 7 billion people organic, grass fed, pasture raised animals.""

""Majority of corn and soy, over 70%, is grown to feed farm animals.""

These are all comments I've received and I'd like to address them. With conventional agriculture its commonplace to leave a field bare for more than half the year. HALF THE YEAR, the rest of the year its tilled bare ground or crop stubble. There is no nutrient cycling happening, no capturing the solar energy falling on the earth, no microbes being fed by root [exudates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate#Plant_exudates). Where in nature is bare ground allowed to happen, and don't say [deserts](https://www.prb.org/whatsbehinddesertification/#:~:text=Human%20activities%20that%20contribute%20to,its%20soil%20chemistry%20and%20hydrology.).

 Consider the alternatives: 

Cover crops sown in multispecies mixes to promote [plant diversity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880919302439) at the same time as a cash crop. Cash crop is harvested above cover crops. Livestock is moved onto the cover crop to graze for the fall/winter. 

Cool season cash crop direct seeded(no-till) into warm season pasture, cash crop harvested above pasture, livestock moved on to graze as normal (rotational, mob grazing).


Forest agriculture for nut production with [silvopasture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvopasture) maintained. Pigs are finished on nuts (mainly acorns) fallen to ground after harvest. 

Row cropping where a cash crop is planted between rows in an orchard or young nut tree forest before they are able to produce a crop. Cover crop techniques may also be used as well as livestock integration, although livestock may damage the smaller trees.


With the use of cover crops you can completely eliminate the need for chemical inputs as they act as a weed barrier and certain covers may be chosen for the resource requirement (legumes for nitrogen...). The cover crops serve dual purpose with livestock integration and the livestock fertilize the land, it all works together. There is no need for livestock bedding, no need to store or haul manure, no need for infrastructure to house animals or store feed (negligible amount of storage for mineral supplement if needed). 

With the food forests you are harvesting nuts for food, fuel, and oils while you are raising meat.

Also consider[ Leader-Follower grazing
](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2015/05/08/leader-follower-grazing-system/), now we can raise 4 species on the same land (cows, sheep, pigs, chickens)

""Oh well that won't work where I am...""  Do you have soil? It will work. There are regenerative ranchers growing an oasis in the middle of a desert with some of these techniques.

So I believe I covered two comments above so far. There IS enough land, we just aren't using it as efficiently as we could and the land we are using has been degraded far from productivity due to heavy tillage and chemical applications. Moving away from CAFO's and towards grass based meat production we reduce the amount of croplands and increase the amount of pastures (from destructive monocultures to healing, biodiverse landscapes). That segues into the other point ""The main reason to cut down on meat is that it allows more food to be grown and is better for the environment"". Livestock is an important tool to regenerating landscapes (think buffalo on the plains). With proper *management* livestock can reduce the amount of invasive species of plants, increase plant density, increase organic matter in the soils, create new homes for beneficial species of all life. 

Thinking about it all three of these comments are tied into each other. We don't have enough land to grow food (although his is a flawed statement because conventional farming is actually producing more food than required) because we're growing crops mostly for livestock because we don't heal the land with biodiverse pastures because we don't have  enough land.......


Well how about we break the cycle? [Support local farms](https://www.localharvest.org/) who [focus on](http://www.eatwild.com/products/) at the very least grass based production, but even better regenerative agriculture techniques. Go and VISIT these farms so you can see how they operate, ask questions, and learn more about the food you eat. If a farm won't let you visit, that's a red flag. Grow you own food! There's plenty of resources out there where you can learn to compost (crash course: take kitchen scraps, mix with leaves or woodchips, leave sit, turn every 2 months at the least) and learn to grow things. You can grow a lot of food in your backyard, you can grow a decent amount on a porch, you can grow a whole herb garden on a windowsill.

There is more to this wild claim. 

This next series of info is just extra background knowledge to prove that big pharma wouldn't care making the population dependent on them [as we know with opiods and getting the rich richer]

Monsanto, the American agriculture giant producing 80% of corn and 93% of soy products worldwide had a merger with bayer a pharmaceutical company with ties to nazi-ism as in slaved labor camps etc. They also are the same group that made asprin. 

There is a new technology in which you can get mRNA in plant based food by splicing the genes. 

Only thing is monsanto pretty much makes all food for Americans and bayer was one of the major figures in the 80s who contributed to the potential creation of the hiv virus. Commonly thought to have come from apes but more likely to have come from this drug.

 Similarly the vaccine, if applied in means similar, the vaccine and getting covid together then creates the protein spike essentially the vaccine will promote the rapid spread of hiv like a flu and not through blood or sex. 

I'm not 100% sure of the claim but here is a link to Australians who got the vaccine and got a ""false positive"" for hiv https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/australia/uq-coronavirus-vaccine-false-positive.html

Spliced food link: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070285/

I believe there is a potential link between the vaccine and HIV backed by big pharma. If you had gotten the covid vaccine, get tested asap and let people know. 

This is the mRNA sequence in the Pfizer vaccine:

If the vaccine is resisted there is a potential future where food has the mRNA strand Spliced in and that must be prevented at all cost.

If you need to report or have sufficient evidence as to why you shouldn't get the vaccine, here you go.

**American Dietetic Association**: “It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well\-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.” (Source: ""American Dietetic Association, 2009, Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets"")

**British Dietitians Association**: “Well planned vegetarian \[and strict\-vegetarian\] diets can be nutritious and healthy. They are associated with lower risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels. This could be because such diets are lower in saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fibre and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have protective properties) than non\-vegetarian diets.” 

**Dietitians of Canada**: “A healthy vegan diet has many health benefits including lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.” and “A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults.

**John Hopkins School of Public Health**: “A strong body of scientific evidence links excess meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, with heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and earlier death. Diets high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans can help prevent these diseases and promote health in a variety of ways. \[…\] The majority of the protein foods consumed in the U.S. are meat and animal products, which are often high in saturated fat and cholesterol, as opposed to the more nutrient\-dense and health\-promoting plant\-based options (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, soy products, nuts and seeds).”

**American Journal of Clinical Nutrition**: “a very low meat intake was associated with a significant decrease in risk of death in 4 \[of 6\] studies,” and “Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.”

**Harvard Health Publications**: “A meta\-analysis of 29 studies of meat consumption and colon cancer concluded that a high consumption of red meat increases risk by 28&#37;, and a high consumption of processed meat increases risk by 20&#37;.” and “It appears ‘healthy meat consumption’ has become an oxymoron \[…\] People in the study who ate the most red meat tended to die younger, and to die more often from cardiovascular disease and cancer. \[…\] even when the researchers compensated for the effects of unhealthy lifestyle, mortality and meat remained associated.”

**Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine**: “Two themes consistently emerge from studies of cancer from many sites: vegetables and fruits help to reduce risk, while meat, animal products, and other fatty foods are frequently found to increase risk. \[…\] Not surprisingly, vegetarians are at the lowest risk for cancer and have a significantly reduced risk compared to meat\-eaters.”

I personally believe them and have transitioned to a plant based diet in the last year. I also believe that there is the potential for a lot of money to be lost by the 'meat industry' and they are aggressively pushing an anti plant based, or anti vegan, message in response to the threat that a widely adopted plant based diet would pose to their bottom line. 

I'd love to hear what people in this subreddit think about plant based diets/veganism and even potential collusion between the animal agriculture industry, health industry and western governments to suppress information about the food we eat and keep us consuming unhealthy products.

there are many reasons beside humans wearing masks just being plain stupid and dangerous

&#x200B;

to breathe in the free flowing air what brings with it messages of all fellow living beings on this planet

and to freely breathe out ones very own message one wants to share with all fellow living beings

&#x200B;

its the most basic foundation human life is built upon

&#x200B;

it is dangerous to inhale the exhaled air, its damaging the physical health as well as also it induces 

a feeling of ... my information is not good enough for others, what leads to a certain self-depreciation

and that is the beginning of an eventual fatal demise on the moral self-understanding

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

beside all that ... i feel that i do not want to see other human beings wearing masks because i feel its not

good for them to wear it and also its not good for me to see them damaging theirselves

&#x200B;

also i feel sort of having to patch in my brain the missing nose and mouth ... sort of

if i would accept that human beings look like that, without mouth and nose, i would accept 

them not being in exchange with me except for our looking at each other

&#x200B;

that is how i prefer to look at a tree or a wild animal as they might not look back at me, they might even 

not take much notice of me ... but i do not have to make excuses to my brain why i am showing it these

pictures of trees and animals living undisturbed by human stupidity

&#x200B;

but then again, its difficult to go into a forest in switzerland and not see the horrible stuff humans do,

how they kill them trees for no reason but for greed

&#x200B;

we could perfectly well heat our homes with hemp stalks, the inner part of the hemp stalks

&#x200B;

there is even one company who was able to find a way how to press the outer parts of the hemp stalks,

the stuff what is used to make clothes, to press this hemp wool into solid logs, using some soy based

binding stuff to make them hemp fibres stick together

&#x200B;

we could basicly build scyscrapers of pressed hemp wool logs and would take out a lot of co2 from the air

plus help the earth while planting hemp as it is good for the soil and the seeds are so nutritious

and healty

&#x200B;

and these 3 meter high growing fields of hemp would add some loads of oxygen into the air ...

&#x200B;

but back to the mask stuff

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

i am very unhappy that now since more than a year the 7 federal council of switzerland

who have till 13th of june 2021 abused emergency laws to demand of 8.4 million people living

in switzerland to wear masks in public transport and shops

&#x200B;

( since 13th of june 2021 all these emergency powers have been confirmed by 60 percent of votes

in a nationwide voting ... i still have a very hard time understanding it, how could my fellow

swiss citizen people have voted with 60 percent in favor of this tyranny ... it regularly drives me

towards the edge of insanity to think about it ... )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

altough i do not shop often, i try to only go once in a week into a shop to get vegetables and apples, oats

and flour, yeast and other stuff ...

&#x200B;

i still feel very uncomfortable to be in a room of 10 people wearing masks, it induces shame in me both to 

witness that sad existance we seem to cultivate

&#x200B;

we fear each others breath

&#x200B;

or 

&#x200B;

we allow them political representatives, them nation state employees to treat us like we would be a danger to each

other

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

and then i release it all by telling myself

&#x200B;

we are okay, this too shall pass

&#x200B;

we human beings know of the happy moment when we gather together to dance and be happy in groups, when we lough out loudly

because of joy and someone said something funny, we still believe in that we are good for each other, all of us is good

for each other, our breath, our looks, our movement

&#x200B;

we will not give that believe up

&#x200B;

we will prevail knowing that we are one human family

China's new mega-cities will get wiped out along with humanity's manufacturing base. We had 12, once-in-a-thousand year, storms during the last 2 years in the US south east. We are facing more, once-in-a-millennial, droughts in the US southwest. We are draining the groundwater in the Midwest to grow corn oil we burn in our cars and to flush fracked oil and gas wells.

Most of earth's land is in the northern hemisphere and is losing mass so fast that it shows up on satellite gravity readings. The northern land is losing snow, ice and groundwater so fast that the whole top half of the planet is rebounding in fits and jolts, awakening volcanos and earthquakes over places like Iceland and the Ring of Fire under Fukushima.

The Pacific and Atlantic US coasts are both facing super giant tsunami risks, one from California or British Columbia sliding into the ocean, and two, is a major underwater landslide threat from the Azores off Africa, that will send a tidal wave across the Atlantic in six hours. China is building nuclear reactors as fast as it can in coastal danger zones threatened by quake and Tsunami zones.

2° Celsius will reach the US Midwest 20 years ahead of the rest of the planet in areas where we are already over-using groundwater. The Midwest will face more droughts mixed with more major flooding events that will combine to wash and blow away soil at faster and faster rates. The GM corn and soy we grow there are killing the soil and insects making it weaker and weaker. 

We are pumping poisoned frack wastewater under groundwater where earthquakes cause the poisoned water to leak back into the groundwater tables. We are draining the groundwater to grow a fuel additive to our cars.

Our micro-fibers and micro-plastics are infecting the water and ocean food chains and ending up in our systems because we are the top predator and we are eating ourselves alive with poison.

We are raping, killing, bombing, burning, starving and scaring people alive with hired killers and drones for the oil and gas we need to keep our economy from imploding. We are too scared to fix things because we're afraid of crashing the system. We are too broken to fix.

We do not have enough energy, food and water for everyone and the pace of violence will have to increase several fold. The tropical zones are dying right now. The Amazon jungle is one or two mega-droughts from runaway self-sustained destruction. This will absolutely happen because all the once-in-a-millennial events will become commonplace and merge into a mess beyond our imaginations. 

The oceans are dying so fast fish clean-ups are commonplace. The oceans are entering a 10-20 year phase of sending excess heat overland. El Ninos and La Ninas will be commonplace norms. 

All of our infrastructure needs are so great we no way to pay for it all. We have 75,000 dams in the US that are old and facing stresses they weren't designed to face.

Antibodies in GMO corn \(and other products\) may be causing reduced birth rates through lowered sperm efficiency and zygote resistance. GMO corns, soys, and other derived foods **may** contain sperm latching antibodies. Mitigation procedures include: halting the consumption of foods containing antibodies, cardiovascular exercise, exposure to extreme heat such as a sauna [\*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ac502529q), and higher rates of sexual discharge.

# 

# Intro

The fertility rate of western civilization has declined significantly in the past two decades, with the sharpest decrease in birthrate occuring in the past five years. Reduction in reproductive rates and increases in infertility can be blamed on many causes: obesity [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521747/), lack\-of\-exercise [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5675222/), and stress [3](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140529100719.htm). Peer reviewed studies and the author's anecdotal evidence support this claim.

>*The fertility of the population of the United States is below replacement among those native born, and above replacement among immigrant families and the socially deprived \(Singh et al., 2001\)* [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/)

However, there is an underreported cause of birthrate reduction in the western world\-\-\-autoimmune antibody consumption.

# 

# Antibody Production in the Body

Antibodies are created by the body in the following manner:

>*When an organism’s immune system encounters a foreign molecule \(typically a protein\) for the first time, specialized cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells capture the molecule and begin breaking it down so that it can present these antigens to B cell lymphocytes.*  
>  
>*Once Antigen Presentation to the B cell lymphocytes has occurred, a process known as Somatic Hypermutation allows the B cell to begin coding for a new antibody that will contain a unique Antigen Binding Site in the variable region that is capable of binding specifically to an epitope from the antigen.*  
>  
>*Each B cell lymphocyte produces one unique antibody against one unique epitope.*  
>  
>*Once antibodies with sufficient specificity to the epitope can be encoded, the B cell begins to release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies then bind specifically with the foreign molecule and allow the immune system to eliminate the molecule from the system.*  
>  
>*In some cases, these antibodies can disable pathogens such as viruses directly due to the binding action. In other cases, such as with bacterial pathogens, these antibodies bind to surface proteins on the bacterium’s surface, thereby signaling to the rest of the immune system that the pathogen should be destroyed.* [5](https://www.pacificimmunology.com/resources/antibody-introduction/how-are-antibodies-produced/)

# 

# Consumption of Antibodies & Antibody Absorption into the Bloodstream

Given that antibodies' main function is to **disable** pathogens throughout the body in various mediums \(bloodstream, interstitial fluid, mucus, etc.\) they are quite useful in deterring against repeat immune system attacks. Vaccines work through the mechanism of memory B cells; exposing an immune system to a dummy pathogen and creating memory B cells that can fight the real virus.

Antibodies can be consumed, not just produced, by the body. An example of antibody consumption and absorption is breastfeeding [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2107673/),[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12850343). In the process of breast feeding

>*In mammals, passive immunity is transferred from mother to offspring by transplacental passage or by intestinal absorption.* [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2107673/)

Consumption of antibodies does not result in the formation of memory B cells for that antibody. Thus, the antibody only lasts for the half\-life of the underlying molecular structure.

An important note about the functioning of antibodies; antibodies are not smart, they are puzzle pieces that cripple artifacts which contain a specific antigen. Similar to how a ball and chain slows down a prisoner, an **Antibody blocks an artifact from movement.**

# 

# Antibodies in Food

Given that antibodies can be consumed, they allow the body to use them as if they were produced by its own memory B cells. Thus, items that you eat may be changing your immunity. An example of this is breast feeding.

### Genetically Modified Foods

GMO foods most likely contain antibodies as well, meaning that you are consuming immunology from an engineered plant. **GMO foods are not required to distribute information on or disclose which genes are added to the genetics of the plant. Thus, scientists have developed GMO corn that can cure herpes [8](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/sep/09/gm.food). However, scientists also have developed GMO corn that act as spermicides [8](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/sep/09/gm.food).**

#

# Risks and Proliferation

The company that developed and patented the technique for modifying spermicidal corn [8](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/sep/09/gm.food) was eventually acquired by Monsanto, the GMO giant. It is conceivable that those techniques are in use today.

> Corn syrups, soy leitchins, and other products could very well contain spermicidal antibodies. -muchCode

#

# Mitigation Techniques

* Stop consumption of Antibodies
* Wait out the half-life of the Antibodies [link](http://www.wikilite.com/half-life-of-igg-iga-and-igm)
* Visit a high temperature place (40-70 C) such as a steam room to encourage antibody unfolding.  [link](http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0003004.html)
* Reduce the concentration of Antibody in the body through a increase in sexual discharge.",conspiracy,Soy

I remember it was written in the Bible something along the lines that even evil works toward the good of those who love God.   


Anyway my thoughts on why things are the way they are.

First idea is that God has bigger plans that uses evil. This is all biblical prophesy. The weeds that grew with the wheat. They are the example of what not to be like for when the new world arrives. Earth could be seen as either a training ground or a playground. Those who were deceived or 'failed' the test will be removed from the Earth due to their ignorance's when the right time comes. They've already ran out of lies and all they can do is keep what they have left going, which is already starting to crumble. The three main untruths, Space travel / big bang theory, along with Germ theory and Evolution theory. Those who come to know all those lies will form a strong impenetrable community of light, well those who loved the truth, so that they can never actually be lied or convinced by darkness again, about anything. 

Second idea, those in control are actually more like ""A.I"" that are there to test humans, to test them to see if they will stay righteous, to see if they will betray God, to see if they judge with good judgement and to test if they will love the truth over the lusts of the world that bring death. Even the 'evil' people show themselves in plain sight, it seems like that's part of their programming. Maybe a percentage of humans are actually not truly human, and they are only here to enact the world stage of events that lead to the finale. Like it really makes no sense for humans to betray and attempt to enslave their own kind, their own brothers and sisters, I would never do that, nor do I know anyone that would. 

&#x200B;

But yeah I'm open to hear what anyone else thinks of why all these lies? Do they truly believe they can hold them forever? Will we end up stuck in metaverse eating soy protein day in and out and be happy about it? Is the end of the world coming?  
Just FYI: I won't respond to people who argue that Space travel and big bang and that we are truly whizzing through dangerous space using a bunch of billions of years coincidences to back their claims, or that germs are evil and vaccines are the best thing ever, I know how these discussions go, and they go nowhere.",conspiracy,Soy

The mental health system has recently taken a shot at making healthy food choices appear dangerous, if you can imagine, especially when those choices are your top priority.

Clinicians are actively diagnosing patients with orthorexia nervosa, the extreme desire to eat pure food.

This is not a parody. It's actually happening.

If you have a strong desire to eat pure, uncontaminated food, then you could be suffering from a mental disorder per this new medical labeling trend.

According to the Guardian:

Orthorexics commonly have rigid rules around eating. Refusing to touch sugar, salt, caffeine, alcohol, wheat, gluten, yeast, soy, corn and dairy foods is just the start of their diet restrictions. 

Any foods that have come into contact with pesticides, herbicides or contain artificial additives are also out.

Doctors and mental health professionals are very concerned, of course, as orthorexia nervosa seems to be 'on the rise.'

Ursula Philpot, chairperson of the British Dietetic Association mental health division, was quoted as follows:

I am definitely seeing significantly more orthorexics than just a few years ago. Other eating disorders focus on quantity of food but orthorexics can be overweight or look normal. 

They are solely concerned with the quality of the food they put in their bodies, refining and restricting their diets according to their personal understanding of which foods are truly pure.

Philpot further asserts:

Those most susceptible are middle-class, well-educated people who read about food scares in the papers, research them on the internet, and have the time and money to source what they believe to be purer alternatives.

Are you with me? If you are well-educated, like to do your own research and eat only foods that you (all by yourself) determine to be healthy and pure, then it is safe to say that you are at risk for 'catching' orthorexia nervosa.

Yes, orthorexia, is something that you can catch like a disease, according to the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA). On the NEDA website, they ask the questions: Why does someone get orthorexia? This positions orthorexia as capable of latching onto you like a cold.

Typical cold or flu symptoms. Blocked sinuses, shallower breathing, sore throats and coughs, loose stools, vomiting, fatigue, you name it. As children we are taught by our parents that it's just a stomach bug going around, it's just the cold, etc. Children will trust basically anything their parents tell them so these beliefs get ingrained into us and only until we come to a point of questioning it may we find out things aren't as they seemed, although not many do that as they are too occupied with their 'lives'.

It was only until I looked into Germ Theory and Terrain Theory in my own personal time that made me question the viral contagion mainstream narrative. You know the saying, follow the money. Well the first difference I noticed straight away, germ theory generates insane amounts of money through the sale of treatments toward germs and viruses. This alone makes me feel something is very wrong. If the Terrain Theory turned up to be more accurate representation of why we get diseased then real treatments would be changing our lifestyles to be less toxic. This can't exactly be sold as medical treatments. It would make us live in a healthier environment. We would stop eating processed foods, we would stop living in pollution, we would stop buying soaps and detergents and taking drugs because bacteria and viruses are not the enemy in the Terrain Theory, toxicity is. 

It was then that I found seemingly by luck that there are people out there eating raw animal food for years without ever becoming infected or sick, or poisoned. That their health compared to the average citizen was tenfold. They would not get any flu or cold. My brain could not figure this out at first, how do they not get poisoned? I soon realized all other animals do not question the dangers of raw meat, they just eat it, they aren't afraid of invisible bacteria or viruses. Why would we be different? So what actually poisons us in terms of raw meat? Factory farming. They say that it's the bacteria on the raw meat that poison us, but in reality, it's the vaccinations, the anti-biotics, the chemically treated grain and soy that they are fed and the hellish conditions they are contained in that taint the meat, and only when we cook it thoroughly destroying the poisons then it is edible. If that was true and people realized this, who would eat that? They would not get a single sale, Big Farm and Big Pharma would collapse. Only when bacteria is blamed can they keep selling this poison. This is how much money and power and greed the Germ Theory generates. Now can you imagine the amount of Propaganda they have made to keep this alive? Just look at all the games, movies, etc that make raw meat poisonous or bad. How many people have they bought out and brainwashed? 

Now part of me still wasn't convinced so I needed to experiment. I decided I will eat raw meat and try it myself. I located a local family farm and started there, by eating the organs and muscle meat raw. I ate this way for an entire year and did not get sick once. I won't speak of health benefits but instead the fact I am yet to be poisoned by the so called bacteria that Google says is unsafe after leaving meat out for two hours. I even eventually tried raw chicken, at this point I'm completely convinced as I eat like this for another year, including all forms of raw meat. I'd even leave it out on the shelf for a week or more, then eat it. No poisoning. Makes sense to me now, we aren't in a world of fear. They create that world of fear for us when we are born, it's their matrix to keep us enslaved. I have been consuming raw animal food for over three years now.

So through my own experience I can confidently say bacteria is NOT MY enemy.  
I would have to be insane to believe anyone saying that it is.  


Now what about viruses and contagion? I won't be surprised if something is wrong here too.  
Surely they've done experiments and studies that prove these viruses cause diseases right? They'd must of at this point. I. Can't. Find. One. Scientific. Study. WHAT? There are no experiments done of a purified virus being inhaled and causing disease... all the studies they've done to prove a virus causing disease are things like injecting some form of beef broth into a cows eyeball and the reaction must mean the virus infected them. That's not purified and physically isolated. That is not how infection occurs naturally between two humans. Look how infectious omicron is supposed to be, surely it will be easy to get a little spray of isolated viruses and spray at the test subjects and reporting if they become infected? They can't even prove SARS-COV-2 exists outside of a computer generation from the RNA soup of someone 'infected'. I started looking into the virus theory before the pandemic even began. So again to experiment I've been trying to get infected purposely throughout the pandemic. Nothing. No infection. I don't wear masks, don't use sanitizers or soaps, I'm around sick people all the time. Why am I not getting the disease?  


Maybe it's something to do with:

\- Removing all soaps, detergents and anti-bacterial lotions, including shampoo's and conditioners.  
\- Removing of all processed sugars, oils, additives, preservatives and any processed food.  
\- Removing all factory meat and changing it to pastured organic local meat that I eat raw.  
\- Not eating pesticide ridden monocrops, instead locally grown organic. I don't eat any grain.  
\- Not cooking with non-stick pans. I rarely cook at all actually.  
\- Removing plastic clothing and materials and replacing it with organic plant-based bio-degradable.  
\- No longer taking any medicines or drugs whatsoever, no pills, not even supplements.  


Basically removing the toxic shit in our life makes us stop getting sick. Sounds like common sense.  
Not viruses or bacteria. Sadly, people don't want to admit their lifestyle is a result of their illness. It's better to believe and blame it was the bacteria or viruses fault so they can keep living in ignorance and suffering. A flu is the body trying to heal you, do not stop it with any drug, not even ivermectin, unless it's so severe you'll die which is extremely unlikely.  


TL;DR

To test the germ theory I ate pastured raw meat for years to see if I'd get poisoned by bacteria. I didn't. Factory farmed raw meat can be poisonous because of the way the animals are treated and how the meat is processed.  
Stopped getting flu's and illness after I removed all toxicity out of my life that I can personally do which lead to my prediction I would not get 'COVID'.  
Unclean air is still a factor of toxicity most of us have to live with but it seems even then a nutritious raw diet and a non toxic lifestyle counteracts the toxicity accumulated through the air.   
I conclude through my own experimentation Germ and Viral Theory is a fraud and it's become an almost un-killable beast through all the propaganda and indoctrination.",conspiracy,Soy

The institutions doing the studies are often corrupt themselves. When people invoke the word science.... they don't consider it as practiced in imperfect hands, and instead of having a more meaningful understanding of the study, they trust the scientific authorities above all else. 

We almost collectively understand corruption and compromise when it comes to certain industries and their funded studies such as dairy vs soy, or big pharma. However, despite a large portion of society already having skepticism of the aforementioned, It is taboo to even consider the recent vaccines as potentially dangerous or that climate change science could be wrong in many aspects. 

What is interesting is that at the same time our culture suffers from nihilism: An ultra type of skepticism that nothing is real or has meaning. This has fostered the concept of subjective truth... or ""what is true to you is true"".

The ironic part of this cultural poison is that The scientific community has been relatively unscathed by it. The people who proudly proclaim ""what is true to you is true"" are some of the most trusting of authority. It's seemingly paradoxical that this nihilism and subjective reality coexists in a collective that has resounding faith in authority. 

The only way out of this is to adopt and spread the concepts of healthy skepticism and objective truth. It just can't be  mere concepts but it must be embedded further up the hierarchy of reason.",conspiracy,Soy

Vaclav Smil says a 100% energy transition takes 70 years to complete.

Many say we can have 100% renewable energy in 30 years.

It all depends on what you call ""renewable energy"".

Europe gets 50% of its ""renewable energy"" by burning trees for electricity, that are shipped in from all over the world.

They don't count the emissions from this energy because they say the trees will grow back in 50 years, we don't got 50 years.

Wood is humanity's oldest energy, we have never stopped burning it. 

Diesel fuels in Europe are 8% palm or soy oil. This is called ""bio-fuel"". 

Indonesia poisoned elephants in a national park so that they could clear cut it, ship the trees to Europe for green energy, grow palm oil where the trees once were, and then ship the palm oil to Europe to burn in cars. Africa is doing the same. All this stuff is called green energy.

Germany is relocating whole villages to dig up dirty brown coal to keep their solar and wind energy setup going.

Then on a sunny breezy day in Summer, you see a headline saying Germany gets 40% of its electricity from renewable energy. But remember, 50% of that energy comes from burning trees. It gets worse.

Electricity is only 20% of all the energy we use a species. That's why energy transitions take so long.

The very best we can do is get 20% of total energy use renewable by 2040. 

Solar and wind make up at best 2% of total energy use.

Hydro dams emit methane and destroys wildlife.

When you include burning trees, palm, corn and soy oil, it's 4% of total energy use. Africa and South America are growing soy and palm oil like crazy. 50% of South America's soy crop is shipped to feed China's pigs.

We've only had extreme weather like now since 2005.

As part of total energy use, solar and wind are replacing fossil energy at the rate of 1% per decade. It's nowhere near enough.

To stay below 1.5° C, we have to reduce total fossil use 50% in 10 years.

To stay below 2.0° C, we have to reduce fossil use 100% in 20 years.

We are already at 1.0° C = Dangerous Climate Change Now.

Yet it still takes 70 years to change energy use 100%.

Water use will exceed supplies by 40% in 10 years.

We are set to run out of soil in 50 years.

Crops are going to get hit hard going forward.

We will run out of water and soil before we get 100% renewable energy.

The US/Saudi/Israeli axis of evil wants war.

If there is no major breakthrough this election, we're all toast.

The best we can hope for is to slow down the collapse of civilization.

Nobody will tell you this because there's still money to be made keeping the lies alive. I'm doing this for free.

Lance means spear and rotti means to break. Lancerotti is another Italian variation of the more commonly used Lancellotti family name. The Breakspear family produced the only English pope in history who was Pope Adrian IV or Nicolas Breakspear. Pope Adrian IV issued the papal bull Laudabiliter ordering the Normans in England to invade Ireland which they did and bring it under Papal-Roman authority which they also did. This is why Ireland is predominantly Roman Catholic today. Cardinal Boso Breakspeare was a relative of Pope Adrian IV and a both Italian and English. The musician Cindy Breakspeare fathered Damian Marley with Bob Marley. Damian Marley is a descendent of Pope Adrian IV and a part owner of the Jamaican Mafia or Jamaican Posse which have large operations in London. The Jamaican Posse are involved in marijuana trafficking and use these profits for financing their other criminal activities including human trafficking. Damian Marley is a ruthless mobster.

Breakspear or Lancellotti is also where the character of Lancelot comes from in the Legend of Arthur. The House of Maggi were a nobility from the commune in Brescia Italy right next door to the commune of Merlino all within the province of Lombardy. Magi or Maggi mean a magician or wizard just as Merlin like Merlino was a wizard in the Arthurian legend. The head of the Philly crime family is Joey Merlino and he gets his name from Merlino, Lombardy. One of Joey Merlino's top crime bosses is the mobster Michael Lancelotti. The Gaetanis are part owners of the Philly Mob and Prince Gelasio Gaetani who calls himself the ""Wizard of Wine"" is friends with Prince Filippo Massimo-Lancellotti. The Maggi family settled in Switzerland and became wealthy after Julius Maggi merged his Maggi soup and seasonings company with Nestle. The Maggi family also settled in Brazil establishing the Amaggi Soybean Group owned by Blairo Maggi who is worth about 960 million. Too much soy can cause an increase in estrogen in men and it can also be unhealthy for women. They have been adding soy into foods where it doesn't belong. These Illuminati bloodlines are ancient and they go back for thousands of years. The Maggi family go back to Persia and India and derive their name from Majhi and Maji. Magi are also the term used for followers of Zoroastrianism which derived from Persia and Iran. 

Maggio Cipriani is a Venetian international businessman that owns restaurants and bars including in New York City. Maggio Cipriani's family are white collar mobsters with his father Giuseppe and grandfather Arrigo arrested for tax evasion in the United States. In the Book of Matthew myrrh pronounced like ""mer"" is an herb that was given as a gift by the three magi or three wise men. Herbs and chemicals are used in sorcery for inducing trance like states that enable mind control or bewitchment. Myrrh can also be ingested or used like an incense and is likely being added into food and wine covertly to enhance their witchcraft. Druids similar to wizards used holly wood.  Mark Breakspear is a Hollywood special effects designer and Michael Breakspear is an Australian neuroscientist who specializes in studying oscillating wave patters and their effects on the brain. They are sorcerers involved with illusions, deceptions, and lawlessly imposing electronic induced brainwashing and mind control frequencies. The Breakspear family in London own a crematorium as well where the Breakspears and Massimos of Roccasecca which live in London make human sacrifices. The Lancellotti family of Italy merged a branch with the Massimo family with current members that include Prince Ludovisi Massimo-Lancellotti, Prince Ascanio Massimo-Lancellotti and Prince Filippo Massimo-Lancellotti as the head of this family today.

I say this as a first hand witness to some of their misdeeds and as an independent researcher/investigator/infiltrator. For all outward appearances they seem like a relatively innocuous group. Quiet.

THE 1999 CDC (EIS) SMOKING GUN....obtained through FOIA

Using the Hep B vaccine as a control, one group had the 25 micrograms of  mercury Hep B birth shot, the other group did not. Both groups had all other vaccines on the schedule.

RESULT: AUTISM RR: 7.6

Statistically, this means that there was a 7.6 times GREATER  (relative) risk of autism with the Hep B dose (25 micrograms of mercury) schedule than the one without. Any relative risk over 1 should trigger a safety investigation. Instead it was covered up, just like the CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson's study. (See the film VAXXED for the  full story).

# WHAT IS A NEWBORN'S RISK OF CONTRACTING HEP B?

As of now it is recommended that ALL newborns (in the US at least) are given the Hep B vaccine. What are the risks of a newborn contracting Hep B?

According to the Hep B PATENT:

""Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic DNA virus that infects humans and may result in two clinical outcomes. In the majority of clinical infections in adults (90-95%), the virus is cleared after several weeks or months, and the patient develops a lifelong immunity against re-infection. In the remaining cases, however, the virus is not eliminated from the tissues, and the patient remains chronically infected.""

[https://patents.google.com/patent/US6921534B2/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6921534B2/en)

**The highest risk group are adults practicing sodomy and using injected drugs (shared needles).**

[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hepatitis+b++gay+sex&t=osx&ia=web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hepatitis+b++gay+sex&t=osx&ia=web)

So, exactly how does a Hep B vaccine work?

The original one, given at birth:

""Multiepitope peptide‐loaded virus‐like particles as a vaccine against hepatitis B virus–related hepatocellular carcinoma""

""Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may cause acute and chronic hepatitis, which in turn may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1 The HBV vaccines currently used in immunization have lowered the incidence of HBV infection, but they are ineffective as a treatment for patients with hepatitis and HCC.2 In acute HBV infection, both type 1 CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes and CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that are HBV‐specific contribute to effective control of HBV.3, However, chronic HBV infection is rarely resolved by the  immune system. Thus, broadly specific Th lymphocyte and CTL responses  against various HBV antigens would be a new approach to improve the efficacy of a candidate therapeutic vaccine.""

[https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hep.22816](https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hep.22816)

We are exposed to lots of xenoestrogens in the environment, such as from plastics (which are conveniently everywhere thanks to big oil) containing PCBs and BPA which disrupt our natural hormone chemistry. This is also due to GMO soy or soy in general that has the effect of mimicking estrogen, which is also conveniently everywhere in many processed or pre-packaged foods. Why do you think that a lot of males we see (including ourselves) look ""hipster"" or effeminate compared to our ancestors or grandfathers? Why are more straight males less interested in sex or have sexual problems? Why are there more gays than ever before, more than the typical deviant percentage? Why do we now we have more people like ""Caitlyn"" Jenner becoming transgender? A lot hormone-altering chemicals are being exposed to us prior, during and after birth that affect our physical and mental development as a human being. In the past few decades we have seen a surge of ""confused"" people and I strongly believe that this is the reason why. This is possibly part of the population control agenda by the elite globalists. When we are so confused and distracted, amongst a host of other things in life that have been engineered by design, we can't organize an effective resistance let alone live healthy lives.

Es fundamentalmente un hecho que desde hace unos años tras el mote de conspiración se han escondido los odiadores de todos los tiempos,los verdaderos elitistas o sus marionetas que son tontos utiles para la diseminación bajo el manto del cientifismo de una ideologia que sintetiza la Lucha de Clases y la Supremacía Blanca...bajo el estandarte inverosimil de una combinación de psiquicos-millonarios-judios-extraterrerestres para resultar en el nuevo chivo-expiatorio el cual todos deben odiar y eliminar por el bien de los que inhumanamente señalando a otros de extraterrestres se llaman asi mismos humanos y son capaces cual semidioses de decidir quien es humano y quien no.
Esta nueva variante ideologica de la ideologia dominante desea establecer su oposición a los psiquicos, que son un nuevo hombre incipiente,estableciendo que estos ultimos son ademas ricos y judios porque siempre han dominado al resto de la humanidad,lo cual es falso (preguntenle al carpintero de nazareth cual era su estrategia de dominación porque ser crucificado no es precisamente mi idea de gobernar)...y que esta dominación es alienigena,por tanto estos psiquicos es justificable tratarlos inhumanamente:privandoles de propiedades,vida social y participación política.
Es entonces que este nuevo hombre es hipoteticamente extraterrestre y por tanto tratarlo inhumanamente es permitido,pues valen holocaustos y gulags...todo lo que deseen,simple y llanamente porque este nuevo hombre amenaza la fragilidad del homo sapiens que esta en decadencia y en franca desventaja ante este nuevo hombre.
Pero oiganme bien los psiquicos,analgicos,telepatas,telequinesicos,etc. No son instrumentos del sistema mundial (por ello los estan condenando a la desaparición a traves de esta nueva propaganda de guerra que es la teoria extraterrestre),no son intrumentos ciegos de aparatos de ningun estado y no son vasallos de ninguna nueva religión imperial,como es la ideologia de guerra que teoriza la inhumanidad de los psiquicos.
Terminologías como hibridación,establece que la impureza racial marcada por la presencia del gen psiquico marca su inhumanidad. Esto sucedio durante la conquista española,durante la cual el mestizo,asi como el negro y el indio no tenian alma segun el status quo.
Hacer cosas tan deslesnables como publicar fotos con nombre y apellido y dirección de supuestos extraterrestres que pueden bien ser solo psiquicos comunes,es algo sumamente condenable.Que decir sobre la publicación de supuestos linajes extraterrestres,cosa que es totalmente abominable. Esta es la peor bajesa propagandistica que he podido estudiar...y los que la pregonan trabajan para la ideologia dominante a la cual le conviene siempre desaparecer sus competidores,porque la elite dominante tiene muy poco de psiquico pero mucho de inhumano.
Y ello les hace sentir amenazados:porque saber el futuro,o los secretos del alguien...coloca a los psiquicos muy cerca de lo que muchos textos antiguos describen como estereotipo de lo divino. Y el stablishment no aceptara competición en este campo,para el stablishment y la masa ignara la versión imperial y gubernamental estos son los unicos dioses admisibles.
No explican porque si los psiquicos gobiernan el mundo y ademas son judios y ricos.Porque los martirizan,los persiguen y les procesan inquisitoriamente? 
Los que pregonan esta nueva ideologia de odio,propaganda de guerra que solo va a beneficiar a los perros de la guerra,sueñan con que su matriz de opinion se encarne politicamente,y para mal de la humanidad ello esta sucediendo...da pena ajena,como gobiernos,ministros y militares del mundo salen a aplaudir estos supuestos de inhumanidad de los psiquicos (nuevo hombre),como si no hubieran aprendido la lección del pasado.
Todo por alimentar la economia de guerra que nutre las potencias mundiales,que como dije tienen muy poco de psiquico y mucho de inhumano.
Por mas diferencias que tenga con los CDC,o con la politica imperial (no con los ciudadanos del imperio) y gubernamental (no con las personas sino con las ideas),jamas seria capaz de semejante brutalidad como es señalar la culpabilidad,prejuzgando del todo,de los EEUU (como Estado,no como politica gubernamental)...y ademas añadir epitetos deshumanizantes como repiles,extraterrestres y toda esta sarta de calificativos vejatorios,y llenos de trato cruel y degradante; que bien puede ser juzgado por tribunales internacionales en un futuro cercano.
Y ojo,no soy el mas amante del Tio Sam y todos lo saben,pero no soy amigo de nosotros o de ellos,soy amigo de las personas,y tengo personas amigas entre ellos y nosotros como cualquier persona que no mira la realidad en blanco y negro.
Pero quiero que vean todos que este genero de ideologia de guerra y de odio dice que los psiquicos son extraterrestres (en una logica tremendamente elemental) y que son los dioses explotadores de la antiguedad; pero el unico que esta jugando a ser dios es el que se atreve a decidir quien es humano y quien no. Y dejeme decirle, los psiquicos no son extraterreres y tienen los mismos derechos que usted (al menos en el papel) y no tienen ninguna autoridad para condenar a las personas por ser diferentes,por tener alguna ventaja biologica comparativa o por que les intimida la idea de que alguien sepa lo que les va a pasar,pueda leer su mente,etc. No juzguen.
Creanlo o no quienes trabajan para la versión imperial de la historia son los que afianzan la deshumanización de los psiquicos,y pór tanto dan un instrumento ideologico para su explotación. Porque de acuerdo a ello no son humanos por tanto su trato cruel ,degradante e inhumano es justificable. No va a ser posible,y su nueva ideologia de superioridad racial (señalando que los psiquicos son una raza erosionada,o deteriorada de extraterrestres),y obrerista (por pretender que los psiquicos son ricos malevolos).No va a surtir efecto.No.
Ni una inquisición mas,ni una hoguera templaria mas,ni una caceria de brujas mas,ni un holocausto mas,ni una contrarreforma mas,ni un gulag mas.

Here's the truth you're not being told.

Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is factually incorrect.

We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.

But electricity production is only 18% of total world energy demand.

82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.

The other 82% of the world's energy is used to extract minerals to construct roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel and food so we can eat and relax. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know? Here you go.

Total World Energy Demand = TWED


18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.

82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.

In 20 years, solar-wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide only 6% of TWED by 2030.

When you hear projections about solar-wind generating 50% of electrical power by 2050, that's really only 9% of TWED.
100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.

But, it takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant simply because they don't produce energy all the time.

That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power plants.

Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% intermittent TWED.

CONCLUSION:
 We require 10X the electric energy we use now to solve 18% of the emissions problem. Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure. Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades, demanding more energy and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

Solar and wind power are an energy trap.

It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.

Business As Usual = BAU

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.

Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.

In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says Scientific American. They call it, ""The End of Human Agriculture."" Humanity's soil is eroding and degrading away at 24 million acres per year. This number will increase with severe droughts, storms and low-land floods.

50% of Asia's low-land rice paddies are threatened.

50% of humanity depends on rice to survive.

A 100% TWED transition will take 2 generations to get done -- minimum. It is a vastly more difficult and complex goal than you are told.

We are losing earth's soil and fresh water faster than we can effect 100% renewable TWED.

In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the British Foreign Office.

In my opinion, in 30 years we won't have enough fossil fuel for a 100% renewable TWED transition.

This is the most important fact I've learned:

Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch to renewable energy with BAU. Without massive political-economic change, civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don't worry, I like to fix things.

Animal Agriculture = AA

Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate biomass

Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions

Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area

Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *
 * Net Primary Production.

50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to feed their pigs. Rainforests are cleared to grow animal feed and the required fresh water is, in reality, diverted to China. The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.

50% of China's rivers have vanished since 1980.

60% of China's groundwater is too poisoned to touch.

50% of China's cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.

Animal Agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we can effect 100% intermittent TWED transition with BAU.

7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting food without major incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.

Without using James Hansen's 100% private tax dividends to carbon tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100% private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.

100% for you, 
    0% for gov.

The funny thing is that eating meat and fire saved our ancestors from extinction and now eating meat and fire will cause mass extinction of all the life we love on earth. Survival is not an optional menu item as is eating meat. We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because there'll be no one left to remember us.

Michael Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3 years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25 years simply because of meat consumption.

We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 60% of your carbon tax dividend money. This is 100% in direct opposition to James Hansen's tax dividend plan and immoral. Hansen said that governments should get 0% of that money, not 60%.  I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to be phased in over 10 years.

James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government would be 100% excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to control 60% of that money. They are divisive and confrontational and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary dreams. We don't have time for this endless fighting. We only have time to unite and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st century is about a revolving door of money and power for socialists, and not the environment.

99% of Rhinos gone since 1914.

97% of Tigers gone since 1914.

70% of Marine Birds gone since 1950.

28% of Land Animals gone since 1970.

97% - Humans & Livestock are 97% of land-air vertebrate biomass.

10,000 years ago we were 0.01% of land-air vertebrate biomass.

Humans and livestock caused 80% of land-air vertebrate species extinctions and occupy half the land on earth.

1,000,000 humans, net, are added to earth every 4½ days.

Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them, and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10-year ban.

The truth is, we don’t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.

There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year. There are also a number of scientists all around the world who oppose them.

By slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment. The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they’ll be treated in the same way. The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki doesn’t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. It’s very very bad science, we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically, applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. There’s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion – Geneticist David Suzuki

If anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat, they haven’t done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption, we just don’t know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic, GMO-free methods, so there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around.

Below I’ve presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research.

1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood

Research from Canada (the first of its kind) has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women’s blood. They also found the presence of Monsanto’s Bt toxin. The study was published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.(1) 

Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women. Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known. Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.” (1)

The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.) This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.

2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchers emphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism.(2)

In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access, well respected peer-reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. It’s great to see this study published in it, confirming what many have been suspected for years.

Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free of plant DNA. (2)

This still doesn’t mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer (later in this article) it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we don’t know, and this study demonstrates another cause for concern.

3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

This study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), and uses data from the US department of Agriculture, US Environmental Protection Agency, medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. (3)(4) The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease:

Intestinal permeability

Imbalanced gut bacteria

Immune activation and allergic response

Impaired digestion

Damage to the intestinal wall

The Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health, environment, agriculture and more.

4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

In November 2012, The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled ‘Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize’ by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at France’s Caen University. (5)

It was a very significant study, which obviously looks bad for the big biotech companies like Monsanto, being the first and only long-term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide.

This study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process.

It’s also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts, and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can’t be denied, something happened.

The multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here.

GM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use

5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

A study is published in the US National Library of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosate’s potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors. (6)

Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol.

Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. (6)

Researchers also determined that Monsanto’s roundup is considered an “xenoestrogen,” which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.

6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto’s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosate’s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. (7)

Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry’s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission’s final review report. (7)

Here is a summary of the report:

Multiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate

Industry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses

Industry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses

The German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations

The EU Commission’s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations

The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate

Another study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.(8)

The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields (8)

7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

When you ingest Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. It’s completely unnatural and the body doesn’t resonate with it. P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down.

CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans that’ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. (9)

8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. (10)

To this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin.

Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals. Even more alarming, glyphosate was detected in the urine of the farmers. (10)

9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

A study by scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. (11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.

The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.

10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. (12)(13)(14)

Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.

The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens. 

Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.(12) (15)

The risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods. (12) (15)

So, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it’s not true. We just don’t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.

Do you remember when we saw the leaked video of American soldiers shooting people, then waiting for rescuers to shoot them too? 

There is one child starving to death every ten minutes in Yemen thanks to Trump **and** Obama.

We are destroying **several** Muslim countries and have nearly a thousand armed bases all over the world. We killed thousands of civilians in Mosul and Aleppo. America now bombs hospitals and schools.

Then some corporate science drone says he invented a battery that runs on elements which require the blasting of billions of tons of mineral ore, 90% of which is waste. You have to blast, crush and leach hundreds of tons of rocks to get one ton of some **magic bullet** mineral to run our **renewable** energy system. These elements will not last at prices we can afford.

This is so laughably, ridiculously stupid, it defies belief. Some people think we can just 3D print our way out of anything. Others think having goats and chickens is sustainable because there will always be enough at feed stores. 50% of South America's soy crop is shipped to China to feed their pigs. While, China ships 75% of the world's solar panels in giant ships and container trains that cause massive emissions which we ignore.

Food prices are volatile, reflecting future crop uncertainty, and we are using all our groundwater exactly where we need it. Sure we will always have water - if you're rich. We won't always have enough food. 

Our electric grid is crumbling and we pretend we will soon be running brand new smart grids. This will take decades, cost trillions, and fly in the face of rising extremes in weather. Some even have the nerve to pretend we will add the burden of electric cars for all to this non-existent grid. 

Indonesia has killed off elephants and apes in their national parks to clear cut the trees, turn them to pellets, ship them to Europe, and burn them to get 50% of their **renewable** energy. They plant palm oil trees, and then ship that oil to Europe to burn as bio-fuel in their diesel cars, then they lie about the emissions. Then they count the palm oil plantations as natural **rainforest** cover in satellite data. Their carbon tax price is so low, it pays polluters to pollute. The whole carbon trading market is run by criminal fraud. 

They tell us the tropics go first by 2025, they don't tell you that the tropics are 50% of the land on earth, they don't tell you that it is the **best** land on earth. 

What they don't tell you is that 2°C is coming to our continental interior plains 20 years ahead of the rest of the earth. This is exactly where groundwater depletion will coincide with floods and droughts to destroy our soils. This soil destruction is accelerating.

The GM food is so poisonous to us and the fields that not even bees can survive there. Our processed foods are so poisonous, they are feminizing us and the fish. They are also destroying our brain development.

The storms will soon be 5 times bigger than Katrina or Sandy. More Sandys will come because the east coast ocean is hot and the ocean south of Greenland is cold. China has a string of gigantic brand new cities next to the oceans. The sinking groundwater next oceans is dropping and being replaced with sea water. When these cities go, we will have to start industrial civilization all over again. This will be impossible by then.

If you want kids or grandkids, you are either supremely ignorant or selfish. But, I still won't blame you because it is why we are here. We **are** diversity for diversity's sake. ",conspiracy,Soy

155,"Vaccines contain many toxic ingredients – some known to cause cancer and brain damage – that have no place to go once injected into the body. So they go straight to vital organs, bypassing the body’s natural lines of defense",4.0,bwoxgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bwoxgt/vaccines_contain_many_toxic_ingredients_some/,68.0,1559656261.0,"### ALUMINUM: WHAT DOES THE SCIENCE SAY?

**It seems these days, the push to be vaccinated is everywhere, for children, for pets, for seniors, for everyone. But most people, including most doctors and nurses, have no idea what’s actually in a vaccine. And pharmaceutical companies like it that way…**

One common vaccine ingredient is the known [neurotoxin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779346) Aluminum. It’s a metal, that has no purpose in the human body, and is added to most vaccines to help [stimulate an immune response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12184362)  to the disease component in the vaccine (i.e. the virus or bacteria).  Because vaccines are injected, they bypass the body’s natural immune reaction pathway, and therefore must include an additive that is known  to be toxic to stimulate an antibody response.

### Aluminum in vaccines is linked to food allergies…

Of course, this can create problems, including a chain reaction of autoimmune traumas that create the basis for the common autoimmune health disorders and illnesses we now see in skyrocketing numbers. Because aluminum is such a powerful toxin, it actually causes the body to have an autoimmune reaction to all components within the needle, including to the animal and food-based proteins in the vaccines, which includes dairy, yeast, latex, soy, and nut. This sets the stage for [food allergies](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/evidence-that-food-proteins-in-vaccines-cause-the-development-of-foodallergies-and-its-implications-for-vaccine-policy-2329-6631-1000137.pdf), including and also to any fragments of the person’s skin, muscle, and blood that may have entered from damage by the needle.

### Aluminum has been linked to autoimmune issues…

Thus it has a [harmful effect on the central nervous system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067) and can activate an immune response. This is thought to be a factor in the [epidemic of autoimmune issues](https://www.learntherisk.org/studies), such as asthma, allergies, eczema and more. Aluminum in vaccines is  also thought to be a factor in neurological problems because it accumulates in the brain over time.

Ever wonder about the huge rise in [Alzheimer’s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21157018) and dementia-related conditions, especially as early-onset cases  skyrocket? They are neurological conditions linked to environmental  toxins in our environment — aka a load of chemicals, we subject ourselves to every day. Synthetic chemicals that are in our food, our  body care products, our water, our air…and our vaccines.

### Aluminum has been proven to cause brain damage…

Aluminum is the main toxic additive put into vaccines to elicit an immune response. It’s been shown [to cause brain damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11130287/) in animal  studies, in even tiny doses, and it accumulates in our brains so  further chemical exposure does even MORE damage. A recent [Daily Mail article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5133049/Aluminium-vaccines-cause-autism.html?fbclid=IwAR3aIYzwGiZziCX1m4OunFH42C74o9Qwlh7yBMnQUnPuMcqwYxT21BcWG4U)  published by Professor Chris Exley reveals that aluminum in jabs may  cause sufferers to have TEN TIMES more of the metal in their brain  compared to those who opted out.

>“The metal accumulates in cells that maintain a constant internal  environment and autism sufferers may have genetic changes that cause  them to hold aluminum”, according to world reknowned expert in aluminum,  Prof. Christopher Exley from Keele University (UK).” 

Aluminum is also linked to [breast cancer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013413001608), [neurological issues](https://www.learntherisk.org/studies), [autoimmune issues like lupus and IBS](https://www.learntherisk.org/studies), [sudden infant death](https://www.learntherisk.org/sids) and [autism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763) and more.

Every time we are vaccinated, our health is damaged to some degree,  whether or not it is noticeable right away. Because vaccines are  injected into muscle tissue, the aluminum takes days to weeks to leach  out into the circulatory system and accumulate in amounts high enough to  cause inflammation and the resulting issues (neurological damage,  autoimmune issues, etc).

How this damage manifests depends on a combination of previous toxic  load in the body and a person’s genetic vulnerabilities. Common chronic  issues include memory issues, Alzheimer’s, autism, speech delays, lupus,  IBD, autoimmune issues, allergies, skin issues like eczema, cancer…or  even organ failure and sudden death.

 

### Injection vs Ingestion…is there a difference?

**Injected aluminum = around 95% absorbed into body tissues**  
**Ingested aluminum = around 95%  excreted through the body’s detox pathway**

We all can handle different levels of synthetic chemicals  —  determined by our genetics — before inflammation takes hold and cause a  health issue, most often chronic. You NEVER know when you will be pushed past the tipping point of what your body can handle and develop a neurological or autoimmune issue, cancer, heart disease or even death.

All exposure adds to the toxic mix, but when it’s injected, the aluminum bypasses the body’s natural detox pathway. Around 95% of  injected toxins, including aluminum, pass from muscle tissue and go straight into the circulatory system (aka bloodstream). From there, the aluminum and other toxins can reach vital organs like the brain, heart,  kidney, liver, and others. One study shows that m[ost aluminum remains in the body for months, possibly years, after the injection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302736/). This can cause chronic health issues as the toxins raise inflammation levels in the body.

When aluminum is ingested (via food, water or air), only about 5% is absorbed into the body, whereas most if filtered through the body’s natural detox pathway. So the [toxic chemicals in vaccine](https://www.learntherisk.org/ingredients)s are  FAR MORE POTENT than those that come into the body in other ways. The toxic ingredients in vaccines include aluminum, but also mercury, barium, monosodium glutamate (MSG) formaldehyde (known to cause cancer  in humans).

The hotter it gets, the drier it gets. The drier it gets, the more we pump groundwater. Modern GM farming kills the soil so that when it floods or blows, the soil (( goes away )).

Groundwater usually replenishes around 6% of its usage rate. This is too slow. We use that groundwater to grow corn, which we burn in our cars to go to the store to buy corn and soy mass that has been chemically altered into food-like products.

We now have to use more and more fresh water to get less and less natural gas and oil. In a few years the Saudis will admit they sucked the giant wells dry, and they will have to use more water to frack the last drops from their wells.

Thailand is replacing peat bogs with palm oil plantations. The FAO is now counting palm oil plantations as wild rainforests. The rainforests are cut down, turned into pellets, shipped to Europe, and burned for ""renewable"" electricity. Those rainforests are replaced with palm oil slave plantations. The oil from those plantations is burned in German diesel cars as ""bio-fuel"". 

50% of South America's soy crop is shipped to China to feed their pigs. Much of the rest is shipped to Germany where they burn the soy oil in their cars. 

What this means is that we are using fresh water to burn corn, soy and palm oil in our cars. We are also using more water for our natural gas and tight oil. We are doing this as the great plains and rainforests dry up and blow away. These foodbaskets will die exactly when we need 50% more food. 

The climate extremes, along with water, food and energy demands will destroy civilization long before we ever see 100% renewable energy, Anyone who tells you differently is lying to you or themselves.

Two degrees Celsius is coming to the great plains 20 years ahead of schedule. It will destroy your food because we will use too much water for energy and food. We **are** burning groundwater in our cars. We are burning groundwater in our furnaces. Then we pump the poisoned wastewater under the groundwater table. We are burning water more exactly before we run out of water and food. We have doubled down on destruction. This video explains why.

By 1990 petrochemicals grew 7X the human population on earth, and would continue to 2030 sans covid.

By 2040 plastic petrochemicals would use more oil than cars even though well over a billion combustion cars would still be on the roads.

Petrochemical mineral toxins destroy the males of all vertebrate species. The effects cannot be reversed or stopped because the chemicals move up the food chain and drift north in the rain.

Many of these chemicals are poisonous to all life. It destroys the brains and sexual function of anything it touches. Nothing is immune, not even the soil and plants. Not the streams and frogs and fish and bee.

 So I’m just gonna take a stab in the dark here (towards middle-bottom are sources/quotes/and examples so everything I’m about to claim makes sense.)

I keep reading about Bill Gates currently being the largest agricultural  land owner in the United States. someone recently posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/l0sdb6/in_2013_bill_gates_and_tom_vilsack_on_data_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

And it made me realize something...

If I were a wealthy land owner I would have to think ahead, quite a lot actually, not only about myself, but also the well-being of other humans and even animals and the environment.

For the longest time the meat industry has been one of the biggest consumer corporations in grocery stores, restaurants, homes,etc. meat is a big deal. I must add, I live in a small industrial town. It has both the Koch foods kill plant and the processing plant...

I can tell you, I’ve seen more miserable crammed chickens in the tiny cages on the trucks, then I would have liked to see.

Let’s not even talk about the smell in town due to the kill plant when it gets hot...why would anyone put it in the middle of town??? Should have put the kill plant where the processing plant is, since it’s out of the way in the industrial part with the other factories. There’s a lot more things I could say about this subject, but refuse to do so openly lol...

I also have heard many, many horror stories about these places and how nasty some of that chicken is. 🤢🤮

It’s not like when it falls on the floor it gets picked up and put right back on the line...some of the meat is even green or rotten 🤷‍♀️ 

And that’s the meat everyone eats inside fast food and Tyson chicken... pretty sure that’s one of the places they have a contract with..

Did you know they hang the live chickens on hooks at the kill plant (which breaks their legs...(let’s the blood flow downward and makes it easier to “drain” them)...electrocute them, and then cut their throats let them bleed out. 

The method is known as “live-shackle slaughter”—(read more here about it on CEOs own website: https://joegrendys.com/) 

American Meat companies in 2017 produced: 

	•	26.3 billion pounds beef

	•	25.6 billion pounds pork 

	•	42.2 billion pounds chicken



That’s ALOT of animals that were killed (and wasted!!!—restaurants/at home many people “waste” the meat and throw it out...including myself...). 

If you were to put all those animals into a room for everyone to see, humans would realize their consumption levels have reach genocide status... humans are committing a holocaust againsts animals.

And don’t get me wrong...I love eating meat hahah...but it can be done in more humane ways and I think there needs to be a limit, like one cow per family or something every 6 months/per year (1cow= meat pound worth per family with x amount of members, for example... I haven’t done the math to calculate the exact amount...), so the Industry can be controlled better and not as many animals have to suffer and can be killed more humanely. 

And yes, I believe humans should eat meat, if you choose not too that’s your personal choice and that’s okay too.

My diet is mostly vegetarian, but I do love eating meat occasionally. 

My advice—SUPPORT LOCAL FARMERS AND BUTCHERS! Also stock up on cows 🐄, pigs 🐖, goats 🐐,and chickens 🐓DON’T Let the government or elites buy you out if you are a farmer! 👩‍🌾 👨‍🌾 If they try to legally get to you somehow, fight it with a lawyer or find me. Stop supporting large chains ⛓ and corporations SLAVES!!!

Meat 🥩 will be a highly sought after commodity if this “lagune/soy/peanuts—‘carbon free’ future”, we are headed towards happends. The rich will have a nice steak everyday, while everyone else eats “soy burgers” and remember you can make oil and all kinds of other stuff out of them too, but whatever... here is a fair warning ⚠️ 

Everything no matter how positively it is presented to you, hence the media, has a negative opposite result side... for example, Amazon’s pledge towards “going carbon-neutral by 2040.”

“A reaction with a delayed reaction”

That’s the shit they hide and the shit they try to “distract you from,” by the time you put all the pieces together it’s already to late...

⛓🔺⛓🔻⛓🔺⛓🔻⛓🔺⛓🔻⛓🔺

Now let’s talk about why all these elites like Bill Gates, J John Malone, Ted Turner, and even Jeff Bezos would want to own so much land, some of the reasons include oil, mining for certain minerals/elements/agriculture-food-meat-ranching/housing and businesses can be built on land/transportation (railway/road)...there are many reasons...all have one thing in common 💰💰💰!!!

So back to Bill Gates and him buying all this farm land suddenly. I believe Bill Gates along with Jeff Bezos and a few others have this idea in their heads that they are gonna attempt to overtake the meat industry by pushing their peanut soy lagumes by purchasing the majority of the land, becoming soy farmers (can be used for food replacement and even oil and many other things), and they are gonna convince the public of this idea by stating their plan on having a carbon-neutral future by 2040.  

This doesn’t even include the explanation as to why this is all suddenly happening. Thank, your lovely government and corporations who have been pushing pesticides and herbicides poisons for years. 

Crops rely on microorganisms in the soil and around their roots, to stay healthy and to grow and breathe, but poisons like the herbicides and pesticides make these microorganisms resistant...hence they have no choice, but to adapt to their toxic environment and that just happends to be theone single function they are masters at. Some of the bacteria funguses who are growing in the soil are becoming resistant and based on what I have read also have a connection (genes variants) to the COVID-19 virus. 

 You will NEVER win against them, don’t you get it? They can’t die, they simply morph. And now since theyve poisoned the land for the past 100 years, it’s having negative health effects on the humans (cancer/birth defects—bc herbicides and pesticides contain isotopes a.k.a. radioactivity...why do you think cigs are so bad... hahah that’s one of the many reasons...

...I would know better than anyone though I’m the walking cancer stick, you might as well call me Dale Gribble the chain-smoking-elite government hating-conspiracy theorist. I know all about that alien piss 🛢☢️☣️ which also includes you giving me the cure for the cancerous Tumors you have caused in my body. And if any doubt let’s test the arsenic levels in my phlegm inside my lungs I cough up everyday and don’t even begin with the lies of that’s not possible.

Then again, which such a newsworthy scoop, you might as well call me Nancy.

May I also add in that the only reason their calling it that is, bc most of these soy fields currently reside in China and in order to ship them here, it produces hella CO waste. European Union is the second largest producer, that can only mean the elite Americans are trying to keep up, but at a high cost, less access to real meat in the future and also no more forests or trees, meaning they are also the ones causing all the animal to become instinct by cutting down their habitat for their precious money-making farmland.

Always remember children 👶 Money doesn’t grown on trees!!!!

Your killing and committing genocide against the human and animal populations and it’s only a matter of time before your greedy radioactive toxins and depleting the Earths’ resources by mining all the minerals out of the Earths core  making the world unlivable...but I’m sure you’ll be on Mars by then, leaving the rest of the world it’s grave. 

FUCK THAT!!!! Get rid of your nasty ass factories why don’t you! And instead of buying all the land and also cutting down all the forests and vegetation you come across to keep up with the rising false demand your creating, so you can have more soy fields worldwide to fill your greedy pockets with more money.

Oh! btw, all your land is now mine since  apparently the Earth we all share as a home can be divided up and sold for greedy reasons. And I was under the impression the universe and Earth were very generous and let us all live here for free for millions of years.

Money is fucking WORTHLESS!!!!! Money is a curse!!! Tell me how much your worth, when there’s truly nothing left to this Earth.

An agreed upon currency you say??? Well I don’t agree with ANY type of currency that can be associated with digital or paper money. 

The one who owns the land essentially controls everything, then again the Earth belongs to Everyone, so who are you to tell me your land is private with your hypothetical principles outlined in your flawed constitution, bills, and acts.

Hello 👋 

	•	Warren Buffett (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway owns )

	•	Charles Koch (co-owner, chairman, and CEO of Koch Industries since 1967, and his late brother David Koch (deceased) served as executive vice president.) 

	•	Bill Gates (roughly 2.32 billion was donated to Gates Foundation by Buffett in 2020) 

	•	Brian Hooks (CEO and Chairman of Stand Together. President of the Charles Koch Foundation and Charles Koch Institute

	•	Joseph Grendys (CEO of Koch Foods, he bought out his former boss, Fred Koch, in 1992.)

	•	Anyone else associated

Maybe you can legally explain yourselves to me in the public eye, I’m all ears, because I’m a little bit confused about certain definitions/the stock market/ organizations/charities/corporations/finical activities and statements/laws/morals/etc...and don’t worry, I’m a nobody, with no money. All I have is knowledge and intuition and I am sure of one thing and that is if you don’t have to follow the rules, why should I???

I believe these charitable organizations, associated individuals, and corporations are committing Fraud, embezzlement, 

and misappropriation of funds against American citizens by soliciting philanthropic goals, such as seeking cures for diseases (Covid-19) or aiding the families of slain police officers (including the black lives matter) by using manipulative or deceptive manners to collect funds (donations—this includes non-taxable religious organizations).

Below explains in many quotes and examples how this would be possible...bear with me...

🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣

Here’s are some facts and  similarities between Buffet and Koch:

“Buffett and Koch have much in common. They were both born in the midst of the Great Depression, and both developed in the Midwestern heritage of industry, thrift and folksy friendliness. They also have a keen ability to make money. 

In the latest Forbes 400 Richest People in America issue, Buffett is ranked #2 and Koch is ranked #5. The only reason Charles Koch isn’t the wealthiest man in America is because he shares #5 with his younger brother, David (now deceased). Together, they are worth $82 billion, more than Bill Gates ($76 billion) and Warren Buffett ($62 billion).

Both Buffett and Koch have also taken advantage of the law of compounding. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reinvests all its profits rather than pay an annual dividend. And Koch Industries reinvests 90% of its net income each year.

But, as they say on Wall Street, “there is more than one way to climb a mountain.” Buffett and Koch differ considerably on how they made their fortunes.”

Here is some more information about Koch Industries —Charles Koch (co-owner, chairman, and CEO). Koch Industries also includes Koch Foods (chicken plant).

“Koch Industries’ Revenue Growth—

Because Koch Industries is not a publicly-traded company, some of its key financial information is not readily available to investors. However, per an SEC fact sheet, the conglomerate has, since 1960, seen its value grow at a rate 16 times greater than that of the S&P 500.

The industries under the Koch umbrella are diverse, ranging from companies that deal with energy to spandex. Koch companies manufacture paper, process minerals, create fertilizers, and refine oil. Some of the subsidiaries are also involved in ranching, commodities trading, and investing.”

(https://www.investopedia.com/insights/companies-owned-koch-brothers/)

Some vague backstory of Koch Industries...🔪🩸🤡

“Marshall turned his investment in Great Northern Oil Co. with Fred Koch during the 1950s into a 16% stake in Koch Industries, now America's second largest privately held company. When his eldest son J. Howard Marshall III sided with Bill Koch, Frederick R. Koch and other collateral family members in a failed attempt to take over Koch Industries from Charles Koch and David Koch, he purchased back company stock given previously as a gift and removed the eldest son from his estate plan. Conversely, during the same dispute, his youngest son E. Pierce Marshall sided with his father, Charles Koch and David Koch.

Marriages:
Marshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931 and divorced in 1961. They had two sons together: J. Howard Marshall III (born February 6, 1936) and E. Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 – June 20, 2006).”

This is a random quote shows how Bill Gates stepped down from Berkshire Hathaway in March 2020...right around the Covid19 crisis... coincidence? I think not. There’s always more behind the curtains...

“Acme Brick was an easy target for the conspiracy-minded. Warren Buffett's company bought the Fort Worth, Texas-based business in 2000. Bill Gates sat on the Berkshire Hathaway board until his announcement in March that he’d step down, a fact that web sleuths glommed onto. Gates is at the center of conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.”

Take particular notice in the mentioning of the word “de novo” and the quote surrounding it listed below...it’s what ultimately connects the 1% together.

“A publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies, with the target company becoming either a subsidiary or joint venture of the purchaser(s), or ceasing to exist as a separate entity, its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash, shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both. When the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a merger. Subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created de novo — this often happens in the financial sector.”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company

———————————————————

“De Novo —[Latin, Anew.] ‘of new.’

A second time; afresh. A trial or a hearing that is ordered by an appellate court that has reviewed the record of a hearing in a lower court and sent the matter back to the original court for a new trial, as if it had not been previously heard nor decided.”

https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/de+novo

“July 8, 2020 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has donated roughly $2.9 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N stock to four family charities and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the latest but not largest contribution in his plan to give away his fortune.

Four-fifths of the donations go to the Gates Foundation. The rest goes to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.”

(“In 2020, the NoVo Foundation was one of the key recipients of a $15.97 million gift of Berkshire Hathaway stock from Warren Buffett.”)

“Philanthropy, voluntary organized efforts intended for socially useful purposes. Philanthropic groups existed in the ancient civilizations of the Middle East, Greece, and Rome: an endowment supported Plato’s Academy (c. 387 BCE) for some 900 years; the Islamic waqf (religious endowment) dates to the 7th century CE; and the medieval Christian church administered trusts for benevolent purposes. 

Merchants in 17th- and 18th-century western Europe founded organizations for worthy causes. Starting in the late 19th century, large personal fortunes led to the creation of private foundations that bequeathed large gifts in support of the arts, education, medical research, public policy, social services, environmental programs, and other causes.

“Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2009 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.”

I must note Jeffery Epstein is also a self-Proclaimed philanthropist—(https://meaww.com/self-proclaimed-science-philanthropist-jeffrey-epsteins-dubios-ties-to-various-charities-revealed) 

Oh, and Bill and Melinda Gates are also noted philanthropists who are associated with billionaire investor Warren Buffett and philanthropist, Jeffery Epstein. 

“Together, Gates and Buffett established the “Giving Pledge,” a movement encouraging other billionaires to donate most of their wealth to charity either during their lifetimes or after their deaths. The Nonprofit organization pledged a significant amount of money to research and charitable causes during the coronavirus pandemic. He has given more than $50 billion to charity since 1994. However, his wealth has grown even faster than he has donated money.”

“Stand Together is an American philanthropic organization that was first established in 2003 and was often referred to informally as the Koch Network. It is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization based in Arlington, Virginia, and was founded by Charles Koch to assist philanthropic activities across the United States. Formerly known as The Seminar Network, its renaming as Stand Together was announced on May 20, 2019. The founding CEO is Brian Hooks.

In 2003, Charles Koch began hosting annual meetings of business leaders and philanthropists to support various education and policy initiatives. From these seminars grew a philanthropic community of organizations working to address issues such as poverty, addiction, recidivism, gang violence and homelessness. In 2019, this advocacy organization became the Stand Together Foundation.

Brian Hooks is the current Chairman and CEO. He previously served as executive director of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and is also president of the Charles Koch Foundation. Other leadership members include Evan Feinberg, Amy Pelletier, and Kevin Lavelle.”

In response to the 2020 George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests, board trustee and Sandler heiress Susan Sandler announced that the Sandler Foundation donated $200 million to “racial justice groups.” 

These groups were the Texas Organizing Project, New Florida Majority, New Virginia Majority, the Arizona Center for Empowerment, the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Civic Engagement Fund, PICO California, and Advance Native Political Leadership. 

Sandler explained that her goal was to facilitate change at the policy level to lift people out of oppression, basing her policy prescriptions on her belief that systemic racism is the greatest obstacle facing societal progress. 

Sandler and the executive director of the foundation, Vivian Chang, came to the conclusion that establishing power in Republican states will be the most effective way to accomplish this goal. 

One of the grant recipients, co-director of PICO California Joseph Tomás McKellar, stated that the initiative “is about building a strong constituency that can withstand the kind of storms of the moment and help us build long-term resiliency and commitment amongst a large base of people for systemic change.” Sandler chose grantees that would use the funds to advocate for Democratic-aligned policies in battleground states and create a long-term constituency that supports these issues.”

1% for the Planet members support a vast network of environmental organizations that focus on six main issue areas: climate, food, land, pollution, water and wildlife. With the clear tie between the health of our environment and the health of humanity, many 1% for the Planet approved nonprofits are working around the clock to both mitigate our environmental crisis as well as provide relief to those affected by this pandemic.

The list below outlines just some of the nonprofits in the 1% for the Planet network providing COVID-19 relief. These environmental nonprofits are on the frontlines ensuring food security for all, providing public health programs and preventing the spread of future catastrophic viruses through conservation.

In short, they are doing what they do best: providing environmental solutions to ensure that our planet and future generations thrive. 

Food security: fighting waste and feeding people. 

(Below are programs/and non-profit organizations part of “1% of the Planet—other group”)

	•	Big Green connects kids with real food through a network of Learning Gardens and food literacy programs that promote youth wellness. Understanding the importance of food security and nutrition, Big Green launched a Rapid Response Fund in response to the threat of COVID-19. “Big Green’s communities suffer from inequities in education, health and fresh food availability. For our students, COVID-19 has the potential to set them back further.

	•	Conscious Alliance prevents food waste by seeking donations from food companies that have close-to-code products, inventory mistakes, imperfect (but safe) foods and product lines going through rebranding, and then distributes that food to underserved and communities in need. “Our goal is to ensure that families have nourishment. With schools closing, kids lose access to meal programs that many rely upon. The need for our work becomes even more critical. In addition, as more people have to take off work, the population that needs our help will be expanding.” - Justin Levy, Executive Director of Conscious Alliance

	•	Food Forward fights hunger and prevents food waste by rescuing fresh surplus produce to supply those in need. In response to COVID-19, the Food Forward team has adapted their efforts to establish distribution hubs to serve community members and local hunger relief agencies.

	•	ReFED aims to create a future where food waste prevention is recognized as an untapped strategy that can save resources, create jobs, alleviate hunger, conserve water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In response to the pandemic crisis, ReFED is working with their partner organizations to ensure excess food gets to the people who need it most.

	•	Food Recovery Network unites students at colleges and universities to fight food waste and hunger by recovering perishable food that would otherwise go to waste from campus dining halls and donating it to those in need. In response to COVID-19, Food Recovery Network aimed to make it easy for businesses, schools and restaurants that are temporarily closing their doors to donate excess food to those in need via their Food Recovery Guide.

	•	EcoHealth Alliance leads cutting-edge scientific research into the critical connections between human and wildlife health and delicate ecosystems. With this science, they develop solutions that prevent pandemics and promote conservation. In short, EcoHealth Alliance isn’t just on the front lines of COVID-19 research, they’re also busy working preventing the next global pandemic. This video highlights how this organization works to protect humans and wildlife from the emergence of disease.

	•	Health in Harmony works to create community-led solutions for human health and the health of our planet. As a member of the Planetary Health Alliance, and a leader of Planetary Health in-action, Health in Harmony works with academic institutions, medical professionals, businesses and NGOs to explore innovative solutions to health and environmental challenges. Currently, they are running emergency COVID-19 relief efforts that support rainforest conservation. You can donate here.

	•	Pure Water for the World knows that safe water, sanitization and healthy hygiene practices are critical to the general health and wellbeing of all people. This organization works to provide all communities with access to safe water and proper sanitation education to sustain future generations. During COVID-19, safe water and sanitation prove paramount, which is why they’ve set up an emergency fund to bring these needs to communities around the world. Check out how their work is already impacting people in Honduras and Haiti.

In this video message, Dr. Jane Goodall explains the relationship between wildlife trafficking, conservation and zoonotic viruses like the coronavirus. Scientific research has proven time and time again that the health of humanity depends deeply on a healthy environment with diverse and thriving ecosystems. In order to prevent future pandemics, we must prevent the degradation of wildlife habitats and stop wildlife trafficking. Below are just a few wildlife nonprofits in the 1% for the Planet network that are fighting for just that:

	•	The Thin Green Line Foundation protects wildlife’s protectors: park rangers. Park rangers are vital to our planet’s ecosystems as they protect wildlife from poaching and illegal trade. That’s why the Thin Green Line Foundation works to provide park rangers with the support they need to protect threatened species around the world.

	•	The International Fund for Animal Welfare protects animals to ensure that our planet and people can thrive together. In response to COVID-19, IFAW rescue teams donated much-need N95 masks to local hospitals. However, with their conservation efforts, IFAW is also working to prevent the next great outbreak that threatens humanity.

	•	The Wildlife Conservation Society aims to conserve the world’s largest wild places in 14 priority regions, home to more than 50% of the planet’s biodiversity. As they explain below, protecting these regions and wildlife, also protects us from future outbreaks.

“WCS is on the frontlines of this issue to halt the wildlife trade and the ‘wet markets’ where animals are sold and viral outbreaks develop. WCS also remains dedicated to carrying on with our important work to save wildlife, protect nature’s strongholds and inspire people to value nature around the world. Your partnership is more important than ever.”

For all COVID-19 and conservation related news, follow the Wildlife Conservation Society’s updates.”

So, your telling me that a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization founded by Charles Koch in 2003, to assist philanthropic activities across the United States also known as ”Stand Together” or informally as the “Koch Network” also is part of/works together with other non-profit or religious organizations, including the “One Percent for the Planet” organization founded in 2002, which is how all the elites in charge of publicly and privately traded companies connect together. 

How so? By self-declaring themselves as philanthropists and associating themselves with and/or founding a non-profit organizations such as ‘Stand Together’ or ‘One percent of the Planet’, who then work together as a network of different organizations and industries (corporations), that focus on six main issue areas: climate, food, land, pollution, water and wildlife. They also note how their organization is aware of the link between the health of the environment and the health of humanity. 

These publicly-private run organizations then solicit funds from the public through advertising philanthropic goals through the media, for example, seeking cures for diseases (Covid19 and pushing public vaccination—which is NOT in the best interest of the general public considering normal long-term vaccine trials approved by FDA usually take at least between 7-15 years!) or aiding the families of slain police officers, this also includes pushing donations through Black Lives Matter Movement. This also includes the recent stimulus checks and embezzling and laundering money through the general public without them being aware bc of all the full of shit regulations that exist.

The COVID-19 vaccine is simply a highly deceptive way to solicit donations and allows them to manipulate (blackmail) people through fear into following their selfish agenda. The CEOs, philanthropists, founders, or any other elite who owns or is in charge of a corporation, industry, and/or organizations (including profit and nonprofit and religious) are the ones responsible who own these corporations that give no regard to the environment or human health.

When ordered at a strip mall Chinese takeout place, Chicken and Broccoli is always EXACTLY the same. IN EVERY SINGLE WAY. (This is based on my experience here on Long Island, where strip malls line all major roads and there's always at least one Chinese takeout place in each strip mall.) See the list below for some inarguable evidence:

1. The chicken is always cut exactly the same way - irregular slices. Never cubes, never chunks.
2. The broccoli is always slightly crisp.
3. The sauce is always a certain consistency (not too thick, not too runny), and has a very distinct taste, but not easily pinpointed as soy sauce or hoison (perhaps MSG?)
4. There are always two little carrots on top cut with a wavy texture. Not one, not three, ALWAYS TWO. 

How is it even possible that every strip mall Chinese takeout restaurant makes the SAME EXACT dish??? I'm not just talking about Chinese places in my neighborhood; this has been my experience everywhere on Long Island. Is there some kind of Chinese takeout Illuminati convention where restaurants all swear and oath to follow the same Chicken and Broccoli recipe? Do they all buy the same sauce and same frozen chicken pieces? But even then, it is always cooked in the EXACT SAME WAY. The broccoli is never overcooked and the chicken is never tough. This was a completely mind blowing realization, and after googling it to find that this discussion has never crossed the internet, I had to see what Reddit has to say.

Runaway Hothouse Mass Extinction is the most important story of young people's lives

* [Hans Joachim Schellnhuber's](https://www.ecowatch.com/researchers-predict-anomalously-warm-2018-2022-2597486954.html) research on runaway hothouse tipping points.
* Understanding what ""[tipping elements](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/danger.png?w=696)"" means is the most important thing in your life.
* MSM are trying to bury Schellnhuber's report.

**Why We Really Aren't Eco-Socialist Warriors**

The most important thing to understand is that runaway hothouse earth cannot be stopped or reversed soon after hitting 1.5 C, which means sometime in the 2030s. I am 62 so I don't give a fuck. But I imagine from the level of discourse on this sub, many here are much younger.

There are 25 billion chickens of earth. Humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinctions. China's pigs ate 50% of the soy in South America last year. Our food is killing bugs, frogs, birds, bees, fish etc. Once the mass extinction tipping point is passed, it cannot be stopped or reversed.

Surface life on earth may survive runaway hothouse and mass extinction, but it's not guaranteed.

Socialism is not required for justice, free education and healthcare, and that is why the left and right will never unite, because they both think they are superior to their opponent.

Unless we change how we think, nothing changes. If runaway hothouse and mass extinction were miraculously resolved, we would still be fighting capitalism 100 years into the future.

**Okay Zoomer**

You'll notice I said ""stop burning fossil fuels,"" liars won't say that. Instead they say ""reduce emissions"".

When Obama found out most land wind turbines only deliver 90% of their top rated power 25% of the time, he changed it to say, wind turbines deliver their average power 40% of the time, which means nothing.

Only 4% of animals on land are wild. Only 4% of global energy use is renewable.

Renewable energy will be at most 20% of global energy use by 2040.

100% energy transitions take 75 years at minimum. There has never been a 100% energy transition.

There were 4 billion hairless ape flights last year.

Electric vehicles will be less than 20% of total cars by 2040.

Humans can visit zero gravity, but they can't live there because it degrades eyes and brains.

Humans do not know how to build self-sustaining independent artificial biomes.

Me tope con los temas reptilianos,illuminati,hibridos,extraterrestres...
No pude evitar la ocasión de expresarme al respecto. Aun y cuando mi vocación exclusiva no es el activismo,ni el pronunciarme publicamente respecto a ningun tema a menos que sea a titulo recreativo.
De alli partio mi primera opinion sobre el tema 
https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6fnboj/no_son_aliens_entre_nosotroslos_aliens_somos/
y la segunda
https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6h9b8h/extraterrestres_la_nueva_ideología/
Hoy me planteo describir algunas de las reacciones que he podido percibir en estos dias.
Primeramente un absoluto mutismo en Youtube.com,y en Reddit.com...al menos perceptualmente.No hay opiniones expresas...solo como siempre sucede,la mejor manera de aislar la diferencia es invisibilizandola,acorralandola y restandole importancia.
Si, pues de alli surgieron los gettos,los barrios,las favelas...el apartheid...son areas en las cuales el sistema olvida las verdades incomodas de la sociedad.No para que ella no las vea,sino para que el poder en si no las pueda ver.Es pues como si el rey se extirpara los ojos a si mismo.
Actualmente he notado como algunas personas son incapaces de comunicarse en torno a estos temas,al menos de forma directa...porque la lógica dominante es que merecen ser tratados de segunda mano. 
No obstante he podido ver el verdadero talante de la ideologia hibrida extraterrestre.No es cierto que estos lideres sean benevolos libertadores de la humanidad frente a la opresión alienigena. 
Estas personas en general sin considerar las especificidades que se puedan presentar son lo peor que puede suceder con un organo de proceso y protección:convertirse en organos de propaganda.Que aunque no soy anti-israelita,y anti-nada en absoluto...es lo que ha sucedido con el antiguo Mossad.Por lo menos hasta hace 2 a 4 años. Solo para ejemplificar.
Por tanto la primera conducta que he podido observar es que actúan como conservadores al primer estímulo,por tanto no les compro el calificativo de investigadores,alternativos o lo que quieran.
Al primer signo de estímulo los conservadores optan por responder protegiendo su feudo...en una serie de mecanismos de defensa que en la teoría es conocida popularmente como reacción.
Se pueden apreciar diferentes tipos de advertencias simbolicas como el uso de mas calificativos,signos indicativos de rechazo o descalificación.
1.-Responden Simbólicamente,2.-Responden Territorialmente y 3.-Responden Sentimentalmente.
Es pues que la ideología hibrida extraterrestre reacciona. Es decir:responde. Ello refleja un estado de alerta,stress e intranquilidad. Por lo cual es abordable la posibilidad de que este esquema de ideas este en un declive y presente incoherencias internas. Que estén bajo ataque.
Posiblemente ello explica la aversión hacia temas que en el inconsciente colectivo aparece como tema extraterrestre,pero que en realidad se refiere a temas de exclusión: migratorios,sexuales,raciales,psiquicos,etc. 
Lo que sucede es que se ha encontrado el modo de diseminar una ideología fanática anti-inclusión sin tener que rendir cuentas a la opinión publica al respecto.Porque el fascismo ha evolucionado:ya no habla abiertamente sobre sus atrocidades,sino que las maquilla para no darse asco a si mismos,ni a los demas.
La ideología híbrida extraterrestre reacciona a la diferencia sea la que sea:sean LGBT,Afro,India,Psiquica,Islamica...todos son indeseables. 
Pero dada la gran impopularidad de las doctrinas fascistas ellos nos maquillan la realidad para que entremos en el plano lúdico del inconsciente.El inconsciente se siente parte de un juego infantil de gato (perseguidor) y ratón (victima).
Como todos los juegos duales se percata uno de la línea instrucción-obediencia,el cual corresponde al juego de roles del inconsciente. Rol Padre (amo) y rol hijo (esclavo).
Es esta dualidad la gran fragilidad de los conservadores y la razón por la cuál nunca podrán operar un cambio sino tratar de que todo siga igual o que regrese al pasado (alusiones historicas a la dominación:mitos, leyendas; pero también alusiones históricas a modelos emancipatorios previos: superioridad racial,predestinación). Esto es muy cercano al concepto de palingenesia.
No actúan directamente como una revolución,sino que responden-reaccionan como una capa privilegiada...cuidan sus parcelas/cuotas de dominación (por insignificantes que estas sean).
No pretendo hacer una exposición detallada.Sino advertir que los psiquicos no están tratando sino con personas que forman parte de un aparato político con cuadros preparados por la ideología dominante (bajos,medios y altos)...con presupuesto y objetivos muy bien delineados (aislar y someter).
He modificado mi tono,porque yo escribí primeramente conmovido en el supuesto de que yo podría tocar el corazón de estas personas...porque aparentan ser personas abiertas,desprejuiciadas,etc. Sin embargo ya han leído mi apreciación actual.
Los Psiquicos No Son Extraterrestres Por Lo Tanto No Deben Ser Deshumanizados Ni tratados Inhumanamente.No Deben Ser Descalificados Como Lagartijas, Híbridos,Etc. Que Son Tratos Crueles,Degradantes Que Atentan Contra La Persona. Los Psiquicos Tiene Igual Derecho A Propiedad,A Enamorarse Y A Formar Parte La Vida Pública.

South East Asia, Africa and South America are clear cutting forests to grow the palm and soy oil Germany needs. The cut wood is shipped to Europe, who burn it in giant furnaces to make electricity.  I don't hate Germans, most of my family are German/Irish, but I sure as hell hate Germany.

The Indonesians actually poisoned elephants and hunted orangutans in their National Wildlife Park, so they would have an excuse to cut it down, ship the wood to Europe and start palm oil plantations.

Sweden burns more newsprint than anyone else. They call it recycled energy.

Norway is building a massive $40 billion highway/bridge/tunnel project along their north coast.

The earth has already warmed +1° C, and James Hansen says that's already too dangerous. Do we listen? No, we still talk about 2° C like it has any basis in reality. The only basis in reality 2° C has is in our wishes, which unlike fishes, are still plentiful.

To stay under 1.5° C, we have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. | Claire Fyson 

To stay under 2° C, we have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 years. | Stefan Rahmstorf

So what's Europe's answer? Burn more trees of course.

Europe wants to promote burning trees for electricity as the answer to our emissions problem. 

They say tree burning emissions don't count because the trees will grow back in 50 years.

This is the very definition of insanity.

Europe wants to double its renewable energy by 2030. Sounds good right?

But 50% of Europe's renewable energy comes from burning trees.

In effect, Europe wants to double the number of trees they burn to save the planet.

Europe would have to harvest 100% more of their own trees just to meet 5% of their total energy budget.

They don't like burning their own trees, so they import them on cargo ships from all over the world.

Burning wood for electricity, and not counting the emissions, means that a mandated 5% decrease in emissions will actually become a 5-10% increase.

It's like saying a nickel is worth a dime because there's two sides to each coin.

Every 5 years or so there’s a new diet fad and all of the sudden a certain food is deadly. The funny thing is it’s always a natural food, but never meat. 

For example, a few years ago soy was considered the devil, linked to hormone imbalance. Even though there has been no concrete evidence. Gluten free exploded a few years ago and people claimed to feel better weeks after stopping eating gluten. When in reality it could be a placebo effect. Again, no concrete evidence. Look at all other countries where gluten is part of their culture like japan and yet they’re the one slimmest population in the world. Sure there are people who are gluten intolerant, just like there are people who are lactose intolerant but doesn’t mean everyone else is. 

A few years ago, paleo was the “thing” and considered the best diet, which is mostly based of meat. The fad died off and now is keto. Which again, is mostly made of meat. And discourages carbs, because “they’re bad for the body”. 

Now, what’s strange is that most of, if not all, are vegan alternatives that are now bad. This keeps people from going fully vegan. 

I feel I can go as far as saying the pharmaceutical industry is connected since meat is linked to many health problems. 

I’m not saying no food is bad. Abuse anything and there will be consequences. Drink to much water and get food poisoning.

185,Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers and Alice Glass of Crystal Castles are the same person,0.0,9x6ck7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9x6ck7/richey_edwards_of_manic_street_preachers_and/,19.0,1542244747.0,"They have almost too coincidental of a physical appearance. It's clear that either the elites are ubiquitous, including in the indie music industry, and are using duplicates of the same human shell.

Here are the lines of evidence to support this theory:

-They are the same height (5'8"")

-They exhibit a very similar physical appearance. [Here](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2018/02/GettyImages-84842799_RICHEY_MANIC_1000-920x584.jpg) is a [side by side comparison](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ao0ib1CQcmQ/SRAwkz2m76I/AAAAAAAAAno/LxwWB12HE4c/s400/Alice%20Glass%2C%20Crystal%20Castles.jpg). As you can see, they have the same jawline, the same nose, and the same overall face shape. 

-Prior to ""disappearing"" in 1995, ""Richey"" displayed very high levels of androgyny. The soy definitely got to him. There is real no evidence to suggest that, despite his androgyny, that he was gay, and may have faked a suicide to transition on a different continent.

-Alice is the most stereotypical trans girl name out there. There is [a meme](https://i.redd.it/tcdjd66vfp111.png) on 4chan's /lgbt/ board of ""Go take your pills, Alice."" whenever a ""male"" says something that indicates that they want to be a girl, or says something that sounds like they're an ""egg"" (a term used in the trans community to refer to someone who doesn't know they're trans yet). [Here are a couple](https://i.imgur.com/uO1Wt0p.png) more examples of [this name being used](https://i.imgur.com/aiKFVPr.png) 

Now here are some counterpoints some soyboy normies might try to make to ""disprove"" this theory:

-""They have a different eye color"". Yeah it's called contact lenses, dipshit.

-""Richey would be 50 if he were alive today. Alice Glass is only 30."" Yeah, and people like Marsha Stewart and Susan Sarandon (both trannies btw) also look far younger than their actual age. Doesn't mean shit here.

-""Richey Edwards was Welsh and Alice Glass is Canadian"". Voice therapy is often given to trans people so that they can sound more like their desired gender. It's not totally implausible to think that Alice, really needing to hide her past, would take on a Canadian accent during these voice therapy sessions.  ",conspiracy,Soy

""Saw your link about Vitamin C and ebola. Makes sense. We have already ratcheted up our vitamin C intake and making Liposomal.

By coating the C grains with lecithin using a cheap ultrasonic jewelry cleaner (actually we have a professional big expensive one of those, too...may come in handy), you can increase the absorption into body cells of vitamin C by 500%, thus getting useful doses before bringing on the unpleasant GI effects. This is being done by cancer patients. If you have read much about Vit C, the therapeutic doses can quickly run into double and even triple digits of grams per day. Tough to get orally.

The reason Israel promotes this is that countries with a feminized male population will be more willing to except Zionist ideas and propaganda through all the usual channels EG: Hollywood, advertising, recycling and politics. The way soy products are promoted is through the popularisation of Asian food in the west. An example of this would be ""Sushi-Sushi"" in Australia which is run by Jews, there are plenty more examples like this.

The damage has already been done to countries like Japan as one can look at the politics and the willingness of how they accept Israeli propaganda. we in the western world cannot allow this to happen, I advise you to make sure products you're consuming don't contain soy (that's if you're male) and make other people aware of the Zionist Soy racket.

188,Euthanasia,0.0,zvhwko,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/zvhwko/euthanasia/,19.0,1672040038.0,"This is what I learned from my philosophy class into a critical abstract. 

Euthanasia has positive humane and self-preservation benefits, such as planetary-sustainability by removing our 80+ over population. They take the most resources without adding much to the world (sorry grandma). 

Our medical advancements are prolonging death unnaturally and extending suffering. 
If doctors are healers and they prescribed someone with cancer medication, then they wouldn't be helping them heal. To let them heal euthanasia would be the best response. 

One's alive well being is valuable only to promoting one's alive well being. If one's being is not contributing to one's well being, then one's being alive would not be valuable. In the end the doctor isn't ending value. 

It doesn't make sense to have our youth who is responsible to recreate the new world with innovation have the burden of euthanasia and the burden of the older generations expectations. Not to mention hoarding wealth and resources.

If someone is physically ill and suffering then they should be justified to do so. If someone is checked out at 50 years old then they should be justified also. 

The immoral conclusion that academia philosophers won't acknowledge is how corruption affects a persons decision in euthanasia. 

For instance Bayer the company responsible for providing the Zkylon B chemical in the holocaust, now owns a monopoly on biotechnology agriculture. Designing seeds in labs including soy, which is sprayed with a herbicide that has glyphosate. Ultimately detected in the soy. If our food is toxic and euthanasia is promoted then this is by definition genocide. Everyone will believe it's luck of the draw or an act of God but that's not what's happening. The question can be asked how long has this been happening? 

UCSF was doing dermatology experiments on inmates back in the 60's and 70's using herbicides and recently apologized to them (how nice). 

Monsanto developed the patented glyphosate molecule back in 1970 and create their product RoundUp (you can interpret that how you like). Monsanto is now owned by Bayer. 

We can't forget Pfizer for mislabeling products for over 30 years leading to the largest settlement in a court of law with Bextra and Gabapentin. 

The opiod epidemic is on another tragic level of murdering with doctors getting corporate incentives to over-prescribe Oxycodone. 

Example was Red Wings broadcaster Ken Daniel's son, Jamie. Killed by a doctor behind a massive health care fraud. Billing insurance companies over $750 million dollars and 120 million for himself. 

""From my perspective, this isn't about fraud. It's about death and this guy's total disregard of human life,"" Daniels. 

**Conclusion**: Euthanasia is not a slippery slope. It's a cliff with how our society is structured. One day it will be needed to help the planet but we aren't even close to crossing that bridge unless it's necessary for specific circumstances.

Watch out for what they are putting in our foods, because I don't think the darkest company in history is here to liberate our unhealthy corporations food production. I certainly don't trust Bill Gates or the WEF's division of food production (WEFF).

Before i go into this rant let me start by saying i have nothing against people who support or worship andrew or tristian tate (smirk) .. but seriously don’t take offence.

My rant :
When i was a teenager i used watch videos by josh speaks or cory wayne etc to be good with women etc few years later i got into red pill it was a snowball effect i was convinced that i saw the world for what it is which is true but it was just enough. Now we have andrew tate i agree with what he says (for most part) obviously he did say some bs like cigars increases testosterone or chess burns more calories yada yada yada .. im passionate about this rant is because i have a brother who is 19 and i also saw kids from my family or friends who basically worship Andrew tate like he is some god some even wanted go university … oops my bad they wanted to go hustlers university wtf why are kids so obsessed with tate it used be one direction and hannah montana wtf just take minute to think about how a kid or teenager or a young adult would be in 2010s and compare that todays bullshit .. c’mon people still had sex still had gf still had wife still had a great life. 

To be honest the only person profiting from this ‘escape the matrix ‘ revolution is the tate brothers . Honestly bro do you wanna worship some guy who is more rich than more chad more whatever than you to build a power and fortune  off young gullible men .. you might think Im a soy boy or brokie who  is envious of the tate brothers the honest answer is yes i envy them i dont like them succeed by using gullable men like you guys.. focus on yourself dont feed them with views and. Attention believe it or not most of your online superheroes make money by using your views and attention!!

Dont blindly trust people in internet .. if all these made you upset well mate you have look yourself in mirror and ask yourself why ? Because you should be looking flaws in your own life most people connect to them because they feel like they need a father or brother figure if your father or brother don’t fit the mould then look for someone in real life instead of looking up to people like tate .

My closing thought:

Random kids are converting to islam because of andrew tate (I dont have anything against the religion I think islam preaches good morals and kindness) this is asinine this is literally kids , its their choice to believe in any religion they want but converting for tate is way too far. I hope you guys understand what i mean please dont give these guys attention and power they are filthy rich already most rich people have too much money then they crave to get power look at donald trump for example .

*John Baldwin wrote in his book “PreHistoric Nations” (1869): “****The early colonists of Babylonia were of*** ***the same race as the inhabitants of the Upper Nile.****”and* 

*Chandra Chakaberty  “A Study in Hindu Social Polity” - “based on the statuaries and steles of Babylonia,* ***the Sumerians were “of dark complexion (chocolate colour), short stature, but of sturdy frame, oval face, stout nose, straight hair, full head;*** ***they typically resembled the Dravidians, not only in cranium, but almost in all the details.****”*

[The Greeks](http://oi66.tinypic.com/zwdkz4.jpg) who very openly saw the black African ""Egyptians"" as their teachers (look up the mystery systems) also noted that the Nubians/Ethiopians (an ancient Greek reference for all black Africoid populations) were the oldest civilization from which ""Egypt"" itself came from.

The [**Qustul incense burner**](https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/images/archive/museum/nubia/QIB-Header.jpg) was the first proof of **Nubia being the oldest monarchy/dynastic civilization on Earth** as it illustrates not only the World's first writing system known as Medu Neter (incorrectly credited widely as the ""Egyptian hieroglyphs"") but also the World's first monarchy (with notation of 12 more rulers prior to the one depicted). More recent excavations in this decade have further confirmed the Nubian origins of not only ancient Kemet, but all ancient civilizations.

There is overwhelming evidence that our people had a dominate and long standing presence along the Hapi Valley from interior eastern Africa down into the Delta along the Mediterranean going back at least 100,000 years ago (shown below). Hapi Valley civilization is tens of thousands of years old. We can count at least 25,000 years according to the [**Emerald Tablets of Thot**](https://ancientexplorers.com/blogs/news/the-emerald-tablets-a-38-000-year-old-alchemist-s-guidebook-shrouded-in-mystery), but it is older according to more recent findings.The clumsy yet wide spread Western lie that our people spread about due to their false narrative of a Western African origin of the ""[Bantu Migration](https://i.postimg.cc/rFgRmZwr/Bantu-3.jpg)"" is there to mislead our people about who we are and what we have accomplished.

Western scholars have for centuries now tried to manufacture a false image of ancient Hapi Valley civilization (especially concerning Kemet) that removes our people from it.

""**A late Pleistocene-early Holocene northward migration (from Africa to the Levant and to Anatolia) of these populations has been hypothesized from skeletal data (Angel 1972, 1973; Brace 2005) and from archaeological data, as indicated by the probable Nile Valley origin of the ""Mesolithic**"" (epi-Paleolithic) Mushabi culture found in the Levant (Bar Yosef 1987). **This migration finds some support in the presence in Mediterranean populations (Sicily, Greece, southern Turkey, etc.; Patrinos et al.; Schiliro et al. 1990) of the Benin sickle cell haplotype.** This haplotype originated in West Africa and is probably associated with the spread of malaria to southern Europe through an eastern Mediterranean route (Salares et al. 2004) following the expansion of both human and mosquito populations brought about by the advent of the Neolithic transition (Hume et al 2003; Joy et al. 2003; Rich et al 1998). **This northward migration of northeastern African populations carrying sub-Saharan biological elements is concordant with the morphological homogeneity of the Natufian populations (Bocquentin 2003), which present morphological affinity with sub-Saharan populations** (Angel 1972; Brace et al. 2005). In addition, **the Neolithic revolution was assumed to arise in the late Pleistocene Natufians and subsequently spread into Anatolia and Europe (Bar-Yosef 2002), and the first Anatolian farmers, Neolithic to Bronze Age Mediterraneans and to some degree other Neolithic-Bronze Age Europeans, show morphological affinities with the Natufians** (and indirectly with sub-Saharan populations; Angel 1972; Brace et al 2005), in concordance with a process of demic diffusion accompanying the extension of the Neolithic revolution (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994).""

""Following the numerous interactions among eastern Mediterranean and Levantine populations and regions, caused by the introduction of agriculture from the Levant into Anatolia and southeastern Europe, **there was, beginning in the Bronze Age, a period of increasing interactions in the eastern Mediterranean, mainly during the Greek, Roman, and Islamic periods. These interactions resulted in the development of trading networks, military campaigns, and settler colonization. Major changes took place during this period, which may have accentuated or diluted the sub-Saharan components of earlier Anatolian populations.** The second option seems more likely, because even though the population from Sagalassos territory was interacting with northeastern African and Levantine populations \[trade relationships with Egypt (Arndt et al. 2003), involvement of thousands of mercenaries from Pisidia (Sagalassos region) in the war around 300 B.C. between the Ptolemaic kingdom (centered in Egypt) and the Seleucid kingdom (Syria/Mesopotamia/Anatolia), etc.\], the major cultural and population interactions involving the Anatolian populations since the Bronze Age occurred with the Mediterranean populations form southeastern Europe, as suggested from historical and genetic data.""

A tipping point is when something can't be stopped or reversed, like jumping off a cliff. Without data to back it up, tipping points are virtually invisible. You need the data to prove the point and if you have that data it's already too late. You won't need the data by the time you get it. Just look at the homeless people beneath your feet.

Tipping points are not in the distant future, they could be just years away. Just because you can't prove a tipping point is happening right now, doesn't mean it isn't happening right fucking now. What this means is that there is no hope, no matter what ass wipes like Michael Mann and Bill McKibben say. Whenever you see the words ""global ecological regime shift"" - run for the hills.

Nitrogen is the 3rd most important greenhouse gas. We don't have a fucking clue how much is going to blow out of the northern tundra because scientists operate from a steady state uniformity bias and they thought the tundra was too cold for mass nitrogen release, yet the Arctic is warming faster than any other place on earth.

\>>> [Nitrogen in permafrost may exert great feedbacks on climate change](https://phys.org/news/2020-06-nitrogen-permafrost-soils-exert-great.html)

Scientists are again shocked at the idea of mass methane release from Arctic soils. They didn't model this because they didn't think it could happen. It must be horrible to live in a constant state of shock.

They said it 3 years ago. Each tipping point is significant by itself, but we could already have up to 9 of 15 major tipping points already triggered.

The soy bean is the perfect food and we poisoned it. So is corn. Pretty much anything we touch turns to shit. The soy boy revolution started with a marketing campaign from the 1980s. Soy is in everything from cereals to canned tuna to shampoo, even in products that don't show soy on its ingredients label where you'll find it under aliases such as ""textured vegetable protein"" or ""lecithin"" . US rice is arsenic.

In fact soybeans are added to around 60% of  processed foods, soy is also one of the most common food allergies especially among childrenand infants and high doses of it have been linked to an increase in estrogen-responsive cancers. Nearly 2 million US citizens are allergic to it.

Google hid Monsanto bad news before the sale to Bayer, everyone knew nobody cared. Soy and corn are genetically modified to withstand the assorted poisons that kill every bug bird frog and weed for miles around. No studies are done on soil toxicity due to poisons. Normal people don't need toxic studies proving poison is poisonous.

The reason we have covid is because of animal abuse. Animals eat 80% of antibiotics. There are 25 billion chickens on earth. 4% of mammals are wild, 4% of energy is renewable, 15% of energy will be renewable by 2040, and emissions will go up 30% more no matter what because of tipping points.

The soy bean is chemical magic. It literally holds processed foods together and all kinds of things. Humans only eat 15% of the soy, the meat eats the rest because soy got wot cows want, it's got electrolytes. Soy is brain toxic. Petrochemical fluorine is brain toxic. Brain toxic means cognitive and reproductive toxic. Our food and drugs are toxic to life because of greed.

198,Veganism Is actually anabolic cannabalism and terrible for the body,0.0,ytrf66,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ytrf66/veganism_is_actually_anabolic_cannabalism_and/,15.0,1668312665.0,"Most diehard vegans have failed to come up with good retorts and instead derail discussion strawmanning using non sequiturs or ad hominem attacks. I've did deep research into this topic more than most people and realized veggies being healthy is a myth. Let's look at why vegetables are harmful:

- first let's look at plant based food in general you see all plant based foods have something called the cell wall made of rock hard cellulose. The infamous termite is one of few creatures on this planet that can properly break down cellulose and absorb nutrients from it. Most vegetables just don't break down properly with the majority just helping with shitting because of the indigestible plant matter. Corn and some grains are the most notorious of being the hardest plant matter for the human body to break down and metabolize. This is the only pro I will give vegetables there literally only good for helping you shit your brains out when constipated I like to use the phylum husk from tree bark whenever my colons clogged up and it gets things going because based on my research this non nutritious plant matter is the only good organic cellular matter that is good at taking up so much space in the body forcing muscle contractions and some types of fiber stick to your shit like an adhesive taking it along with it into the toilet. 

- so some people know about the free radical theory of aging and I started researching veggies effects on aging. It turns out the majority of plant based food actually increases aging because there rough on the body and hard to digest compared to other forms of food. The harder the body has to digest the faster mitochondria burns out in cells. The less work the body has to do to digest something the less cellular damage. This is a direct observable causal relationship. This is actually one of the factors in why caloric restriction is the only proven way to extend lifespan in any species. If the body doesn't have to expend energy digesting the food it's able to activate autophagy and clean out damaged cells properly. Cell walls by there very definition are rougher on the body then meat and flesh which doesn't have this material protection. God or if your atheist the universe evolved plant life this way for a reason meaning they weren't meant to be digested by humans. Herbivores have specialized enzymes and stomachs that can process these cell wall materials like cellulose hence termites can eat the stuff or even cows with their four stomachs.

- Broccoli contains oxalates like oclyic acid which can lead to kidney stones and it inhibits bioavailability for other nutrients directly contributing to starvation of the body

- After interviewing ex vegans I realized the reason they feel good after being on a vegan diet for a bit has zero to do with the plant matter at all. It's just the body going through it's nutrient stores once that runs out the body starts cannibalizing it self. Most Vegans are weak very pale have massive brain fog and other issues. Carnivores ironically don't have this problem you never hear about ex carnivores feeling like crap after awhile you only hear ex vegan stories. There's a reason people created the beta cuck soy boy trope and it's not just a meme there's tons of truth behind it. The YouTuber nickocado avacado is living proof because he self admits when he was a vegan he was malnourished you could even see from pics he goes from one extreme super skinny to another super fat. He's only fat because he doesn't watch his calories nothing to do with his diet much but when he was allegedly healthy he really wasn't he was starving his body.

- While this is another topic in it self hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated veg oil directly contributes to heart disease/heart attacks and not red meat carbs starches etc so many lies have been spun by the mainstream media. Hydrogenated veg oil is so bad for you it's practically criminal it's legal and can be sold in stores. It creates plaque ruptures plaque damages arteries and causes damage to all your organs over time. So where does hydrogenated veg oil come from? Plants hence the name. The only healthy hydrogenated veg oil is probably virgin olive oil and even that's contested to this day so I wouldn't take chances and just never use any of these oils. If you want to fry something just use organic plain old butter and not that fake butter most people use these days called margarine that's basically created using the same hydrogenation process and it's completely bad for you. The most common source of the stuff is so called ""0 trans fat coffee creamers"" which is a bold faced lie. The FDA allows them to market misleading labels even if they use a partial hydrogenation process which causes trans fat to appear by how the oils are split and emulsified. Even seemingly healthy brands like ""planet oat"" are extremely bad for you and I wouldn't recommend it. Most of planet oats products contains either partially or full hydrogenated oils listed in the ingredients on the nutrition label. Nestle is even facing a class action law suit for their coffee mate creamers. Almost everyone I know use these unhealthy syrups and creamers in their morning coffee and this is how these oils can enter your blood stream. The irony is trans fat was supposed to be federally banned for awhile now and to save money these companies are still able to sneak it in food products with false labels. If you use creamer use organic ones without sketchy chemicals I'm talking creamer with real milk not these fake artificial milk crap substitutes. Most mainstream creamer brands are basically sugar water mixed with oil. Another popular product that I my self unfortunately consume a good amount of that has hydrogenated vegetable oils are frozen pizza brands like red baron tombstone and digernos. Another thing I see people using is this fake butter called margarine which I mentioned a bit already. It's so popular that sometimes it's hard to find real organic butter these days like people are smothering these fake butter substitutes on their meats not realizing it's all hydrogenated oil. We're slowly killing our selves and don't even realize it but fortunately with proper research it can be avoided if you stick to home made dishes where you control the ingredients.

- Most plants have defense mechanisms in place such as poisons acids and toxins to prevent consumption. It's a talking point most of these vegan cultists dance around but the reality is humans were never meant to eat plants we were originally frugavores and carnivores that means we ate fruit and meat. Fruit contrary to popular belief is processed differently by the body then vegetables. Majority of fruit contains fructose a type of sugar where as not all vegetables have this substance. A lot of people like to throw in fruits with all plant based stuff but they contain different constituents and substances. 

- Coffee which comes from beans which means it's plant based contains caffeine which was used as a natural pesticide originally. When your drinking caffeinated coffee your basically drinking poison every day with your breakfast. It disrupts your nervous system and has neurotoxin properties. Insects die quickly but even if humans take small doses overtime it's slowly destroying your nervous system and makes you more likely to develop atrial fibrillation. Half caff or decaf is a lot more healthier since not all substances in coffee are bad some are proven to extend lifespan the issue is the caffeine cancels the benefits out.

- Soy is a notorious endocrine disruptor chemical or EDC for those that aren't aware these chemicals have the power to gender bend you or make you gay. This topic has been covered in the Ted talk ""The Toxic Baby"" and it's been tested on frogs and various other organisms and it's obviously effecting humans in similar ways too. Soy messes with estrogen production and upsets the balance allowing more estrogen to be produced in men.

- B12 can never be eaten in sufficient amounts from plant based food because it mainly comes from bacteria. Vegans tried to find a work around using duckweed but you would have to eat a large amount and it seems like a hacky way for them to win a pointless premise that means nothing in the grand scheme of things. It's just not sustainable at all and some of these vegan cultists are growing duckweed hydroponic farms just to prove people wrong.

The more I went down the rabbit hole of veggies and plant based stuff the more I realized how bad they were for you. It seems the most healthiest food on the planet based on my research is cooked fermented meat. Fermented meat is a real super food and in some cases it has Neuropsychiatric properties. I've seen reports of people gaining extreme mental clarity it's the equivalent of popping a bunch of nootropics so fermented meat has nootropic like properties. Fermented meat helps a ton with your microbiome and is nutritionally superior then any other type of meat in existence.

So you must be asking what the motive could be with these vegan cultists pushing this on people? Simple this was part of operation lockstep and United Nations agenda 2030 and the great reset, they want people eating insects and plant matter while the elites stockpile and take all the steaks and burgers for themselves. They want a society of easily indoctrinated people and a diet consuming purely plant matter does that to you.

This post is here to state the obvious of plants not to try to convince vegans to change their views. The majority of veganism is a cult and once your indoctrinated you will never leave that cult it's part of the brainwashing. The conclusion is that hey the more vegans the better more meat for the rest of the people.",conspiracy,Soy

""We report the case of a 7 month-old girl that presented with acute anemia, generalized muscular hypotonia and failure to thrive. Laboratory evaluation revealed cobalamin deficiency, due to a vegan diet of the mother.""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293883

Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966896
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552882

On paper, calcium intake is similar in vegetarians and omnivores (probably because both eat dairy products), but is much lower in vegans, who are often deficient.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139125
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/543s.full

Vegetarians and omnivores have similar levels of serum iron, but levels of ferritin—the long-term storage form of iron—are lower in vegetarians than in omnivores.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871479

Fruits and Vegetables
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344

This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988640
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet.
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason.

The exchange was about, on the surface, snacks that were going to be available during a limousine ride, the snacks included some apple slices.  The conspiracy theory that was theorized was that apples were code for drugs, and apple slices were code for  smaller amounts of drugs.  They theorized that the Clinton's were the heads of a massive drug trafficing wing.  This story gained no traction from the conspiracy theory community, and the right wing.  Shortly there after, people started talking about Pizzagate, taking exchanges from the same dump.  There is clearly a connection between Pizza gate and Qanon.  They are concerned with pretty much the same thing, a massive world wide pedophilia ring orchestrated by the people in the highest levels of government and media.  What's very interesting to me, is that the first conspiracy theory from the podesta emails, apple gate, has been completely wiped off the internet.  I should have saved those articles and blog posts i read, but i didn't.  It was so ridiculous to me that a conspiracy could be made by simple replacing one word ""apples"" with ""heroine"" or ""Cocaine"".  I thought no one would be foolish enough to fall for such a simple minded conspiracy.  I mean, who talks about committing felonies, on email, and has such a simple code? 

My theory-  all of these are made up.    Apple gate and Pizza gate have been pretty much thoroughly debunked.  There's no drug ring run by the clintons, there's no basement at commit pizza ya da ya da.  However, there are powerful people in the media, IE alex jones, Mike Cernovich, prayingmedic (on you tube) who perpetuate these conspiracy theories for their own benefit.  Alex Jones sells his brain pills, which are easily proven to be over priced soy based supplements, Cernovich and prayingmedic all earn money off their you tube pages and pateron etc.  All of these theories benefit them, whil riling up their supporters.

Most men will be sterile simps by 2060. Both food and men used to be robust in mind and body.

Poison destroys both mind and body across all classes of life. Even fungi like Phil McCrackin.

Pleading ignorance is to science what perjury traps are to the FBI. They need it to live.

Our seeds and soils are so poisoned they kill bugs, frogs, birds, bees, trees streams etc.

The plants are sprayed with poison to kill other plants, fungi, bacteria, bugs. In kill everything.

The plants have to be genetically modded to survive the poisons that kill all other life.

We use 2 of the 4 or so fertilisers plants require which make them grow big, fast and empty.

The stuff we eat is mutated to withstand the poison that kills all life, and that's before we get through chemically treating for treats that never rot because they never truly lived.

The food we eat will have genetic consequences in speed, size, breadth, width, depth beyond our reckoning.

Going against my family wishes but sticking true to my girl, I ended up getting the Moderna vaccine. Now, I do look at a lot of weird porn on the internet, mostly interracial, trans and incest porn. Whatever, I'm an American and it's my freedom to enjoy whatever I want to watch. But lately, since the vaccine I haven't felt any other symptoms aside from my inability to get it up.

Is anyone else going through the same thing too? Is it just porn addiction gone awry, and the vaccine rewired my brain to not enjoy porn anymore?

Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard green. When I tell you this story remember who's telling it. If you want to see how hard green I am, read this post from 2016.

[No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/)

When Bill McKibben wanted to name 350 dot org, he kept pestering James Hansen for the number he considered safe for CO2 concentrations, Scientists don't like hard numbers, but Bill persisted so James relented. Soon after telling Bill 350, James reconsidered and restated the safe number was 300. Bill didn't care, he already printed the stationary and t-shirts.

Bill invited James to a small protest in front of the White House for a promotional photo op.

James Hansen was promoting 100% private carbon tax dividends, where all the tax money on wealthy people would all go back to the poor. This means zero money for governments and corporations. Well guess who hates that idea? Governments and corporations, especially socialist governments.

Immediately after the photo-op, Senators Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders sponsored a bill that would allow the federal government to sequester ( steal ) 40% of any such dividends, effectively gutting Hansen's proposal. Bill McKibben, the Sierra Club, the WWF are all frauds who act as front men for corporations exactly the way TreeHugger works for the logging industry. Europe gets over 50% of its renewable energy burning trees imported from around the world on cargo ships. They are shipped in the form of pellets, so they can ship them cheaper. Cars in Europe burn diesel fuel and 8% of that fuel is made with palm and soy oils. Soy oil is brain toxic.

James Hansen's proposal is 10 years old and emissions went up 10%.

We got 10 years to reduce emissions 55% or face hunger, war, thirst and runaway hothouse mass extinction. This is our last chance to do the right thing. 100% private carbon wealth tax dividends will unite the left and right against the rich and reduce emissions faster than any other way. People on the left, like Bill, have been fighting this idea for over 10 years. If you are young, your idealism is being used by NGOs and corporations against your best interest in exactly the same way Trump uses his base. Most of you are too young, stupid or pig headed to see this, which is normal.

The people who stood silently while televisions ads told you that oxy wasn't addictive, are the same people who say they'll save us from the covid. This are the same people who said that recycling plastic would save the earth, and that 911 was done by the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan.

If we don't get our shit together and speak with one voice it's over. Bernie Sanders and Trump won't fix anything. Bernie is a sell out traitor and Trump is a lying sack of shit. If Bernie is not a traitor, then why is he fighting for the Democratic Party and not you?

Magnetite is a particularly concerning pollutant because it forms destructive chemicals called reactive oxygen species, ( free radicals ) which lead to damage and inflammation.

Monogamous relationships can be observed in nature and many times they are observed in the species with extremely high ""intelligence"" for example, swans, grey wolves, and gibbon apes. Animals with low intelligence such as fish, and cattle mate promiscuously. 

There definitely is an evolutionary advantage to mating for life. If an individual wants to secure success for their genetic material they will first select a compatible mate, one that will be a good compliment to their own genes. Then they will want to mate, but the natural world is dangerous and full of strife. That's when seasonal mating comes into play. Having more offspring means that more of your genetic material will spread. One might argue that if a alpha male mates with 20 females much more of their genetic material will spread, this is true but the ""apha"" genes are dominating the male expression and the ratio of male to female genetic transmission shifts drastically. This can cause some problems in the behavioral expression of proceeding generations.

In modern slut culture that progressive society has brought us it is popular to be promiscuous. But, many men in this society are alienated like the beta bulls in any herd they will never pass on their genetic material. In a promiscuous society hookup culture dominates and traditional relationships are replaced. This actually leads to far fewer men having sex on average compared to the 1940's when 80% were married by 22. We have become like a fenced in herd of cattle. One alpha asserts dominance and bangs the majority of the females. This process favors one type of genetic material over another. Maybe that is why we are seeing a rise in ""toxic"" masculinity? Slut culture favors the breeding of the assertive alpha over the more average man. The decline of marriage coincides with the rise of toxic masculinity, rape, and patriarchy because in slut culture the average man has been out competed by alpha male. Now single mothers raise the children of a father who has moved on. Much like the captive bull. The fence provides safety for his offspring so that he does not have to. He can move on and breed then eat rather than protecting the herd.

Low testosterone is rampant in western man. Having sex actually makes your body produce testosterone. Whereas masturbation saps testosterone and stifles the production of testosterone. The men who have sex have higher T. And the men who are weak and effeminate stay soy boys because their body's are not primed for producing testosterone. Yes lifting is important. But the endorphins and hormones realised during sex are much more important to self actualization. Tests have shown that population density has a correlation with sexual orientation. A study showed that as a rat pit filled with breeding rats would display a higher ratio of homosexual activity as the population grew. The scientist concluded that the genes were identifying a possible lack of sustainable food and possibly triggered a gene responce to increase the rate of homosexual rats so that the population would be able to live within the food provided by the environment. Here is where we get to agenda 21 and the rise of urban man. Alex Jones would have us believe that homosexuality is caused by chemicals in the water, plastics, and soy, this may be a cuase of the feminization of men but not the increase in homosexuals. Feminine and weak mean =! Homosexual. The vast majority of homosexual men are in fact quite alpha. It is the vocal femme few we see elevated to the image of ""gay"" man. But that is besides the current point. It is the massive populations in cities that is the cause of a higher rate of homosexual men. The human genome is reacting to what it sees as a threat to its future existence. What can we conclude form this? Lifestyle and cites themselves have an effect on gene expression.

Finally this is where we get to sexually transmitted diseases. What was the origin of a sexually transmitted disease? It is like any other entity, it has no clear origin. It logically does not follow that a population without such diseases, I.e. primitive man, would develop them through sexual intercourse alone. Maybe these diseases began as something else and found a evolutionary niche in the moist tissue of mammalian sexual organs. Sexually transmitted diseases can only exist in a culture of promiscuity. If every person mated for life the only stds would be from rape or a promiscuous underclass that went around the hypothetical societal norm. In this way a monogamous lifestyle can be seen as far healthier for the physical body and for society as a whole. Could we argue that promiscuity was demonized not because of prude religious morals but because the ancients knew the dangers of such behavior to a society's collective gnome.

A monogamous relationship is not only psychology healthier, I.e. it aides in the production of oxytocin and other hormones, it is healthier in general. For yourself and for society, find someone and love them. Love them good. And love them for a lifetime. If we fall in to the trap of promiscuous sex we will collectively destroy modern medicine and the effectiveness of antibiotics. If we want our society to last past this Weimar phase of degeneracy we must return to imitation of the other high predators in nature. We must secure a healthy society through long lasting healthy monogamous relationships. We can end sexually transmitted diseases in one generation if every virgin picked one virgin to be with for life.

I also imagine the farm lobby ought to be able to extract more subsidies for farmers in total if they made it seem like a healthier and more environmentally sustainable (i.e. less meat production and more plant production) system.  Is ethanol and the corn farmers working with the energy lobby a stronger stick to wield?  Could that change now that oil prices are very low?

Please, CA voters! Vote Yes on Prop 37. Prop 37 is a measure that would require products containing genetically modified foods to be labeled.

Most food in the US contains genetically modified crops, due to the heavy saturation of cheap genetically modified soy and corn on the market. Not only do these crops have questionable genetics (some are bred to contain certain toxins in order to resist insects) and being sprayed with pesticides/chemicals that get passed on to the consumer, those same chemicals sink into the soil, and future crops are exposed. 

With cancer and other serious health problems remaining relevant in our society, I think labeling genetically modified foods will not only allow us to be more selective of the things we eat, but it will prompt people who aren't aware of these GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) to learn more about their health and food safety. 30 years ago, you probably could walk up to most people and ask them what a vegetarian was, and they wouldn't have an answer. These days, almost everyone knows that a vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat meat. Additionally, there are many more vegetarian/vegan options in stores, along with growing health food stores that are becoming more prominent. Why is that? Because of a slowly building awareness to importance of diet in relation to health. These labels will continue the awareness, and hopefully will set an example for other states, and allow for an even healthier food selection and standard for future generations. 

Even if you're not voting, please tell your friends, parents, and use social networking to get the word out on prop 37! Monsanto, a large corporation that creates genetically modified crops in addition to creating the pesticides used on them, is dumping a LOT of money into the ""No on 37"" campaign. This is because voting yes would cut into their multi-billion-dollar business. That's why I wanted to create this thread, in hopes that the power of social networking is stronger than these big industry figures who only care about the health of their wallets.

Thank you for reading! Hopefully one day everyone will be able to exercise the right to know what's in their food! 

Pledge: I'd appreciate any pledge to vote yes, tell a friend, post on a social network, upvote, or any combination of those!

Many would say it is their personal freedom to be that way. However, how does one change when organic and green foods are so expensive, while fatty and preservative-laden foods are so cheap and easily available?

I have a hard time showing sympathy towards most overweight/obese individuals because it is a choice of lifestyle and diet (and is rarely due to an uncontrollable disease in which case, they are excused). Myself being a supporter of Socialism, I would have to say that controlling the prices of such things as food and produce is key here. Yes, it is ones freedom to eat and live as they wish. However, when they consume far more (per person) than others do (per family), spend more for medical treatments, and (in affect) use more gasoline than the average citizen (due to the weight the car is carrying) that is when it should be controlled. 

Firstly I propose that unhealthy foods (anything with a high amount of preservatives, fats, or sodium) should be taxed just as cigarettes are. Foods such as Mountain Dew, Twinkies, and potato chips have next to none nutritional value to them and, therefore, should be price higher as they are more of a luxury than a necessity. Healthy foods, however, such as granola, soy, and organic foods should be made cheaper and more accessible to public consumption as they do tend to have the ingredients/vitamins/minerals in them that the human body is so desperately in need of. Mountain Dew should be replaced with Organic Green Tea. Twinkies should be replaced with Clif Bars. And potato chips should be replaced with raw, organic fruits and vegetables. All these alternatives should be priced far lower than the (now) primary source of ""nutrition."" 

Healthy foods, however, would not be cheapened enough for the already obese people to gorge on them instead of the unhealthy foods. Therefore, there would be a moderate price drop on Organic and healthy, and a major inflation on unhealthy, potentially dangerous (if consumed over a long period of time) foods. This way, consumption would not only be limited, but cut back. 

Unfortunately this would then lead to the individual's amount of self-control, which is getting into psychology. Mind-control isn't yet an option. So let's just stick to the government controlling the diet.",politics,Soy

40,"Why I do not condemn the ""Walmart flashrob""",0.0,wsq1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wsq1x/why_i_do_not_condemn_the_walmart_flashrob/,5.0,1342667016.0,"For those unaware of what happened, the story is as following: [A mob of 300 black youth entered a Walmart after a party nearby, stealing stuff and breaking things.](http://rt.com/usa/news/teenagers-walmart-store-florida-502/) The main purpose of their rampage appears to have been to cause chaos. 

To understand why I do not condemn such behaviour, we first have to look at why others *do* condemn this type of behaviour. It is generally taken as self-evident that this behaviour is horrendous, and hence people take no real effort to defend it. The argument revolves around the fact that the teenagers have used violence against a corporation and its employees, for no other purpose than their own pleasure.

To be more specific, the teenagers used physical violence, which is the most direct form of violence. Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation"".
 
The first thing that needs to be made clear is that violence is used against us everyday. A lot of this violence is done against us in the name of government, which is supposed to reflect the collective will of our society as a whole. It is hence assumed that such violence is justified, because although it may inflict harm on a minority of people, the majority has come to the conclusion that such violence is necessary because it provides a net benefit to us all.

Sometimes violence is used against us because we used violence ourselves, and hence society feels a need to protect itself against us. Examples include imprisonment for rape or murder. Other acts of violence are done against us, because the damage done to us is seen as little in comparison to the benefits it provides to others. As an example, I happen to live next to a highway. It is estimated that me and my neighbours inhale the equivalent of 12 cigarettes per day, merely from the pollution. Children are born with a lower IQ and a reduced life expectancy and quality of life as a result. However, the highway will remain here until my death, because society as a whole has decided that our suffering does not exceed the benefit of the tens of thousands of people who use the highway everyday to get to work.

The government of Brazil will use a similar argument in its plan to deport thousands of indigenous Americans to construct a dam on a river. The value of the cheap electricity provided to society as a whole is seen as exceeding the suffering inflicted on these indigenous people who live happily without electricity. My point here is not to argue against highways or dams. It is to make clear that nearly any action we take inflicts violence on others. From the car we drive that drowns an island in the Pacific ocean, to the meat you eat from a cow murdered after eating soy grown on farmland that once contained a bit of rainforest.

We engage in violence every day, and we used it to build the society we live in today. In the same way that Brazil deports natives today, we once deported natives of Australia who sustained a lower population density than whites could through agriculture. And when we did, we could justify it through the same logic: ""Does the benefit of a thousand people not exceed the violence inflicted on a dozen?""

What differs the violence we saw on this video here is that it is an act of *unauthorized violence*. We condemn it not so much because it is a form of violence, but because it was taken by these people's own initiative. Furthermore, we see it as non-constructive violence. Violence can be constructive. Despite being unauthorized, most of us do not condemn parents who murder people that raped their children, because we see not just an act of justice, but an act of empowerment by the individual. Similarly, we see most violence done in the name of government and business as constructive. As a society we accept the price that such violence carries, namely, the disempowerment of the individual and the tribe, because in exchange for sacrificing power, we are taken care of by the collective.

We generally do not mourn the local grocer forced to close shop because he is unable to compete with the Walton family's low prices, we accept it as part of the way our economy works. Everyone must obey the laws of the economy, which operates according to a sort of survival of the fittest mechanism with its own internal rules and dynamics. If our business is slightly less profitable than a competitor we have to accept assimilation (being bought out by the competitor) or genocide (competition until we reach bankruptcy).

We do not condemn such economic violence, because it is required for our society to operate at its maximum efficiency. If every little mom and pop store was kept open, we would still spend an afternoon going from stand to stand buying meat and various vegetables from various farmers each bringing their own product to the market, as is common in many undeveloped countries. In addition, we would spend a larger portion of our income on food. Hence we accept economic violence, namely, the elimination of a person's autonomy through the dissolution of his business.

Now the fact that indirect violence such as economic violence is allowed, while direct physical violence is forbidden has certain effects. For example, it shifts power from the physically strong to the intelligent. An intelligent man has a better chance of growing up in the Information age as a millionaire through a good business plan than a strong man. Whether intelligence alone is enough to be successful in this age is beside the discussion, but intelligence works to gather enough capital to gain power in our world. Turn your million into a billion, and you can influence elections, hire bodyguards, private armies, spies or even assassins if you feel like it.

Most of us do not have such power. We lack the family background, the intelligence, the good looks, the social skills, or other abilities required to gain power of our own in a world that disavows direct physical violence in favour of indirect violence. In reality, most of us have power taken away from us. Technology allows centralization of control, which in practice tends to mean that power is transferred from persons and families to structures and organizations. In fact, we condemn people who seek to use membership of such structures to gain personal power, with phrases such as ""policy brutality"" and ""white collar crime"".

In exchange for our sacrifice of personal power we are now given simulations in which we can gain power. In Grand Theft Auto we can use physical violence to gain power over other people. We can hold guns against their faces, throw them from bridges or drive over them with cars. To most of us, the actual goals within the games are secondary to the illusion of power gained when committing such random acts of violence. To those of us more attracted to the idea of indirect power, simulations are available allowing us to run businesses and even entire governments if we feel like it.

In exchange for access to such simulated direct power,we increase the real indirect power of the growing corporations that deliver such simulations to our screens. In addition, simulation always implies an inferior imitation of the original. Nobody would argue that people should forego sex, and be satisfied with the simulated intercourse of masturbation. We rightly recognize sex as part of the human experience, and essential to most for a satisfying life. Yet, strangely enough, we do not talk about the desire for power. We refuse to acknowledge its existence. The reason for this is because power can not be gained without breaking the laws and norms of our society. We have accepted that everyone sacrifices his power for the greater good, and at an individual level, we accept that we sacrifice our power in exchange for being taken care of and given access to electronic devices which give us pleasure.

And yet, a few days ago, a group of black youth decided after a party, likely intoxicated, to break a lifetime of social conditioning in school, and seek to fulfil their drive for power by invading a giant store, owned by the richest family in the country and breaking and smashing everything they could find. Violating social norms, and getting away with it through their strength in numbers. Youth who are likely to grow up to work in one of these giant stores if they are lucky, filling shelves until they die, because they have no other choice.

They are condemned by people who believe that their intelligence provides them with a better path to power. Cubicle concubines who believe that one day, after enough promotions, or a genius invention, they will be on the other side of the office, telling people to stay another Saturday, stop showing up late, or bring them a cup of Starbucks coffee. People who believe that in exchange for being docile, they will one day be given economic power: The ability to threaten people with termination of their contract if they do not obey their petty orders.

I do not condemn these youth. I congratulate them on their victory, and wish to see every domesticated cubicle drone follow in their footsteps.",politics,Soy

Argentina’s high standards of living attracted [massive flows](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1865404?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) of immigrants, and Buenos Aires culture and sophistication earned it the [title ](https://www.goaheadtours.com/travel-blog/articles/what-makes-buenos-aires-the-paris-of-south-america)the Paris of Latin America. However, since its early 20th century peak, Argentina’s economy has suffered a series of booms and busts due to its dependence upon the export of agricultural commodities. Since the rise of Juan Peron in the post-war period, these cycles have been exacerbated by populist economic policies. The IMF has been forced to bailout Argentina 21 times, and a detailed history of the ups and downs of Argentina’s economy would require far more space than I have here. Instead, I want to focus on Argentina’s most recent boom and bust cycle. I will discuss the populist policies of Cristina Fernandez, Mauricio Macri’s attempts to clean up the resulting mess, and the economic nightmare faced by the current government of Alberto Fernandez.

**Cristina Fernandez Takes The Populist Road**  
Cristina Fernandez assumed the presidency of Argentina in [2007](http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2012_07.htm), replacing her husband Nestor Kirchner, in a bid for the family to circumvent term limits. Although Nestor Kirchner had railed against the IMF and neoliberalism, and followed a heterodox economic policy, Cristina Fernandez’s 8 years in office marked an [intensification ](http://143.107.92.173/ccpeae/minicursos/2019/Textos%20Minicurso%20Onda%20Rosa%20USP/Damill-2015-Macroeconomic%20Policy%20in%20Argentina.pdf)of populism in Argentina. Between 2007 and 2015, welfare expenditures increased welfare payments 1.7 fold in real terms, and utility subsidies amounted to 5% of GDP. Cristina Fernandez [inherited ](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/government-budget)a modest budget surplus, but by the end of her presidency the budget deficit was 5% of GDP. Argentina under the Kirchners had taken a hostile stance towards international creditors, and so could on finance the budget deficit by printing money.

The inevitable consequence was high levels of inflation, with inflation reaching 25% by 2015. High inflation rates, combined with a fixed exchange rate led to a heavily overvalued currency putting Argentine manufacturers at a [disadvantage](https://www.courant.com/sdut-winners-and-losers-of-argentine-currency-2015dec17-story.html). The government responded with a system of tariffs and subsidies to keep Argentine manufacturers afloat. The most absurd example of this is the heavy tariffs Argentina on electronics that made most consumer electronics prohibitively [expensive](https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/07/news/economy/argentina-iphone-tariffs-trump/). Some domestic manufacturing thrived, with Blackberry [building ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-economy-manufacturing-analy/end-of-the-world-factories-struggle-to-adapt-to-macris-argentina-idUSKCN1B40BG)a factory in Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America. While there were some winners from this policy of populism, the costs were much higher than the benefits.

The government of Argentina was forced to take increasingly drastic steps to raise revenue. The government [nationalized ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-ypf/argentina-nationalizes-oil-company-ypf-idUSBRE8421GV20120504)the oil industry, and the $30 billion pension industry. The government tried to keep people from knowing how dire the situation by publishing [fake ](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/inflation-lies/)inflation statistics, using the courts to harass the [opposition ](https://www.cjr.org/reports/allout_media_war.php)supporting media, and attempting to quash [corruption ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/argentina-reject-interference-judicial-independence)investigations by the judiciary. Argentine growth was strong so long as soy and wheat prices were high, but agricultural commodity prices stagnated from 2012 onwards. The populist policies ceased to be sustainable under less favorable conditions, and Argentina saw per capita income increase from 2012 onwards. Ordinary Argentinians, angry with the state of their economy, chose to elect Mauricio Macri to power.

**Mauricio Macri Fails to Get the Job Done**  
Mauricio Macri, a moderate candidate who recognized how toxic the IMF was in Argentina, aimed to stabilize the economy of Argentina by first pursuing [popular ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/lessons-learned-from-the-argentine-economy-under-macri/)economic liberalization to build the political capital necessary for more painful reforms. Investors cheered symbolic steps such as the publishing of [accurate ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/05/25/argentinas-new-honest-inflation-statistics)inflation statistics. The government cut tariffs, liberalized [capital controls](https://www.ft.com/content/556d51b4-a447-11e5-873f-68411a84f346), and cut [export taxes](https://apnews.com/e7cf20fd438b4a6082226a0a98837f30). The liberalizing policies bore important fruit, including [attracting ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-investment/argentina-expects-14-billion-in-investment-on-fruits-of-reforms-idUSKBN17D2SU)$14 billion in FDI . Moreover, Macri’s crackdown on corruption resulted in dramatic reductions in the cost of building [infrastructure](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/yes-macri-failed-on-the-economy-but-it-wasnt-all-for-naught/). While some unpopular policies were pursued, including [steep reductions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentinas-cut-to-electricity-subsidies-will-raise-rates-in-buenos-aires-1453939799) to utility subsidies, the net result was the budget deficit steadily increased to 6.1% of GDP by 2017.

The Macri government’s [ability ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-bonds-bids/argentina-returns-to-global-debt-markets-after-15-years-idUSKCN0XG2W0)to borrow from international capital markets made these large deficits manageable, as the government did not need to print money to keep the lights on. However, long term economic sustainability demanded Macri reduce this deficit and many investors were nervous about the worsening debt situation. One of the key promises Macri made an independent central bank, which tried to impose a strict inflation targeting to keep inflation under control. However Macri wanted greater macroeconomic flexibility, and tried to push the central bank to push for a higher inflation target, undermining the central banks independence. Global financial markets panicked at this misstep, and combined with rising US interest rates and a major drought, caused a [sudden stop](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6982/1/MPRA_paper_6982.pdf). Investors pulled massive amounts of money out of Argentina [causing ](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03sRB25wdG38KjFi0O9f3xBJTKsLg%3A1608176126274&ei=_tHaX8KlEIOa5gLDwZnAAg&q=usd+to+argentine+peso&oq=usd+to+argentine+peso&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIMCAAQyQMQQxBGEIICMgIIADIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgkIABBDEEYQggI6DQgAELEDEIMBEBQQhwI6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BwgAELEDEEM6BQgAELEDOgQIABAKOgUIIRCgAToMCAAQyQMQDRBGEIICOgQIABANOgYIABANEB46CAgAEA0QBRAeUOVRWO1wYIdzaAZwAngAgAFkiAHoDZIBBDIzLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEMwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjCnPj1itTtAhUDjVkKHcNgBigQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)the exchange rate to collapse from 20 Argentine Pesos to the Dollar to 40 Pesos to the dollar with little warning.

Argentina found itself in a nightmarish political economy situation. If Mauricio Macri failed to raise taxes and cut spending, the currency would collapse and inflation soar because the budget deficit was too high. The government as a result was forced to implement [austerity ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-economy/argentine-markets-hold-steady-as-anti-macri-protesters-decry-austerity-rising-poverty-idUSKCN1VP1T1)measures. However, these same measures were deeply unpopular, making it more likely left wing populists would come to power, causing financial markets to panic and sink the economy further. The IMF attempted to take an accommodating stance towards Argentina, offering Argentina a [$57](https://www.ft.com/content/5cfe7c34-ca48-11e9-a1f4-3669401ba76f) billion bailout, the largest ever. However, the IMF’s bailout only postponed necessary reforms, associated Macri with the IMF which is hated by many Argentine voters, and failed to quell investor panic. Inflation soared to [over 50%](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi) and per capita income fell by 5%. Unsurprisingly, in the 2019 general elections, Argentine voters turned against Macri and returned the populist left to power.

**No Solutions to the Left** **Either**  
In Argentina’s 2019 elections, Alberto Fernandez (no relation to Cristina Fernandez) [narrowly ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/12/12/how-alberto-fernandez-plans-to-cope-with-argentinas-economic-crisis)won against Mauricio Macri. The Justicialist Party chose to have Alberto Fernandez lead the ticket, as he was a far less polarizing figure than Cristina Fernandez. However, Cristina Fernandez ran as his running mate and it has never been clear where real political authority lay. From the very beginning, Alberto Fernandez’s presidency was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Argentine government reacted with [alacrity ](https://www.wired.com/story/how-argentinas-strict-covid-19-lockdown-saved-lives/)at the beginning of the pandemic, and Argentina was hit much less hard by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries. Moreover, the reprieve was only temporary and COVID-19 eventually hit Argentina with the same [gale force](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/17507/covid-19-argentina-successful-initial-lock-down-top-ten-most-affected) it hit other parts of Latin America. More than [41,000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) people have died so far, more deaths per capita than any country in Latin America other than Peru.

The lockdown measures and global economic crisis resulting from COVID-19 have proven to be immensely costly to Argentina’s struggling economy. The IMF is currently projecting Argentina’s economy to [collapse ](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO)by 12%. While global [wheat ](https://www.macrotrends.net/2534/wheat-prices-historical-chart-data)and [soy ](https://www.macrotrends.net/2531/soybean-prices-historical-chart-data)prices have grown through the current crisis, providing cushion to the Argentine economy, international capital markets have reacted to rising instability by [pulling ](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2020/november/sudden-stops-and-covid-19-lessons-from-mexico/)massive amounts of money out of risky emerging markets like Argentina. The government of Alberto Fernandez has had some success in renegotiating [$65 billion](https://www.dw.com/en/argentinas-debt-restructuring-deal-explained/a-54432373#:~:text=Argentina%20owes%20a%20fortune%20%E2%80%94%20%24323,mess%20go%20back%20several%20decades.) of debt with private creditors. Moreover, the government hasp provided [generous ](https://ww1.issa.int/news/social-security-responses-covid-19-case-argentina)social security supports to help ordinary Argentinians get through the crisis. However, the result is a budget deficit soaring to [6%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-argentina-fiscal-a/argentinas-hard-won-fiscal-progress-knocked-back-by-virus-idUSKBN2425HW) of GDP, that the government has been forced to finance by printing money. Monthly inflation rates are consistently over[ 3%](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/12th-december-19th-december-what-we-learned-this-week.phtml).

The government has tried a variety of measures to contain the crisis. However, the [capital control](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/government-struggles-to-stop-precious-dollars-draining-away.phtml) it has imposed have widely been circumvented. The government has moved to [nationalize ](https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/resistance-grows-to-argentina-s-plan-to-nationalize-soy-giant)failing firms, only to be blocked by the courts. Argentina [raised ](https://theconversation.com/argentina-is-trying-to-tax-its-way-out-of-another-financial-crisis-why-thats-so-risky-137839)export taxes to close the deficit, but cut them after exporters reduced grain deliveries. The government has imposed a [3.5%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55199058#:~:text=Argentina%20has%20passed%20a%20new,amid%20the%20ongoing%20coronavirus%20pandemic.&text=Those%20affected%20will%20pay%20a,on%20that%20outside%20the%20country.) wealth tax, yet wealthy Argentinians are increasingly choosing to depart the country altogether, with [countries ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/09/26/why-argentines-are-flocking-to-uruguay)such as Uruguay offering Argentines incentives for leaving. Entire industries are choosing to depart from Argentina, with companies ranging from software companies to car manufacturers choosing to [uproot ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/companies-are-leaving-argentina-and-it-s-not-pandemic-s-fault)their businesses entirely.

Argentina’s current woes are part of a broader pattern of boom and even deeper bust. Argentina finds itself locked into persistent cycles of large government deficits, currency crises and populist government. The current presidency of Alberto Ferndandez is increasingly unpopular, with the current administration’s approval rating falling to [35%](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/10/17/argentine-president-confident-in-the-ruling-coalition-unity-to-face-challenges-despite-signs-of-rifts). It’s likely the next government will inherit the same set of dynamics, and given this next government will have the same set of tools and incentives it is difficult to see how it will perform better. Nevertheless, Argentina will need to find a way to break out of this cycle if it wants to leave economic stagnation behind and see sustained development.

So far this year there have been [over ](http://latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-28/brazil-planes-chile-fight-amazon-fires)83,000 fires in Brazil, a 77% increase from the same time last year with a majority of the fires in the Amazon region. The upsurge in fire and deforestation could have a dramatic impact on global warming, as the Amazon rain forest acts as one of the most important carbon sinks in the planet. By some estimates, deforestation has resulted in [one billion](http://carbonbrief.org/amazon-rainforest-is-taking-up-a-third-less-carbon-than-a-decade-ago) tons less carbon being sequestrated than a decade earlier, and the current fires will only accelerate this trend. The nightmare scenario for the Amazon is fears that since the Amazon [generates ](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/trees-amazon-make-their-own-rain)much of its own rainfall, massive deforestation may create an almost impossible cycle of reduced rainfall, mass tree die offs, and uncontrollable fires that could [destroy ](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/08/01/the-amazon-is-approaching-an-irreversible-tipping-point)the viability of the Amazon as an ecosystem.

The recent upsurge is environmental damage to the Amazon is especially disheartening given that Brazil made major progress between 2004 and 2012 to dramatically [reduce ](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-07-03/how-brazil-has-dramatically-reduced-tropical-deforestation/)levels of deforestation and fires. A combination of intensified [enforcement ](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/world/americas/19brazil.html)of environmental laws, pressure from civil society groups, and [voluntary ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837717312413)efforts by soy and beef producers, resulted in deforestation rates falling by more than 70%. At the same time, the global recession and the resulting collapse in [commodity prices](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/soybean.aspx) seriously dented demand for Brazilian soy and beef. Although the relationship [between ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/27/how-beef-demand-is-accelerating-amazons-deforestation-climate-peril/?noredirect=on)beef and deforestation is universally accepted, the relationship between soy and deforestation is [more ](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/4/1341.full.pdf)contested. The overwhelming majority of soy is grown is grown in the [cerrado](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/brazil-deforestation/), a region of grasslands south of the Amazon. However, many argue that increased acreage for soy in the cerrado has [displaced ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024010/pdf)ranchers to the Amazon.

Worse, in 2018, Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil. His administration has aggressively promoted the development of the Amazon. [Bolsonaro ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/brazil-logging/)has placed the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of determining protected indigenous lands, and fired [large ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/brazil-logging/)numbers of civil servants in Brazil's environmental agencies. Moreover, Bolsonaro's incendiary language makes it clear that environmental law breakers should expect little more than slaps on the wrist for their actions. International pressure has finally forced Bolsonaro to take steps [against](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/world/americas/brazil-military-amazon-fire.html) the fires, but it is clear his government has only limited interest in doing so. In principle, the entire planet would be made better off if wealthy nations were able to spend the tens of billions necessary to properly incentivize developing countries to protect their environments, but the political will to do so seems lacking. The current explosion of fires is only one environmental crisis related the changing land use patterns.
