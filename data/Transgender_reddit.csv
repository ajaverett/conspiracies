Hi. I've never been much of a conspiracy theorist, but after thinking about things that happened to me a few years ago, I think I may have nearly been taken advantage of by nefarious actions from the pharmaceutical  industry. I really want to get the word out, and find other people with similar experiences, and this sub seems like a good place to start.



I went to a very stereotypical high school, with all the standard cliques and shit you would expect. I was, and still am, not a very masculine person and because of this I didn't fit in. I was far more intrested in music, fashion, anime and film than sports or ""getting pussy"", which made me an outcast. As a result, I struggled with self esteem issues, and generally was confused and annoyed for most of this time. Then, when I was 17, I found something that made my life make sense: transgender forums. These websites told me that my feelings were classic transgender feelings, and that I needed treatment immediately. Over the next years I began the process of changing my gender. I saw a ""gender therapist, attending support groups, and even put myself on the waiting list for female hormones. Then, when I went to University, I got a wakeup call. There were loads of guys like me, who may not act like the ""manly man"" ideal, but still have no intention to change there gender. That's when I realized that I was going down a dark path, and quickly abanded the idea of me wanting to become a girl. 

During my year in the transgender world, I noticed some things that made me uncomfortable. The following is common retoric from support groups, forums and therapists.


**Everyone who feels confused is transgender**. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. No matter what the story, whether it's about enjoying ""female"" intrests, or something that sounds more like a sexual fetish than a legit medical condition, you are trans according to the user's.


**Any gender non-conforming is proof of trans status**. Like certain movies, music or TV? You are trans. Like wearing bright colored clothes? You are trans. Have more female than male friends? You are trans.


**You are trans, and don't trust anyone who says otherwise**. The most common complaint on these websites is that doctors are ""gatekeeping"" them. Anyone who doubts you in your feelings is evil, and you should lie and cheat your way into getting the treatment you ""need"".


**Asking questions is evil and dangerous""**. Trans people commit suicide all the time, and asking any questions about trans ideology just makes the problem worse. Accept what we say, or gtfo.


**If you are trans, you are amazing**. Trans people love boosting their own and each other's ego's. When you are a depressed teenager who doesn't fit in, this can be huge.

**So where's the conspiracy?** 


When someone takes the hormones they need for ""treatment"", they are prescribe to expensive medication for life, one that requires lots of medical attention. These people are cash cows for the medical industry. Unfortunately, there are not a lot actual transgender people in the world today. So why not make more? I think that big pharma is shilling forums and paying off doctors and therapists to convince people that they need these hormones.


The average trans person, when discussing there time before transition, fits a simple mold. An awkward nerdy teenager who doesn't act like a stereotypical manly guy and doesn't fit in with jocks and ""tough guys"". However, that description probably describes a large portion of the population. That's where the medical company's take advantage of people. By convincing competely normal and healthy people that the need help during a low point in their lives. High school sucks for people like me, but once you leave it gets better. University and the real world isn't high school. But pharmaceutical companies are convincing people that the problem isn't that high school sucks, but instead they are suffering from a serious medical problem, and they need treatment now.

What are your thoughts on my theory? Do I have a point, or am I just rambling?

Instead of seeing sex as an act of love, compassion, understanding and trust, it strips it down to it's most primal form of carnal lust. Then multiplied a thousand fold by every type of porn you can desire being available at your fingertips. 

Porn is centered around this carnal lust lacking any form of love, the penis, and the female form. From a young age this generation of males have been bombarded with sexual imagery from a young age, and with streaming porn a means of instant gratification. 

It doesn't take a lot of research to see where this all leads. The destruction of the traditional family structure and Christian morals. It's all part of ""The Hidden Hand""'s plan.

The Incel, MGTOW, and transgender movements are all direct results of the oversexualization of our youth and the constant bombardment of pornographic propaganda. 

I'm not here to judge anyone for what they do in the privacy of their own bedrooms. I just want to help people realize when they're being used as pawns.

Anyone who's done research into the occult and black magic knows it's based on inversion of morals. (The Satanic pentagram is inverted to have all pleasures of the body above the spirit)

Ever wonder why every porn video ends with the dude ejaculating on the female's face? A complete inversion of the act of making love's climax. Instead of the man's seed going it's intended purpose of advancement of the species.
It's inverted into an entirely misogynistic and purely hedonistic act.

14,I was sent to Afghanistan 2010-11 to be slaughtered so Afghans could buy cell phones. Crazy right? Please let me explain,521.0,jc819o,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jc819o/i_was_sent_to_afghanistan_201011_to_be/,228.0,1602847227.0,"https://cdn.dvidshub.net/media/thumbs/photos/1104/390401/1000w_q95.jpg

One decade ago me and a few hundred other soldiers with 10th Mountain Division were prepping to deploy to COP (combat outpost) Charkh in east Afghanistan. We were told in the leadup that we would be supporting public works projects such as a school and health clinic. We were told we'd be helping coalition forces to track down Osama Bin Laden while helping the Afghani people. Every f'cking thing we were told before, during, and after deployment was a lie. I've had my suspicions for years but the true nature of what we did has come into full view for me recently.

We were told that the school would soon start allowing girls to attend, never happened. The school only allowed boys and was only open very briefly in the beginning of our deployment, keeping that school open was not a priority for us. The school house near our combat outpost became a bombed out shell during the year we were there due to the constant attacks. The clinic couldn't stay open for similar reasons. We barely had what we needed to support our own mission let alone supporting the Afghans. We had very little budget or support but I truly believe this was intentional. We were not there to protect or help the Afghan people, we could barely help ourselves. We were also under standing orders not to fire back when attacked unless we clearly saw a weapon being fired at us, a ridiculous order to those fighting a guerilla war. Death came for us from the shadows always and slipped away to mingle with the locals after. My company had one of the highest death and injury rates in Afghanistan. 
https://www.stripes.com/news/progress-in-one-afghan-district-is-hard-won-still-fragile-troops-say-1.145671

So what was the mission if not supporting locals or even effectively fighting back? 

Three main reasons, imo:

1. To open and protect the bazaar near Charkh so the surrounding villagers could buy phones.(more on this in a moment)

2. To collect biometric data, using a handheld tablet like device, on as many of the villagers in the surrounding regions (up towards Baraki Barak) as possible.

3. And for us to die. Seriously. I genuinely believe those in charge of us wanted us to be killed for political gains.

Taking control of the bazaar was hard, some of our people died taking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8sa8QFNEGI&list=FLTI7pUKiadisjRmVELTsU1g&index=100

Holding Charkh's bazaar was even harder, but holding that shopping district open was of utmost importance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pSergDDpk&list=FLTI7pUKiadisjRmVELTsU1g&index=101

So why? Why did my country allow so many of my brothers to be killed or maimed to open a shopping district rather than actually supporting the locals? 

Because that was our mission. The main draw in Chark's bazaar were cell phone shops, these shops were usually set up near our FMTV's (armored trucks). I believe everything we did was for the sole purpose of building ShadowNet™️'s database, to monitor and control what the Afghani people saw, to influence their elections and maintain control. I see similar things happening here in the US and It's terrifying to me. I've been having war flashbacks for the past several months. 

Please watch Millie Weaver's documentary ShadowGate if you haven't already, I don't want this post getting taken down so I'll post a Bitchute link in the comments. I don't agree with many of her conclusions but the meat of what she's talking about is very, VERY real.

Zucker’s practice was shut down in December 2015. The conspiracy behind transgender medicine.,491.0,dchj9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dchj9k/dr_kenneth_zucker_counseled_560_patients_with_gid/,173.0,1570054532.0,"####**This is just one aspect of many, one piece to the puzzle in understanding the conspiracy of transgender medicine.**

**This is about is ethics, fairness, and quality in medicine and treatment. Those suffering with gender dysphoria deserve the most effective and lowest risk treatments.
But there are blatant injustices surrounding this issue.**

The issue of “gender identity”/transgender health is rapidly evolving and changing the way medicine is being practiced, including standards for children, many of them risky, and largely experimental due to lack of historical precedent.

**When children are essentially pushed in the direction of transition and consequently SRS, it calls into question the “do no harm” principle.** The new standards push transition, and allow for puberty blockers to be given as young as 11 and cross-sex hormones as young as 16 years old (and possibly SRS at 18), the combination of which often causes lifelong infertility and puts them at a number of other health risks.

**There is dissent on this issue within the medical community, and it includes hundreds of medical professionals and scientists.** Just because it is not publicly apparent doesn’t mean that there isn’t disagreement. While it is highly unethical to exclude research simply on the basis that the findings go against the current consensus, that’s exactly what is happening.

If you look at how the standards have shifted, WPATH is the group that first lobbied the APA to change Gender Identity Disorder to “gender dysphoria” essentially declassifying it as a mental illness of a delusional state game to a diagnosis of depression. This “professional” organization has no membership requirement other than an interest in transgenderism. 

The American Academy of Pediatricians (membership of 65,000) adopts new standards and guidelines through use of “special interest groups” (a fraction of the membership) who bring forward their opinions to an executive committee that makes decisions to represent the entire society.

Obviously we are all in favor of strong scientific research in medicine. But there is legitimate dissent within the community that is being ignored.  This is disconcerting, especially when there are children heavily involved and affected.

#**This is what makes it a “conspiracy”....**

The American Psychological Association’s Handbook of Sexuality and Psychology admits that **prior to the widespread promotion of transition affirmation, 75 to 95 percent of pre-pubertal children who were distressed by their biological sex eventually outgrew that distress.** The vast majority came to accept their biological sex by late adolescence after passing naturally through puberty.

Medical transition has now been widely accepted as the new standard for GID despite historical data that shows that psychiatric therapy can be largely effective in treating gender dysphoria. 

Dr. Kenneth Zucker, a psychologist in Toronto who over the course of 35-40 years had counseled 560+patients and had 98% success in males and over 80% success in females in returning to their natal sex. 

Zucker’s practice was shut down in December 2015. [But he sued for unfair dismissal & libel and won, including a public apology from Toronto’s Centre of Addition and Mental Health (CAMH).](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/transgender-orthodoxy-kenneth-zucker-vindicated/amp/)

>*Following three years of legal fees and media silence at the request of his ex-boss and the advice of his lawyers,* ***Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker has reached a public settlement with Toronto’s Centre of Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) for unfair dismissal and libel.*** *The Centre’s $586,000 payout was accompanied by its public apology for, among other things, publishing the false allegation on their website that Dr. Zucker had called a transgender patient “a hairy little vermin.”

>John Adair, Dr. Zucker’s lawyer, wrote by email:*
***The settlement includes a monetary payment that is very large by Canadian standards for a defamation case. We were proud to represent Dr. Zucker in achieving a resounding success that in our view affirms not only his treatment approach but his professional reputation as a world leader in his field.***

>*Dr. Zucker, editor-in-chief of the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, helped shape the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual’s current definition of “gender dysphoria.” Following complaints local activists made to CAMH in 2014, he was investigated by two independent assessors with little experience in childhood gender issues.* ***After his removal in December 2015, though, more than 500 clinicians and researchers within the field signed an open letter to CAMH’s board of trustees, expressing “dismay” at Dr. Zucker’s dismissal and defending his integrity and his “outstanding” contribution to the field.***

>*Though he will sometimes recommend social and medical transition for his patients, Dr. Zucker is guided by the general principle that congruence between a patient’s gender identity and birth sex is the ideal outcome. This approach is informed by decades of case-by-case clinical practice and a small but substantial body of research [...] suggesting that over two-thirds of children with gender dysphoria will realign with their birth sex by the end of adolescence if they have not been exposed to transition-based treatments.*

>***the American Academy of Pediatrics recently released a policy statement whose lead author is Dr. Jason Rafferty, who, according to the PubMed database, has no published papers on gender issues other than policy statements. Yet the statement — backed by activists and approved by a committee of 24 pediatricians and a maximum of twelve AAP board members (according to an AAP insider), and intended for use by the 67,000 member pediatricians — recommended a strikingly simplistic, one-size-fits-all gender-affirming approach for “transgender” youth.***

>*When Dr. James Cantor of Sexology Today! fact-checked the policy statement, however, he discovered that* ***many of the sources it cited directly contradicted claims made in the document itself. Dr. Zucker, whose work is not cited once despite his authority, also said that the AAP statement was “shockingly bad scholarship” and that it makes bold assertions where the research literature is weak or nonexistent.***

>***Zucker calls attention to Temple Newhook’s obfuscation of the effects of socially transitioning of pre-pubescent children.*** *He writes: 
“I would hypothesize that when more follow-up data of children who socially transition prior to puberty become available, the persistence rate will be extremely high. This is not a value judgment—it is simply an empirical prediction . . .* ***parents who support, implement, or encourage a gender social transition (and clinicians who recommend one) are implementing a psychosocial treatment that will increase the odds of long-term persistence.”***

>*Taking the “desistance myth” and inverting it perfectly, Zucker shows how the Temple Newhook commentary speaks against desistance by pushing social transition...*

***

>###**The “desistance myth” is no myth—**

>*[In 2016, transgender advocate Brynn Tannehill wrote in the Huffington Post about the “desistance myth,”](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/07/21972/) attempting to discredit a dozen studies that demonstrate that a majority of children identifying as transgender cease do to so as they enter adulthood. Tannehill believes that desistance is a fiction “built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia.”* ***Yet Tannehill never defines these terms, nor does she validate these accusations with any proof. Even so, this false narrative—that desistance is a myth—has become part of the transgender lobby’s push to medicalize gender non-conforming children.***

>*The evidence is clear: the “desistance myth” is no myth. The consistent findings about gender-dysphoria desistance are real, to the chagrin of the more militant transgender advocates. When the evidence is studied, it is clear that the dissemination of the “desistance myth” is an attempt to render scientific truths fictional. It also works to de-emphasize the dangers of social transition that pushes the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.*

Hoogland is a father to a gender non-conforming biological female 14-year-old who identifies as transgender and prefers the use of male pronouns. Hoogland has repeatedly called this person his daughter, though the court has forbade it.

On Tuesday at 10 am Vancouver time, Hoogland surrendered himself to the court in response to the Attorney General of British Columbia's warrant his arrest for contempt. He was the arrested and jailed. The warrant was issued by Judge Tammen on March 4, 2021.

Hoogland opposes his child's undergoing ""gender affirmative"" medical procedures, and has stated this opposition again and again, in the hope of saving his child from irreversible harm. The Canadian medical system, the legal system, and the child's mother press ahead with social and medical transition of the child.

On December 14, 2020, Hoogland was compelled by Justice Mazari's court to collude in the gender ""transitioning"" of his fourteen year old daughter and told not to call his biological female child his daughter. In response, Hoogland made a Charter challenge engaging his right to freedom of speech.

When he appeared in family court, the judge forced him to sit in the prisoners' dock, said Hoogland's lawyer Carey Lind said, even though he was guilty of no crime. The judge referred to him as ""the accused."" Lind made an application for the judge to recuse himself on the basis that all of this was prejudicial.

I studied bio science. I protested for climate. I protested for equal marriage rights. I protested for working rights. Supported welfare and public health. Always been a union member. Planted trees. Rescued animals. Protested against both gulf wars. Voted left my entire life. Laughed and talked with trans women in toilets. Etc etc etc 

But I just can’t do the current left causes. It’s gone too far. I can’t do corrupt mRNA jabs, corporate political covid science & stats. I can’t do segregating the unvaxxed. I can’t do no voter id. I can’t do trans women in biological female sport. I can’t do sex & transgender ed for prepubescent school kids. I can’t do zero boundaries of behaviour for traumatised minorities. I can’t do greenwashed false co2 economies. I can’t do a confusing array of pronouns. 

The really sad thing is - these extremes have been seeded into education & left politics by my arch fucking enemies - the Davos Group-World Economic Forum-banking family-psychopath billionaires, who seek transhumanism, digital identity, central bank digital currency & greenwashing. 

The Davos billionaires and banking families literally hijacked my side of politics. I now have more in common with conservatives. 

It reminds me of when I listened to underground alternative and grunge bands in the late 80s and very early 90s and then suddenly it was infiltrated by major labels & the mainstream for profit. 

The stupid thing is - both left and right hate the unelected billionaire Davos Group. And if they could just put aside their current differences for a while and unite, the world would no longer be under the control of the bankers & billionaires, who are flooding the world with concurrent, destructive, all pervasive, corrupt, technocratic, corporate health & science biowarfare in a corrupt system that allows a handful of people to take all the wealth. That allows them to get away with their past pushing of excessive consumerism & deliberate destruction of technology patents that could’ve given us better energy sources decades ago.

While most consider it to be a heinous act comparable to crimes against humanity. There are those who wish to soften the perception of a sexual relationship between adult and child. This is an age old problem that has been around for centuries.. Evidence showing it has gone as far back as 1650 BC. To understand why it is such a widespread problem we must first educate ourselves in a bit of history. 

There are many famous and well known examples of an adult marrying a significantly younger partner, sometimes as young as 10 years old. [Mohammed the prophet of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed) is one such example.

>Traditional sources dictate that Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad, but the marriage was not consummated until she was nine or ten years old. While the majority of traditional sources indicate Aisha was 9 (and therefore a virgin) at the time of marriage, a small number of more recent writers have variously estimated her age at 15 to 24.

Rome was also well known for its pederast societal members as well. While men were not looked down upon for premarital sex, women were expected to be virgins at marriage. So this led to a larger acceptance of adult men and young boys engaging in sexual activities in Greco Roman culture. It was less acceptable to engage in these activities for purely pleasure, and was less frowned upon when looked at as a loving relationship and friendship. It was often used in a military setting too.

Multiple Roman Emperors engaged in Pederasty including Hadrian, Tiberius, Caligula. Hadrian most famous for Antinous, and Tiberius for his palace of depravity where he had sex with infants and children of all sorts. He was also very bloodthirsty and tortured many people for entertainment before throwing them off a 300ft cliff. [More info on Tiberius.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#43)

I could bring up countless examples of pedophilia throughout history, but you get the idea. There are common themes that seem to transcend historical society norms with pederasty and pedophilia. There were also those willing to enable this behavior for money, political gains, and the covering up and hiding of these acts.

- People with large amounts of wealth and power engaging in pedophilia.

- Ritualistic abuse of children and rituals involving children which include, orgies, sacrifices, sex magic, the [Cretan Kidnapping ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_pederasty), and satanic or devil worship to name some of the many rituals done with pedophilia.

- Pedophilia also used as political leverage and blackmail against leaders of countries.

#Pedophilia in modern times

Pedophilia in modern times is still as prevalent as it was in the past. With the invention of the internet like minded folks were able to connect from miles away across continents to conspire and commit these acts. There are many instances of pedophilia entrenched in modern social power structures. Here are a few examples.

- The Franklin Investigation
 - This was an investigation that started as financial crimes but then soon quickly turned into investigating a wide spread US based child trafficking ring. This possibly implicated George Bush Sr and high ranking politicians in the United States along with many other wealthy prolific members of society. The abusers engaged in depraved acts of murder, rape, torture, and often made their victims have sex with dead children. One victim stated that a severed penis of a young boy was put in his mouth while adult males laughed at and raped him. Ultimately no one was charged with anything except financial crimes. This centered around Larry King and his close ties with Republican leadership. The FBI was accused of threatening witnesses and helping the cover up of this crime.

- Dutroux Affair
 - This was a serial killer who captured girls as young as 8 and held them captive in his dungeon/basement. This case was heavily criticized as the police almost seemed complicit in the acts. In conducting one search of the home two officers failed to locate two girls locked in his basement. The victims allege the police located them but left them there. The UK has had multiple scandals involving pedophilia and subsequent coverups. It is theorized it is deeply entrenched in their social hierarchy and government agencies. 

 - On the witness stand, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described ""the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out. Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates."" Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. ""Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry,"" he said. He believed that the Mafia had taken control of the case. Dutroux alleged he was part of a sex trafficking ring involving high ranking government and police officials.

- Jimmy Savile
 - A well known TV personality and TV show host was at the center  of many, many allegations of abuse. The coverup of his actions by BBC was alleged to be an open secret. Former Sex Pistols vocalist accused Jimmy of abusing children and it being public knowledge. It should come as no surprise as Jimmy was friends with Prince Charles and BBC recently was told to remove a pedophilia statue from it's building. [source](http://www.news.com.au/world/bbc-told-to-remove-work-by-pedophile-sculptor-eric-gill/news-story/4faff31313e1d95b20e157858121d55a)

- Jeffrey Epstein
 - Known for ""Lolita Island"" and having many high ranking US government officials over at his island for parties. Bill Clinton is one such guest who even ditched his Secret Service detail multiple times on trips to said island. Also known for getting an extraordinarily light sentence for crimes only serving 10 months and being able to leave the country freely.

There are many, more cases than what I have outlined and I implore you to research, explore, and spread awareness of these documented cases.

#The Effort To Normalize Pedophilia.

Pedophilia has been labeled as a mental disorder. Those wishing to normalize such behavior in society argue that it is how they were born and are unable to change. A terrible argument that would excuse serial killers for having a disorder of wanting to murder others. However, the efforts are out there if you look around. I believe pedophiles are pushing the transgender issue as a way of riding the coattails of a legitimate cause and trying to legitimize itself by proxy. This indefensible act is a conscious effort to harm a child and that is the cold hard fact of the matter. It is a conscious decision no matter how they try to wrap it up in psychological excuses for their actions.

[Greece labels Pedophilia as disability](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/world/europe/greek-disability-groups-angered-by-new-categories.html)

I believe the effort to brand children as transgender is mostly inorganic and is social engineering to lead to a society where a child can make decisions independent of their parents wishes.
It starts with slowly seeding the idea into peoples heads by placing their propaganda in high visibility and recognized parental advice resources. There is a large amount of appealing to emotion and lack of studies that show what happens when children go through such changes such as sex reassignment. It is nothing more than cosmetic surgery but parents are being compelled into believing it is something beneficial for the child. 

http://www.parents.com/parenting/my-transgender-child-this-is-how-i-know/

Here is some examples of parents allowing extremely young children to undergo hormone therapy.

There are large efforts underway to label children as young as 4 years old as transgender

https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-08-12-transgender-summer-camp-now-enrolling-toddlers-as-young-as-four-years-old.html

http://www.scarymommy.com/parents-of-5-year-old-transgender-girl-share-their-story/

There are many stories similar to these. The common theme is that a *four* year old has the ability to decide if it can change its sex or not. Even though many trans-activists, pediatricians, and child psychologists consider this way too young, it is still being pushed. 

I believe the end game is to have this question being asked on a large public scale ""Well a child can choose its sex, why can't it choose to have sex as well?""

Sweden also legally acknowledged a child marriage from refugee's of muslim countries. Before they were introducing legislation to combat this same problem. [source](https://www.thelocal.se/20120524/41012) However, the agenda most be rolled out it seems as they are now backtracking on law passed in May of 2004 that outlawed any marriage under the age of 18. [source](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=6096214) They have admitted it was ""a mistake"" but that does not excuse officials condoning this and having a special set of rules for refugee's entering their country as citizens. Had this not been in the media I believe it would of continued to set a precedent and push for younger and younger children making legal adult decisions. Europe seems to be a social engineering experiment as much as the United States and it is sickening they are trying to force this old archaic practice on modern society. It is done purposefully in my opinion.

I cannot see a purpose for pushing such an agenda except to weaken the family foundations and slowly creep in the public perception that a child knows best for itself rather than an experienced adult who has been down that road before. To open a path to separate children from parents by brainwashing the whole family unit to think this is acceptable for prepubescent children to undergo hormone therapy and cosmetic surgery! **-More input needed WIP**

I am not trying to offend anyone here, but to me it makes more sense than just ""a man trapped in a woman's body"" and vice versa.

There are studies showing that the brain is wired differently depending on gender, but I like to say you should never think something is true just because a ""study says"". This guy explains the subject very well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw
In reality, the study just shows brains more feminine or masculine, it doesn't have anything to do with gender. Of course if you scan a trans woman's brain you're gonna see feminine features, I have personally never heard of a trans woman who likes to be hairy and masculine and have lots of muscles etc. (yes that sounds like a stereotype but it's just so you can understand what I mean better). The ""shape"" of your brain will only determine your personality, not your gender.

So from that point, ""sex"" or ""gender"" is just biological, what we call gender identities are just personalities. Yes masculinity and femininity is a spectrum, not gender. Gender only means what you have between your legs so you can reproduce. There is no such thing as a MAN or a WOMAN. We are people, with different personalities and genitals that's all.

So yes, to me being obsessed with wanting to look like the opposite gender is a mental illness. I am a girl, but I've always wanted to be a boy, when I understood I would grow up to be a girl, I cried all the time. I wanted to be a boy so freaking bad, I hated my body, to me my life was ruined because I wasn't a boy. And every single one of these feelings are still valid today, nothing has changed.

I have a mental illness, which is gender identity disorder. I don't even agree with how it's called, because gender is not an identity, it's a biological factor. How my brain works is not up to me, I don't choose to cry every night because I'm a girl, that's just how I am. But this is ruining my life because I just can't be happy because of that illness.

So from that, to all the jerks who hate on us saying we are mentally ill, well DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN. Find that freaking miraculous pill that will stop gender dysphoria, because no I don't want to mutilate my body and take hormones, I just have to for my own happiness! So if there was any real cure, believe me I would take it. 

So thank you for being more understanding of people who choose to transition, but stop promoting it like it's normal and a good thing to do. IT'S NOT. Focus on finding a cure instead of pushing us to go through so much pain... 

EDIT: First off I wanna say thank you to everyone that answered this post! It made me feel so much better, so thank you guys for that. I also want to thank that guy again who shared with me this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmCBKaKOtOrEqgsL4-3C8Q  She's a transgender youtuber who explains so well what I meant to say through this post.
Now whether or not I decide to transition, it will be MY choice to make MY life better. 
If you are trans and you read this, please don't fall in this social stigma that tells you you're a special snowflake therefore a minority therefore a victim etc. You are YOU and being trans is only like 1% of who you are... Don't let it define your life nor future.

Not a lot of people understand exactly what they do. A little crash course before I get to the meat of this conspiracy.

 Aromatase is the process in the body of converting testosterone to estrogen, testosterone can convert to estrogen but estrogen cannot convert to testosterone. Testosterone is produced in the testicles and adrenal gland  and estrogen is produced in the ovaries and through aromatase so both males and females have different levels of testosterone and estrogen. Foods also contain testosterone and estrogen, oysters are a common aphrodisiac which means to increase libido because they are rich in testosterone and testosterone is responsible for libido. Soy is rich in estrogen for instance and I will get to that, think about how much food is soy based.

Obesity, smoking pot, drinking alcohol, overstimulated libido, and high cardio activity are things that convert testosterone to estrogen. Guys, after binging on porn or prolonged sexual activity do you notice randomly going limp after a while? Estrogen is a vasoconstricter which is the opposite of viagra and constricts the blood vessels to kill erections, that happens when being turned on for too long and the excess testosterone converting to estrogen causing vasoconstriction. Same reason getting drunk makes guys horny then kills erections.

We start the same in utero, The Y chromosome causes a slight imbalance in testosterone and what would be the ovaries in females develops into testicles and the testosterone from those further androgenize the fetus into a male. 

So now that we understand that let us get to the meat of this and how to force feminize a population on men and have girls mature way too early. Ever hear of BPA in plastic? BPA mimics the effects of estrogen and will feminize men, especially little boys before puberty.

Before puberty males and females are very similar. If a prepubescent boy takes in a lot of BPA then he will start female puberty and begin to transition before the testicles drop and produce enough testosterone to start male puberty. Tender breasts, gynecomastia (man boobs), wide hips, a layer of subcutaneous fat, high voice, lack of body hair growth.....these are all traits of female puberty that many male children exhibit.

What happens is too much BPA and a young boy will begin a female transition the same as being transgender but then the testicles drop, male puberty begins, and rips the boy out of female puberty, but things like breast growth, bone frame, and brain development are permanent and the mental effects of detransition and starting male puberty will cause severe depression and dysphoria.

Little boys grow up identifying as women can be from the BPA causing them to transition into female before male puberty and they are use to it. Testicles dropping during female puberty and the testosterone will feel unnatural and cause dysphoria and the boy will naturally want to continue female puberty instead.

In young girls the BPA will put estrogen levels at the level for puberty to begin way earlier than it should and can start puberty years earlier. Too much estrogen will cause breast cancer, after puberty when the ovaries produce normal estrogen levels the BPA will cause an excess and breast cancer can happen.

This destroys ""men"" and causes girls to mature early, get cancer, and die early. I believe this is by design.

Lets take Japan as an example and asians, the culture, and effects of hormones. Japanese people eat a lot of soy and that is rich in estrogen. Traits of estrogen are good skin, high voice, lack of body and facial hair, smaller frames, low libido and low sex drive. Testosterone causes facial hair, body hair, cranial ridge, large chin, strong jawline, wide shoulders, large ribs and frame. As a culture Japanese eat lots of soy/estrogen, the men display many female secondary sexual characteristics as a culture and very few masculine traits associated with testosterone. Coincidence? How many Japanese men do you see with strong chins, a cranial ridge, lots of body hair, a thick beard, and a deep voice? Not many right?

Japanese women are petite, great skin, very little body hair, and very feminine in general. This is just a theory, but to me it appears that ingesting a lot of soy has caused racial traits to be affected by hormones on a racial level. I would think cultures that are naturally larger in frame with more masculine traits is probably because something the culture eats that is rich in testosterone and has a similar but opposite effect and the racial traits come from testosterone in the food.

That is just an example. When I was a freshmen in highschool in the 90's the seniors all had full beards and were very masculine. By the time I was a senior we noticed the freshman were looking really small compared to us, the freshmen girls were developed and we were like wow, girls didn't look like that when we were freshmen! I thought back on that after learning about hormones.

The conspiracy? I think ""men"" are being thinned out and girls are developing early to over sexualize them for the porn industry. We need men, big strong, dominant, alpha males to lead and protect. When it comes time to protect ourselves from the enemy it is going to be a bunch of feminized males and that puts us in a bad spot physically. A nation of feminized men is much easier to control than a bunch of big strong dominant alpha males raging with testosterone I would imagine.

If I wanted to take over the world (which I don't) this would be one of the steps, to force feminize the nation to destroy the alpha male, that would make it much easier. I can't imagine that this isn't by design and that nobody has thought of this except me, I am watching it happen.

I believe there are people who have a feminine spirit and born male, or a masculine spirit born female and the desire to have a body that fits the spirit is a real thing and being transgender is not unnatural, just look up native american's five genders. There is male body/male spirit, female body/female spirit, male body/female spirit, female body/male spirit, and the rare male&female spirit in either body known as two spirits (which I believe I fall under). Two spirit people are able to view the world through the eyes of both genders and have a unique perspective, they were medicine men, historians, musicians, shamans, and held a high place of honor amongst the native american people. A family with a two spirit was considered a great blessing. Children were free to express either gender and got to decide which right of passage they would choose when they were ready.

On the other hand I believe many people are genuinely just confused because they never got to experience natural hormone levels of their gender do to BPA in the plastic and identify with the gender they started to transition to first. A lot of boys will go through partial female puberty first though and that will shape their gender identity instead of the spirit and that seems wrong to me. If they had normal hormone levels they might have felt natural as their own gender with no dysphoria but that was stolen from them and all they ever knew was puberty from the wrong gender.

I never see anyone discuss this and I came up with this theory myself so maybe people just haven't noticed this happening yet and I though it might be important so I want to share my theory.

39,Occupy Wall Street vs. Black Lives Matter — Analysis of an organic movement as opposed to a manufactured movement.,165.0,h0bssv,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h0bssv/occupy_wall_street_vs_black_lives_matter_analysis/,26.0,1591798331.0,"I want to begin by saying that I am against police brutality and have spent several years on Reddit highlighting abuses of power done by the police and am in no way a fan of the police and do believe that they disproportionately target black people. However, I believe that this is more of a class issue than a racial issue and that the police have no fear when they are dealing with regular Americans who are 1 missed paycheck away from financial disaster and I am going to explain this in greater detail later. 

The Occupy Wall Street protest movement, in which I proudly participated in, began in 2011 as a reaction to the 2008 Wall Street crash. Inspired by the protesters in Egypt who had recently toppled the despotic government there, regular working class Americans were increasingly agitated that they had become poorer as a result of the crash and the wealthy had only become wealthier and to top that off, the Obama Administration decided not to prosecute any bankers for their role in creating the Crash of '08. 

If you look at [Occupy Wall Street's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street), it states that OWS was [originally conceived by Katie Lash, a writer at AdBusters, which is a Canadian anti-consumerist news outlet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street#Origins) Lash called for a Million-Man March on Wall Street starting on September 17th, 2011 and the first such call for action was published in a February 2nd, 2011 edition of AdBusters. Over the course of that year, more buzz about a March on Wall Street began to spread around leftist message boards online that were populated by people that had grew frustrated with the Obama Administration lack of action against bankers who were complicit in causing the '08 Crash and also at their coziness with Wall Street in general. 

Now let's compare this to the Black Lives Matter movement's founding. If you look at the [Wikipedia page for Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Founding) it has nothing at all specific about the founding of Black Lives Matter. No specific person is referenced as being the founder of Black Lives Matter or initially calling for the movement itself, which is highly suspicious. The [Founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Founding) section of the BLM Wikipedia page only references what movements that influenced BLM. 

Now let's talk moolah. 

Occupy Wall Street never got anywhere near the level of financial assistance from the wealthy that BLM has received, like not even close. According to a January 2nd, 2012 New York Times article where they interviewed OWS finance group member, Peter Dutro, [the group had raised more than $700,000 with the vast majority coming from people making between $50,000 and $100,000 and the average donation amount totaled to just $22.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street#Funding) This article and interview are from January of 2012, a couple of months after OWS encampments were systematically dismantled in cities across the country in a joint state and federal government operation. So after the group had already reached its zenith in terms of influence and media attention. $700,000, the vast majority of which came from average working class people like us, with an average donation of $22. Pretty paltry numbers there when you think about it. 

Now let's compare this with BLM's funding. The first thing that stuck out to me was just how brief and vague the section on [BLM's funding is on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Funding) Like suspiciously short. What's worst is what that little snippet contains, it states that BLM has been the recipient of over $100 million in funding from the Open Society Foundations, Ford Foundation and Borealis Philanthropy among others.

**over $100,000,000**

Let's compare that with the $700,000 from regular working folks for OWS. 

Furthermore, BLM received a ludicrous amount of funding from international raider and Wall Street cretin George Soros, who runs the Open Society. BLM has received a sizable chunk of their funding from one of the most evil bankers on Earth. Make of that what you will, but I don't remember ever hearing about the Black Panthers or the Nation of Islam receiving millions of dollars from the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds. This bit about the source of the funding is a damning blow the the Black Lives Matter movement for me, it simply reveals to much. As a matter of fact the thing that got me down this rabbit hole was an interview I saw on DJ Vlad's YouTube channel with an average rapper named Lord Jamar. [In the interview, Lord Jamar states that he is not a BLM supporter because it is not an organic movement and it is not a movement that belongs to black people, that it was given to them by the social engineers of our society.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXCDNh7LfM4) It's a great video and it's definitely worth a listen/watch. 

Now we come to the media and their treatment of the respective protest movements.

OWS was endlessly attacked, maligned and undermined by the corporate media. Their goals were never accurately reported upon by the mainstream media and the worst aspects of the protest movement were amplified across the airwaves. [OWS was accused of being anti-Semitic by the corporate media,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street#Anti-semitism_accusations) they were also [criticized for their lack of diversity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street#Lack_of_minority_representation)

All in all the mainstream media hated OWS, because OWS, at the end of the day was all about class warfare between the haves and the increasingly larger group of have-nots in America. Class warfare is a subject that makes the corporate media very uncomfortable because the talking heads on corporate media news channel's are all millionaires and the get very nervous when they hear the plebs, who they are paid to manipulate, grumbling about gathering up the pitchforks and heading down to the rich neighborhoods for some good ole' fashioned American class warfare. 

Now let's compare this with the largely positive media representation that BLM has been given. BLM is a media darling on CNN and MSNBC and that is not sugar-coating it at all. Their positive actions are amplified, their negative actions are swept under the rug. The only place where BLM receives somewhat negative coverage is predictably on Fox News, and that's just because Fox News represents the Right so they have to take a right-wing viewpoint on protest movements and racial issues. You actually had widespread looting and vandalism take place that was cloaked in peaceful protest and the corporate media swept that under the rug. I remember when the corporate media had a video of an Occupy Wall Street protester publicly defecating in a park and they practically ran it 24/7 for a week like it was the only thing happening at these protests. When it comes to widespread looting taking place during BLM protests, they are so quick to rationalize and explain it all way. 

The reason why the media has become so egregiously bad since Occupy Wall Street (and they weren't great before it either) is because of a thing called Operation Mockingbird.

[Operation Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird#:~:text=Operation%20Mockingbird%20is%20an%20alleged,and%20magazines%20as%20front%20organizations.) is a covert CIA program that began during the Cold War to influence journalists in newsroom across the U.S to publish pro-U.S government and business propaganda. It was supposedly ended sometime during the 70's, but I mean come on. Just look at how much more divisive the media has become since Occupy Wall Street. 

Now every single news story is something racial or anything else to play up differences that working class have with one another. Every single issue has been politicized and weaponized the CIA-controlled mainstream media. Every single news story that can divide up regular Americans to hate each other is cranked up to 11 and broadcast across every platform that is under the control of the CIA. This is all just to get you to take your attention away from the rich that have been looting the country for the past 40 years through low tax rates and tax loopholes and overseas tax shelters. 

Occupy Wall Street was a real scare for the ruling elite of this country, it was the closest thing they experienced to a peasants revolt since the 1930's. 

The ruling elite are very intelligent. They study history and learned from the Great Depression and the 1930's. The Great Depression resulted in the election of FDR and the implementation of his pro-working class New Deal legislation, which brought us amazing things like Social Security as well a slew of other of things that raised living standards of the average Americans. The rich, because they are greedy sociopaths, hated FDR and even conspired to have him overthrown in a coup plot in 1933 known as [the Business Plot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)

The wealthy rulers of this country realized that the average working class was too united and this allowed them to unify democratically and elect leaders that would pass legislation that would help working class people and not the rich. To protect against this the wealthy began buying up the country's newspapers and consolidating them into news corporations that would report the news to fit their agenda.

Hasn't anyone noticed how every single difference regular working Americans have with one another is amplified as if it is the only thing going on in the country?

White vs. Black

Gay vs. Straight

Christian vs. Muslim

Male/female vs. transgender

Civilian vs. Police Officer

Native vs. Immigrant

The only groups that the corporate media never pit against one another are the rich vs. the poor and that is not a coincidence, its intentional. 

Anyways these have just been things that have been on my mind the last couple of days what with everything going on. 

Also a disclaimer, I'm not white, so please don't think this is coming from a racist place. Like I said earlier, we desperately need police reform in this country, however I think that the way that BLM is going about it is only going to polarize Americans further, and that is not a mistake, it was carefully socially engineered by people like George Soros, to keep regular poor Americans hating each other and to keep the spotlight off of the Robber Barons like himself, who have been robbing us blind the past 40+ years.",conspiracy,Transgender

Unfortunately this natural ability and knowledge in distinguishing between male and female has been programmed out of us.  

It’s not a coincidence that they don’t teach anatomy as a standard in schools. All we learn in school are the differences in reproductive organs, yet the skeleton is the primary indicator of sex (used by forensics).  

The practice of gender inversion in elite circles is a part of their satanic “Religion” (BAPHOMET worship).  It’s an occult practice.  I’m not saying all celebrities/elite figures are transgender, but it’s a significant number.  

In general, assess these traits:

* *shoulder width and shape

* *size of the hips relative to the shoulders.

* *shape of the back (curvature)

* *q-angle

* *relative size of skull, neck, arms, legs, feet, and kneecaps.

* *digit ratio

* *brow-ridge, jawline, Adam’s apple

* *subcutaneous body fat

*Also males and females have different “energy”—for lack of a better word—in their eyes.  Males tend to have a hard, sharp, or slightly intimidating look in their stare and females tend to have a softer look.  FTM tend to have a ‘lost’ or ‘distant’ look to their eyes.  This is obviously subjective but there is a distinction to be made there.*

That doesn't stop the GOP from continuing to spread those LIES though.,110.0,v69570,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/v69570/uvalde_shooter_was_cisgender_and_not_on/,34.0,1654537412.0,"*Michelle Fiore insisted that the Uvalde shooter was taking ""pharmaceutical psychotropic drugs"" and was ""transgendering"" so there's no need to question why he was allowed to get an assault rifle.* 

A Republican elected official in Nevada is joining the chorus of GOP politicians who are trying to deflect blame for mass shootings from guns to transgender people.

“I have to tell you what happened in Texas is horrific,” Republican Nevada state treasurer candidate and current Las Vegas city Council member Michelle Fiore said at a recent appearance. “All the liberal media is going to you, oh it’s guns, it’s guns, it’s kind of- We got to ban AR-15s. No we do not.”

She went on a rant that started out about “the pharmaceutical industry,” which she claimed are giving kids “pharmaceutical psychotropic drugs.”

“Nobody wants to talk about the drug issue,” she said, adding that the shooter in Uvalde, Texas who killed 19 children and two adults two weeks ago “was on psychotropics.” [The shooter wasn’t even in the mental health care system](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/02/uvalde-school-shooting-student-mental-health-program/), and there’s no evidence that he was on psychotropic medications.

But Fiore didn’t appear concerned with the facts, repeating the false rumor that the shooter was transgender: “He was also on a lot of different medications from transgendering. So his mind was quite defective.”

[Just after the shooting two weeks ago](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/05/maga-congressman-falsely-blames-transgender-person-texas-school-shooting/), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said that the killer was transgender, repeating misinformation that was sweeping far-right and white nationalist websites.

“It’s a transsexual leftist illegal alien,” Gosar tweeted. “It’s apparently your kind of trash.”

The shooter was cisgender and a U.S. citizen.

“There is an overwhelming number of individuals who are posting images of this person, who was the shooter, and information about the nature of them being transgender,” rightwing radio host Stacy Washington said, referring to pictures of a transgender woman who was not the shooter but whose pictures were shared online.

[Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) repeated](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/05/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-uvalde-shooter-cross-dressing/) the misinformation last week on a webcast: the shooter “clearly had a lot of mental issues going on, as was shown with him wearing eyeliner, cross-dressing, a lot of his language, being a loner.”

>A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so. Restrictions on a quarantined community include:

1.     Requiring an account with a verified email address
1.     Requiring an explicit opt-in
1.     No custom images
1.     Will generate no revenue, including ads or Reddit Gold



The important part of this is:


>A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when **we deem** its content to be extremely offensive or **upsetting to the average redditor**


So, what is talked about on here that may be offensive to the average reddit user (in no particular order)?

1. 9/11
1. USS liberty
1. Operation Paperclip
1. Intelligence agencies creating faux terrorists/boogie men around the world
1. Critical of the government (politicians are puppets), call out the shadow government
3. GMO's/hormones in our food effecting people's genetics/hormones
4. Critical of the militarization of the police and police brutality
5. Critical of these endless wars, and call out the truth behind them
6. Critical of the PC SJW agenda
1. Zionism influencing US Politics and foreign policy
2. Israel and Palestine, and the war crimes Israel is committing (Israel treats Palestinians like the Nazi's treated the Jews)
7. The transgender agenda

Just to name a few. 


Now any of those could be deemed by any ""average reddit user"" as offensive, which puts us in the cross hairs. As I've said above, quarantining a subreddit will put restrictions on that subreddit. My main concerns with the restrictions are these:

1.     Requiring an account with a verified email address
1.     Requiring an explicit opt-in

If you are asking, okay what's wrong with that?

1. By making people verify their email address, it makes it less likely a lurker (on the fence conspiracy theorist/truth seeker) will stop by and see what alternative news is being talked about here. Many people come here from say /r/worldnews to see another side of the story. This adds an unnecessary step (people are lazy), most ""average redditor"" will not enter their email address, go to said email inbox and press the verify link. It will also do away with throwaway accounts.
2. By requiring an explicit opt-in, this will stigmatize /r/conspiracy (and other alt subs) with the likes of other quarantined subreddits. Hence, associating us with some of the most vile subreddits on reddit. This too, may also deter people on the fence or mildly interested in ever seeing alternative news/conspiracy theories. Because the opt-in implies, topics talked about inside this sub were determined to qualify it to be quarantined (racist, hateful, blah blah, etc). I imagine it will be a splash page similar to 18+(porn) subreddits. Most people will just say ""fuck it"", I'd rather look at cats and funnies or a subreddit like /r/worldnews or /r/news, etc. Only truly curious people will do these steps (I say 20% actually would). This further segregates alternative news/theories from people who need to know this information


By doing these two very things, the truth movement is quarantined from the very people, who need to/should see it. I see this as an overall strategy of censoring the internet and I feel like now with the reddit changes and how the FCC will be regulating the internet (net neutrality), things will only get worse for the truth movement.

**The very first things that usually come up in headlines, articles or reddit comments are often  accidentally misinterpreted, purposely misinterpreted or just pure propaganda and fabrication.**

# Example 1: The Iranian regime hangs people for being gay

No, it doesn't. While, Iran certainly a terrible place to be gay and many people are still very homophobic, it isn't a place with capital punishment for being gay is practiced. People aren't being hunted for being gay either. Here a small except from the actual situation in Iran:

>More and more, I see gay and [lesbian couples](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/09/in-search-of-gay-tehran.html) being openly affectionate on the streets. Transgender individuals live and work openly in Tehran, the [government will even pay for sex reassignment surgery](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29832690) for those who want it. Gay hook-up apps like Grindr, Scruff, and Hornet are easy to access and increasing in popularity.  
>  
>In recent years small pockets of gay public life have established themselves around the city. Most nights a well known park near the City Theatre and the university of Tehran becomes a vibrant cruising ground for gay men. They come to trawl the park, to look, to show off, exchanging furtive glances in the dark, occasionally meeting for a few minutes in the public facilities or heading to some third location for more comprehensive interaction.""  
>  
>Source: [The Guardian: Intimate spaces: coming out in Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces)

Now where does this misinformation come from?

Most articles refer to [one case in 2005, where two 18 year olds were hanged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Asgari_and_Ayaz_Marhoni). The British group OutRage! alleged that the boys had been executed for engaging in consensual homosexual sex, but  actually the two were convicted for raping a 13 year old boy. Human Rights Watch condemned the use of the death penalty in Iran. It stated that the two ""were put to death on July 19 after they were found guilty of sexually assaulting a thirteen-year-old boy some fourteen months earlier,"" but did not address whether those charges were accurate.

In addition to Human Rights Watch, Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the **International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission**, has also said ""It was not a gay case.""[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Asgari_and_Ayaz_Marhoni#cite_note-autogenerated1-16)

# Example 2: In Iran they're stoning women for adultery

Actually they're stoning nobody. Stoning is defacto not used as a form of punishment in Iran and there has been no reported case in at least 10 years. It happened that lower courts sentenced people to death by stoning, but this was always overruled by higher courts.

The last famous about ""stoning because of adultery"" that made headlines and triggered protests worldwide was about [a woman that was accused of being complicit in the murder of her husband by her lover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakineh_Mohammadi_Ashtiani). Of course potentially she could have known nothing of the murder and the charges are made up, but the guy is actually dead.

# Example 3: Iranians hate Jews/want to kill Jews

No, actually Jews are protected in Iran. Iran has the second biggest Jewish community in the Middle East. Here from an [interview about the life of Jews](https://www.dw.com/en/jewish-life-in-iran-was-always-better-than-in-europe/a-38847143) in Iran:

>Jews are a recognized minority here, so we can practice our religion freely. We have more than 20 working synagogues in Tehran and at least five kosher butcheries. In some European countries that is not allowed because of animal rights. In Iran, it is.  
>  
>Generally speaking, the Jews' condition in Iran has always been better than in Europe. In our country's history, there was never a time when all Iranians had the same religion, race or language, so there is a high degree of tolerance.[Source: DW](https://www.dw.com/en/jewish-life-in-iran-was-always-better-than-in-europe/a-38847143)

The Iranian president congratulates Jews on their Jewish holidays. The religious supreme leader constantly repeats that they have absolutely nothing against Jews either.

# Example 4: The Iranian regime constantly threatens to destroy Israel

If we're talking about physical destruction with bombs then this surely didn't happen in the last 10-15 years, possibly never. (**I'd love to be proven wrong: Did a supreme leader, president, foreign minister ever say something like that: Please post examples!**)

Why is this constantly being claimed? The answer here is once again propaganda or misinformation. The Iranian ""regime"" is against the Israeli government and against Israel. Iran says, that Israel is commits human rights violations against Palestinians and their annexation plans and settler policy and fears their aggression. They believe Israel shouldn't have been created, but do not suggest war or destruction that civilians in the region. Israel is allied with the USA, assassinates Iranian scientists, blows up factories in Iran, flies bomb attacks against Iranian bases in Syria and does cyber attacks against Iranian infrastructure. We in the west think this is for good reason, because Israel protects itself, but in Iranians disagree.Usually they call the government the ""Zionist Regime"" and the most famous quote was one about the supreme leader saying that ""God willing, the Zionist Regime won't exist anymore in 25 years"". This has been re-interpreted in ""destroying Israel"", ""nuclear destruction of Israel"" and ""killing of all Jews"".

Why can the we talk about wanting the Iranian regime gone without issues, but whenever Iran talks about the Israeli government it's reported as the ""nuclear destruction of Israel""?

Example: [One clarification by their supreme leader](https://twitter.com/Khamenei_tv/status/1264541220006739968) and here a [detailed look at this idiot's plans](https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/531366667377717248/photo/1)

# Example 5: Iranians want to kill Americans/destroy America

This is false. Iranians absolutely love Americans and America. Just try to find some post on reddit by Americans who travelled there. E.g. a Jewish-American redditor described it like being ""[treated like a rock star](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5602dt/i_am_a_jewishamerican_woman_who_just_traveled_to/)"". Here an[Article from the Atlantic with many sources](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/the-iran-we-dont-see-a-tour-of-the-country-where-people-love-americans/258166/) titled: A Tour of the Country Where People Love Americans

Why this misconception?

A group of crazies regularly meets and runs around screaming *Marg bar Āmrikā.* This gets literally translated as ""Death to America"", but it means just as much ""we want to kill Americans"" as how ""Fuck America"" tells people to have unconsentual sex with it or it's citizens. It's a typical ""lost ins translations"" example. In most official Iranian translations, the phrase is translated into English as the less crude ""Down with America"".

President Rouhani:

>If you go and ask anyone who uses that slogan \[...\] what he is against, it is interference in Iran's policies by overthrowing a nationally elected prime minister at the time of [Mossadegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh). For them, what they are against is the kind of government who shoots an airplane full of innocent passengers"" (referring to [Iran Air flight 655](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655), an Iranian airliner shot down by an American naval vessel). ""For them, it's not the people of America, per se. For them, they are opposed to that sort of policy, that sort of attitude, that sort of arrogance. It's not a nation. It's a system of behavior.""

Travel writer [Rick Steves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Steves) records a taxi driver in Tehran exclaiming ""Death to traffic!"" in English, explaining that ""when something frustrates us and we have no control over it, this is what we say"". Steves compares the phrase to non-literal use of the word [*damn*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn) in American English

Here is some background about the actual meeting:

> **Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”**  
But they also met Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.  
Nathan “of course, goes right over and opens the refrigerator because she’s like, ‘You can always tell where they’re from if you look in their refrigerator,’” Alefantis remembers. “It was perfectly clean, this refrigerator. There were just like eggs and vegetables. It turned out they had a big garden for themselves right there, and they were growing all their vegetables.”  
*“For some reason, the Cubans sell lots of cabbage. Cabbage, you think of it as Eastern European, but then it occurred to me: Russia! ... I don’t even know if I thought then about Russia bringing it to Cuba. You just keep thinking about these things.”*  
**Waters first met Nathan in 1987, when they both went on a gastronomic tour of the Soviet Union.** The tour was coordinated, they later learned, by a Lithuanian nationalist who regularly sent the esteemed group of American chefs and food writers to cooking schools while the organizer apparently stirred up trouble elsewhere. Nathan wasn’t daunted by the turn of events. As she always does before a major trip, she had researched the area and had a list of people to meet. She split from the group to conduct her interviews. By herself. 

**This is also an interesting piece of info on Nathan:**

She’s spoken to almost every important figure in 20th-century gastronomy and beyond, whether food writer M.F.K. Fisher or French chef Jean-Louis Palladin or Yotam Ottolenghi, the Israeli-born British chef. She’s close friends with Alice Waters, the chef and matriarch of the locavore movement.

**Alice Waters as I mentioned was already in the credits of Automatic at Sea produced on Martha's Vineyard**

Some context on the movie:

**Eve, while trying to escape the island, is trapped in bizarre visions. In one scene, she goes crazy with Peter's girlfriend, they make him wonder, which I won't show here to encourage you to see the film. In one of the last visions, before Eve goes crazy, Eve consumes a so-called ""secret pizza"" at night.**

**And if this is Alice Louise Waters, this is the same person who sent James Alefantis something marked ""Moloch Maschine"", it's hard to say what exactly this thing is, maybe it's about the movie, maybe it's about the music, I haven't seen anyone find information about what it's about \[ edit: found, it's probably about the movie Metropolis, James took the picture in such a way that you can only see the marking ""Moloch Maschine"" and this way you can identify that it's about the movie Metropolis\]**

**Moloch is obviously an idol associated with child sacrifice:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch)

>Moloch (/ˈmoʊlɒk/; Masoretic מֹלֶךְ mōlek; Ancient Greek: Μόλοχ, Latin: Moloch; also Molech or Molek) is a name or term that appears several times in the Hebrew Bible, primarily in the book of Leviticus. The Bible strongly condemns practices associated with Moloch, **which appear to have included child sacrifice**.

**Allan Gerson, Joan Nathan's husband and David Henry Gerson's father, hunted Nazis, so it is reasonable to suspect that he, like Joan, may have had connections in the intelligence community:**  
 

 [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/allan-gerson-dead.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/allan-gerson-dead.html)  


>His wife, a prominent cookbook author (her books include “Jewish Cooking in America,” published in 1994) and a longtime contributor to The New York Times, survives him. In addition to her and his daughter Daniela, he is survived by another daughter, Merissa Gerson; **a son, David**; two grandchildren; and a brother, Sam. Another brother, Eric, died of diphtheria in infancy during World War II.  
After Yale, Mr. Gerson joined the Justice Department in Washington as a trial lawyer in the newly created Office of Special Investigations. **His job was to track down Nazi collaborators — concentration camp guards, chiefs of auxiliary police and active fascist sympathizers** — who had succeeded in acquiring visas to the United States after the war by misrepresenting their roles in the Holocaust. Before it was disbanded in 2010, the office won rulings against more than 100 collaborators, many of whom were deported or extradited.  
 

**He was also ""a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who is credited with laying the practical groundwork for suing foreign governments for acts of terrorism.""**

 [https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Allan\_Gerson](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Allan_Gerson)  


>**Allan Gerson (born 1945) was a Washington DC attorney who is recognised as having engineered a practical basis for suing foreign governments for acts of terrorism.** After the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, Allan Gerson initiated the first civil suit against a foreign state (Libya) on behalf of families of the Lockerbie victims.\[1\] In 1996, Gerson was instrumental in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act which provides US citizens with the right to sue foreign governments in US courts for complicity in terrorism.\[2\] 

**What you should know about Joan Nathan is that she was an assistant to Teddy Kollek, the spy, mayor of Jerusalem and one of the most important founders of Israel, named after his father's friend Theodor Herzl.**

**This is interesting because James Alefantis and the aforementioned David Brock (his ex-boyfriend, previously mentioned here at event with Alice Waters, James and Tony Podesta at Pegasus) were invited to the home of Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who had sold Epstein's apartment at a low price so that Ghislaine Maxwell could live there and her pseudo-environmental organization TerraMarr could be temporarily based there. Lynn Forester de Rothschild also introduced Epstein to Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. Ghislaine Maxwell's father, on the other hand, was a KGB spy and suspected of being a Mossad spy.**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_Maxwell#Israeli\_controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell#Israeli_controversy)

> **Mossad allegations; Vanunu case**  
The Foreign Office suspected that Maxwell was a secret agent of a foreign government, possibly a double agent or a triple agent, and ""a thoroughly bad character and almost certainly financed by Russia"". **He had known links to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), to the Soviet KGB, and to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.**\[48\] Six serving and former heads of Israeli intelligence services attended Maxwell's funeral in Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir eulogised him and stated: ""He has done more for Israel than can today be told.""\[49\]

**Interestingly, Dershowitz claims he was introduced to Epstein through a mutual friend Lynn Forester de Rothschild, which took place on the island of Martha's Vineyard:**

> In his 2019 book, “Guilt by Accusation: The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of #[metoo](https://www.wykop.pl/tag/metoo),” Dershowitz offers a detailed rebuttal to Guiffre. He states that meeting Epstein was “just about the worst thing that ever happened to me.” **He was introduced to Epstein in late 1990s by their mutual friend Lynn Forester de Rothschild while vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard**.“I wish I had never laid eyes on him,” Dershowitz wrote. “I take full responsibility for becoming his acquaintance and lawyer, but I wish Rothschild had never asked me to meet him in the first place.”

But this recent trend of male sperm/testosterone levels dropping like crazy has me concerned. Something like a 59% decrease since the 1970s. Meaning a young person today has 59% less sperm and testosterone than somebody from the 70s. This to me screams red flags. 

Apparently the cause of this may be the use of certain chemicals and especially microplastics. If this trend continues we could very well become near infertile. Crazy thing is this problem isn't just showing up in us, it's also showing up in other animals as well although I imagine to a lesser decree. 

In order for society to function properly we need good birth rates to replace previous generations and we're failing to do this anyways but add in all these issues going on inside us it could very well get much worse. We're already seeing the results of this in Japan. 

Could these chemicals or the toxin in microplastics be intentional? Are we being purposely filled with chemicals and toxins that is resulting in depopulation or is it simply a consequence of our modern society? 

Not to judge anyone sexuality or what they chose to identify as. You be happy being you but it could very well be that the recent increased trend in folks being LGBT or transgender could very well be because males are lacking testosterone and therefore are less manly. We always make comparisons to men of the part and always look to the present and think how less masculine we've gotten as a whole. 

Anyways what do you folks think. Is this intentional?",conspiracy,Transgender

His parents insist that he should be treated as a girl, but star him in a reality T.V. show advertising to everyone on the planet that he is not a girl. If you’re wondering why this is a conspiracy, it’s because Jazz is part of an agenda to legitimize experiments on human children, who are obviously incapable of consenting to any experiments. With all that out of the way, here are some fun facts about Jazz:

* According to Jazz, when his mother got pregnant with him, she was convinced she would have a girl (http://time.com/4350574/jazz-jennings-transgender).

* Jazz’s parents “discovered” he had gender dysphoria because, before he could speak, he modified his clothes to “resemble” a dress (http://time.com/4350574/jazz-jennings-transgender).

* Jazz’s gender reassignment surgery (which was to be performed when he was 17) was complicated by the fact that, due to the puberty blockers he was given, his penis was so small that there was not enough tissue available (https://people.com/tv/jazz-jennings-talks-sexual-stuff-orgasm-libido-doctor-before-gender-confirmation-surgery). Jazz’s mother asked him not to talk about this, so as to not dissuade other depressed teenagers from being opted to get the same procedure. He had to lose 30 pounds because of this. [Still, it didn’t go well.] (http://imgs.fyi/img/77r6.jpg)

* Despite being 18, Jazz has almost no sex drive and his doctors believe he may now be physically incapable of orgasming (https://people.com/tv/jazz-jennings-talks-sexual-stuff-orgasm-libido-doctor-before-gender-confirmation-surgery).

Some of the families that lived there (or still do) include the Morgans, the Rockefellers, the DuPonts, and the Muellers.

Some members of the Gibson Island Club included Walter Rothschild and John Raskob (CEO of DuPont for decades - builder of the Empire State building.)

A number of the worst ideas of the 20th Century seem to come out of Gibson Island. Eugenics was a popular topic at the Science Conference held there from 1937 to 1947. Transgendered surgery was invented by some Johns Hopkins doctors who Summered of Gibson Island. 

A few characters from the JFK Assassination files can also be found there, as well as an early UFO false flag.

As far as Wikipedia's uselessness, whenever it says someone is not a Rothschild, it probably means that someone is a Rothschild.

She and her coach blamed her collapse on a deficit of oxygen due to the mask she’d been forced to wear, and state officials responded to the public outcry by easing their requirements for masks during athletic events.

https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/how-facebook-uses-fact-checking-to-suppress-scientific-truth/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&utm_medium=site%20buttons&utm_campaign=site%20buttons

But long before the pandemic began, scientists had repeatedly found that wearing a mask could lead to oxygen deprivation. Why had this risk been ignored?

One reason is that a new breed of censors has been stifling scientific debate about masks on social-media platforms. When Scott Atlas, a member of the Trump White House’s coronavirus task force, questioned the efficacy of masks last year, Twitter removed his tweet. When eminent scientists from Stanford and Harvard recently told Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that children should not be forced to wear masks, YouTube removed their video discussion from its platform. These acts of censorship were widely denounced, but the social-media science police remain undeterred, as I discovered when I recently wrote about the harms to children from wearing masks.

Facebook promptly slapped a label on the article: “Partly False Information. Checked by independent fact-checkers.” City Journal appealed the ruling, a process that turned out to be both futile and revealing. Facebook refused to remove the label, which still appears whenever the article is shared, but at least we got an inside look at the tactics that social-media companies and progressive groups use to distort science and public policy.

The “independent fact-checkers” of my article are affiliated with a nonprofit group called Science Feedback, which has partnered with Facebook in what it calls a “fight against misinformation.” The group describes itself as “nonpartisan,” a claim that I would label “Mostly False” after studying dozens of its fact-checks enforcing progressive orthodoxy on climate change and public health. I didn’t see anything that would have displeased the journalists and officials promoting lockdowns and mask mandates. Nor did I see anything that would have displeased a Democrat, particularly during the last presidential campaign. In October, when former President Donald Trump was predicting that a vaccine was imminent, the group labeled that prediction “Inaccurate” and proclaimed that “widespread Covid-19 vaccination is not expected before mid-2021.” (Fact check: The vaccine rollout began in December.)

An article was flagged because it cited a study by a team of researchers in Germany who established an online registry for thousands of parents to report on the impact of masks on their children. More than half of those who responded said that masks were giving their children headaches and making it difficult for them to concentrate. More than a third cited other problems, including malaise, impaired learning, drowsiness and fatigue. Apparently first hand accounts are “misinformation”....

The study passed peer review at a medical journal, Monthly Pediatrics, but it didn’t satisfy Facebook’s fact-checkers. Science Feedback labeled the study “Unsupported” on the grounds that it “cannot demonstrate a causal relationship between mask-wearing and these effects in children, due to limitations in its design.” The critique listed various limitations: The parents who responded to the registry were a self-selected sample; the parents couldn’t be sure if their children’s problems were due to masks or to something else; there was no control group of children who didn’t wear masks.

This is the same tactic used by the tobacco industry last century when epidemiologists observed high rates of lung cancer among people who reported a history of heavy smoking. The industry harped on the limitations of the studies — like their reliance on people’s self-reported history of smoking — and insisted that there was no proof that smoking caused cancer because no one had done a sufficiently rigorous controlled study.

Any study can be faulted for methodological shortcomings, but that doesn’t mean its results should be ignored or suppressed, particularly when the findings are consistent with a large body of evidence from other researchers. The mask problems reported by the German parents had been observed in dozens of previous experiments and observational studies, as another team of German researchers recently noted in a peer-reviewed article in the Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

https://archive.is/wip/Hb6HZ

After reviewing 65 scientific papers — original studies, literature reviews and meta-analyses — the researchers concluded there was statistically significant evidence of what they termed “Mask-Induced Exhaustion Syndrome.” This syndrome includes various physiological changes and subjective complaints: decrease in blood oxygen saturation; increase in blood carbon dioxide; increase in heart and respiratory rates; difficulty breathing; dizziness; headache; drowsiness; and decreased ability to concentrate and think. These risks were so well-known, the researchers noted, that many countries have occupational safety regulations limiting usage of masks. Germany, for instance, requires workers to take a half-hour break after wearing a cloth mask for two hours.

The fact-checkers at Science Feedback ignored all this evidence in reaching their conclusion that the German parents’ study was “unsupported and misleading.” Even worse, they themselves promoted a claim contradicted not only by the evidence, but also by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, which recommend against masks for children aged five and under because of concerns about safety.

The fact-checkers summarized their critique of the German study in a highlighted box labeled “Key Take Away,” which began, “Masks are safe for children over the age of two years to wear, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.” This pediatric association, known for its advocacy of progressive causes like allowing transgender youths to play in girls’ sports, had made that assertion on its Web site along with other questionable statements, like its advice to young athletes to wear a face mask during both training and competition. (Tell that to Maggie Williams and her coach.)

Why was this group’s opinion the “Key Take Away” regarding the safety of masks? It was grossly irresponsible — worse than “unsupported and misleading” — for the fact-checkers to ignore the peer-reviewed scientific literature in favor of evidence-free statements from a professional association.

In their paper, the German researchers explicitly acknowledged the limitations of their findings, noting that the children’s problems had been diagnosed not by doctors, but by a self-selected sample of parents. It noted these caveats, too, writing that the problems were reported by “parents who chose to respond” and reinforcing that point by adding, “not a random sample, obviously.” It also noted in the appeal to Facebook that the fact-checkers at Science Feedback had ignored scientific evidence in offering false reassurances about the safety of masks.

Facebook apparently made no effort to bring in a neutral arbiter for this appeal. It let Science Feedback be the final judge of its own fact-checking. They were notified by Science Feedback that its team had rejected the appeal, and the team’s justification was a blend of obfuscation and inaccuracies that would have been flagged by a competent editor or fact-checker.

“By stating that ‘the masks were giving their children health problems,’ your report gives readers the false impression that mask-wearing was identified as the cause of their problems,” the team wrote, deceptively omitting the first part of the sentence, which clearly stated that it was parents who blamed these problems on masks. Maybe Science Feedback wants to believe that these more than 10,000 parents were all mistaken about the cause of their children’s problems, but It didn’t misrepresent what the parents said.

The Science Feedback team also said, “Your article fails to offer evidence demonstrating that there have been ‘many complications from masks that other researchers have identified.’ ” 

That is entirely false. The article described a variety of physical, psychological and social complications, and cited supporting evidence from two medical journals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a court ruling in Germany and a lengthy article in City Journal on the scientific debate over masks. Science Feedback may prefer to believe that there are no complications from wearing masks, but it can’t truthfully be said that it failed to produce contrary evidence.

A study done by economists at the universities of Stockholm and Uppsala who had access to the medical records of the entire country’s population, compared the parents of senior-high-school students, who switched to online instruction, against those with younger students who kept going to school and did not wear masks in the classroom. There was little difference in the rates of COVID infections and serious cases. These results jibe with other evidence that schoolchildren are not significant spreaders of the virus, and also with evidence that places without mask mandates have fared no worse than places with the mandates. One could hardly ask for a more rigorous and thorough study: a nationwide natural experiment involving hundreds of thousands of parents.

But it wasn’t good enough for the fact-checkers at Science Feedback, who wrote: “Your article’s claim that ‘None of the children who kept going to school died of COVID’ and ‘The parents whose children kept going to school were slightly more likely to test positive for Covid, but no more likely to be treated or hospitalized for it’ rests on flawed reasoning. This makes it seem as if mask-wearing is implemented primarily to protect kids or parents from dying or getting hospitalized. But in reality it is used to limit the spread of the disease in the population, control the epidemic, and prevent the death of individuals at risk.”

To the extent that One can make any sense of this objection, it seems that the fact-checkers at Science Feedback believe that the unmasked schoolchildren were infecting large numbers of Swedish adults while miraculously leaving their own parents unscathed. An absurd notion and in no way supported by facts. “Fact checkers” can now make things up to fit their narrative and censor. 

The Science Feedback team never did identify an inaccurate fact in the article, but this exercise obviously wasn’t about accuracy. The fact-checkers were actually fact-blockers. Once it puts a warning label on a story, Facebook says that its News Feed algorithm “significantly reduces the number of people who see it,” and the platform can inflict further punishment by limiting distribution of other stories from that website and preventing it from advertising. The fact-blockers don’t even have to pretend to find an error. They can smear a journalist and blacklist a story by affixing a vague label like “Misleading” or “Missing Context.”

#Facebook is Shielded By Government Protections
 
Facebook enjoys immunity from legal liability because it claims to be a tech platform for others’ content, not a journalistic enterprise, but it and Science Feedback are acting like a publisher. They endorse sweeping claims for the efficacy and necessity of mask mandates and lockdowns — no need to quibble about the methodological flaws of that evidence — while making up excuses to suppress contrary findings. Instead of encouraging debate about the harms and benefits of these policies, they work to conceal the harms and pretend there is no scientific debate about the benefits.

Unfortunately, these tactics seem to be succeeding. Oregon’s young athletes may have gotten a reprieve from the mask mandate, but many others aren’t so lucky. They’re still wearing masks as they sprint down soccer fields. Little Leaguers still wear masks as they stand alone in the outfield. Four-year-olds still wear masks on the playground, and vaccinated teachers still teach classes of masked students. Facebook and Science Feedback are using their “fight against misinformation” as a weapon to spread their own version of it.

Yesterday I went nuts on a lady's social media (I just couldn't take it anymore) who was making a big fuss about the transgender/military issue and I started bringing up REAL points. She immediately labeled me as a conspiracy theorist and only addressed 1 of my 6 points and she assumed that I was attacking her as a person when I was actually just stating information. I never attacked her, I simply brought up some questionable media about Chester Bennington/Chris Cornell, Monsanto, missing children, the destruction of the 1st amendment right before our eyes, and the whole situation about Imran Awan. 

Is there any hope to make people think outside of the box anymore? I just wanted to plant a seed of thought in these people so that they wouldn't just follow the narrative and the BLATANT distractions. Everyone thought I was attacking her and I had to make it clear several times that I was simply stating information and NOT attacking her. Lmao everyone loved her reply to my comment basically labeling my entire comment as conspiracy and extremely disrespectful. They couldn't handle the stuff that I was throwing out at them. I basically told them that the trans/military stuff was a giant distraction and that we need to be focusing on more pressing issues and also not attacking each other, because that divides us.

Turns out, no matter what is right in front of them, they will only see what they want to see. Perhaps I am guilty of the same thing.",conspiracy,Transgender

You can find the transcript or the voice recording online too. Basically he talked about the New Order of Barbarians and things are already happening now.

Of course, depopulation. He said, surpressing sexual desires could backfire, so they wanted to increase it instead, to differentiate the idea of doing sex and producing babies by making everything sexual in movies/hollywoods, women to dress more provocatively,  porn made more available. They planned to have men relocating more for jobs so they wouldn't have thought of producing many children. 

Other things, they talked about :

- demise pill

- foods, not being able to grow our own vegetables (will be outlawed)

- study more specific subject while making sure you won't know the big picture because you won't be allowed to change studies easily, as well as making sure you won't have books (think: ebooks now and no phsyical books), and make it near impossible for you to access books about fields/information that isnt related to your own field/study (because it will be banned)

'No one can stay out of the approaching Storm': Putin's speech during the annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club

 The world is entering a decade of turmoil as the quest for a more just world order clashes with the arbitrary hegemony of the collective West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday during his speech. annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club. Putin's speech ranged from biodiversity to ""cancellation of culture"", the nature of what the West has to offer and Russia's response, followed by hours of questions from the audience. Here are six key points from his opening remarks. The West fuels conflict to preserve and impose its hegemony From inciting strife in Ukraine and provocations around Taiwan to destabilizing world food and energy markets, the US and its allies have been heightening tensions around the world in recent years and especially in recent months, Putin said. 

&#x200B;

 Ruling the world is what the so-called West bet on this game, which is certainly dangerous, bloody and – I would say – dirty. It denies the sovereignty of countries and peoples, their identity and uniqueness, and disregards any interests of other states,” explained the Russian president. In their so-called “rules-based world order”, only those who make the “rules” have any agency, while everyone else must simply obey.  However, the West “has no constructive ideas and positive development, they simply have nothing to offer the world except the preservation of their dominance”. 

&#x200B;

 Rules for you but not for me  

The West insists that its culture and worldview must be universal, Putin said. Although they don't say so openly, they behave as if these values ​​should be unconditionally accepted by everyone else.  However, when a few other countries, notably China, began to benefit from globalization, the West “immediately changed or completely canceled” many of the rules it had long insisted be set in stone and sacred, Putin said, such as free trade, economic openness, fair competition and even property rights “suddenly forgotten all at once, completely”.  “As soon as something becomes profitable for them, they change the rules immediately, on the go, as the game progresses.” 

&#x200B;

 “Culture of Cancellation”  

Believing themselves to be infallible, the \[psychopaths and lackeys\] rulers of the West wish to destroy – or “cancel” – those they dislike. Where the Nazis burned books, Western ""guardians of liberalism and progress"" now ban Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky, Putin said.  Liberal democracy has turned into something unrecognizable, declaring any alternative viewpoint either propaganda or a threat, he added. The so-called “cancel culture” destroys everything that is alive and creative, preventing any freedom of thought in culture, economy or politics.  “History, of course, will put everything in its place,” Putin said, adding that the presumption of those seeking to cancel them is out of the question, “but no one will remember their names in a few years, while Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky and Pushkin will endure”. 

&#x200B;

Russia does not seek domination

Russia is an ""independent and original civilization"" and ""has never considered itself an enemy of the West,"" Putin said. Since ancient times, it has ties to the West of traditional Christian and Muslim values, freedom, patriotism and a rich culture. There is another West, however – “an aggressive, cosmopolitan, neo-colonialist, acting as a tool of neoliberal elites,” Putin said, “whose dictates Russia will never accept.”

Even so, Russia is not playing a glove for the elites of that West, but “simply defends its right to exist and develop freely. At the same time, we ourselves are not looking to become some kind of new hegemon,” Putin said.

&#x200B;

Western hegemony is ending

“We are at a historic milestone, at the head of what is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and at the same time important decade since the end of the Second World War. The West is not capable of managing humanity on its own, but it is desperately trying to do so, and most peoples of the world no longer want to tolerate this,” Putin said.

The conflicts arising from this turmoil threaten all of humanity and resolving them constructively is the main challenge ahead, according to the Russian leader.

“No one can stay out of the coming storm,” which has taken on a global character, Putin said. Humanity has two options: “to continue to accumulate a burden of problems that will inevitably crush us all, or to try together to find solutions, however imperfect, but functional, capable of making our world safer and more stable”.

&#x200B;

What should the multipolar world be like?

In a truly democratic multipolar world, any society, culture and civilization must have the right to choose its own path and sociopolitical system. If the US and Europe have that right, so should all other countries and their peoples. Russia has that too, ""and no one will ever be able to dictate to our people what kind of society we should build and on what principles and values.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/genfr6ddckw91.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cfd2db69b360f2a1c0fb116f89fb0d0109c51b1a

The biggest threat to the \[Hospice of the\] West's political, economic and ideological monopoly is that alternative and fairer social models could emerge in the world – and would be more effective and more attractive \[than Western liberal rot offers\].

“Above all, we believe that the new world order must be based on law and justice, be free, authentic and fair,” said the Russian president.

“The future world order is forming before our eyes. And in this world order, we must listen to everyone, take into account all points of view, all nations, societies, cultures, all systems of worldviews, ideas and religious beliefs, without imposing a single truth on anyone, and only based on this, understanding our responsibility for the fate of our peoples and the planet, to build a symphony of human civilization.”

&#x200B;

Putin Reveals His Thoughts on “Gender Theory”

Western nations can live as they please as long as they do not impose their \[illnesses\] choices on others, believes the Russian president

All cultures in the world must be respected, including those that other nations may find strange, such as the gender-obsessed culture seen in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

“Respecting the peculiarities of peoples and civilizations is in everyone's interest. In fact, it is in the interest of the West as well. As it loses its superiority, it is rapidly becoming a minority,” said the Russian president during a speech on Thursday.

That said, Western culture should be respected like any other, Putin said.

If Western elites believe that they can incorporate into the minds of their people, of their societies, things that I personally find somewhat strange and that are apparently in vogue, such as dozens of genres and gay pride parades, so be it. Let them do what they want.

But the West has no right to impose its cultural preferences on other nations and societies, he said, adding that Russia does not lecture others on how they should live, nor does it want to be educated about it.

Putin declared that his country has chosen to maintain “traditional values” and went on to explain what he means by the term – not a universal set of rules, but many creeds that different societies have created for themselves.

&#x200B;

“The difference between them and the so-called neoliberal values ​​is that in all cases they are unique, because they are based on the traditions of a particular society, its culture and historical experience,” said the president.

That's why you can't force them on someone else. You must simply respect them, value what each nation has chosen for itself over the centuries.

The approach, Putin believes, is shared by most of humanity, contrary to what Western nations promote.

The remarks were part of a speech Putin gave at the Valdai Discussion Club, an international event hosted by Russia where senior Russian officials express ideas on global issues for other nations to discuss.

In his speech, Putin warned that the US and its allies are harming themselves by trying to force other nations to be more like them. Political and cultural diversity is critical to solving the problems facing humanity as a whole, he argued.",conspiracy,Transgender
84,We analyzed every QAnon post on Reddit. Here’s who QAnon supporters actually are.,52.0,95mrpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/95mrpl/we_analyzed_every_qanon_post_on_reddit_heres_who/,165.0,1533740580.0,"This is worth a read - if you are interested, there are a lot of pictures/data/charts/etc within the article.

https://www.vox.com/2018/8/8/17657800/qanon-reddit-conspiracy-data

Late on a recent Thursday night, a Reddit user posted a comment in a forum (or subreddit) devoted to the game Magic: The Gathering about how the company that makes the game is hiring with diversity in mind — and how that was ruining the quality of its cards.

Then he went to another subreddit, /r/TheRedPill, a men’s rights community known for its misogyny. He posted a comment saying our society lets gay and transgender people and women get away with sexual harassment.

His next stop is what’s most interesting.

He went to /r/greatawakening, the community that drives the QAnon conspiracy theory, a pro-Trump theory that posits that the president is at the center of a fight against a pedophilia ring run by Democrats. Enough of these people have shown up at Trump rallies wearing Q T-shirts — in reference to the persona at the core of this conspiracy theory — that a reporter had to ask White House press secretary Sarah Sanders whether President Donald Trump supported QAnon. (She dodged the question.)

The user we followed is deeply familiar with the culture of /r/greatawakening, because that’s where he’s been most active in recent months. And late that night, he went into a thread about the Clinton Foundation funding a pedophile ring and said he finds it “impossible to believe that this is all an elaborate hoax.”

It’s an outrageous claim, but it’s a core belief of QAnon conspiracy theorists. And it gets more outrageous: A key part of the QAnon narrative is that Donald Trump and Robert Mueller are working together to unearth a high-profile, Democrat-run pedophile ring.

This user’s late-night journey might sound like the meandering internet history of a lost, bigoted man.

But when we analyzed the participants of the /r/greatawakening — one of the main gathering places for QAnon supporters — we found that he’s a quintessential QAnon participant.

We were able to glean characteristics of this community by writing a computer program to analyze every single user who has commented on /r/greatawakening. From there, we looked at what other subreddits outside of /r/greatawakening these users participate in.

We found that most participants are relatively casual conspiracy theorists. Their interest in /r/greatawakening largely comes from their enthusiastic support for Trump. (There’s also a handful of Bernie Sanders supporters mixed in.) Their interests coalesce around things like video games, cryptocurrency, men’s rights, and martial arts. Although Reddit doesn’t ask for demographic data, it’s not a reach to say they are predominantly white men.

But here’s the kicker: An astoundingly small number of people produce the majority of the content. About 200 users account for a quarter of the forum’s comments. These people are clearly conspiracy theorists who believe they are investigators unearthing the truth, and they spend almost all their time on Reddit investigating these theories.

Another 700 users account for the next quarter of comments. The user we followed at the top of this story is among these people. They are active in /r/greatawakening but also spend time on other subreddits.

Nearly everyone else in the subreddit — the 11,000 commenters and 42,000 lurkers — are just along for the ride.

Who or what is Q?
But let’s take a step back: Who or what is Q?

Q is the mysterious persona who set this conspiracy theory in motion — someone who claims to have “Q-level” security clearance, which is how he can drop all these hints about the “true nature” of what’s happening in Washington. (Most commenters used the pronoun “he,” so we’re using that here.)

It’s tempting to speculate on who Q actually is. Many think there’s no one Q and it’s instead a group of people. Others think it’s John F. Kennedy Jr. A BuzzFeed report argues that it’s actually leftist trolls. But it could also be just a teenage dungeon master who thinks this is his magnum opus. No one really knows (though my bet is that it’s someone who’s not all that interesting).

This community, however, has turned an internet conspiracy theory into a live-action role-playing game. They are the main characters — except they don’t think it’s a game; they believe this conspiracy is real.

Who are QAnon supporters, according to their Reddit activity?
When we looked at the /r/greatawakening community as a whole, we found that the biggest overlap was with the pro-Trump community, /r/the_donald. The next biggest overlap was with /r/conspiracy, which has recently taken a pro-Trump bent.

There are many interesting nooks and crannies to this data set. For example, there’s overlap with men’s rights groups, gaming groups, cryptocurrency groups, and other conspiracy theory groups.

But there’s clearly a divide between hardcore QAnon users and everyone else.

Most people subscribed to /r/greatawakening don’t post anything. That’s in line with how most online communities work.

It’s the hardcore users who drive this conspiracy theory — and they believe it is their patriotic duty to investigate this conspiracy.

QAnon’s hardcore followers: the bakers
This conspiracy theory is compelling because of its participatory nature.

The QAnon conspiracy theory started when a 4chan poster — who said he had “Q-level” security clearance, and came to be known on 4chan and Reddit as “Q” — posted cryptic phrases and prompted people to investigate.

One of his first posts hinted that Hillary Clinton had been detained because Trump knew he had to remove “criminally rogue elements.” Q also told readers to follow former Clinton staffer Huma Abedin and to figure out why billionaire George Soros donated all his money recently.

Eventually, using Q’s hints, the community decided that the tumult of Donald Trump’s presidency was just a cover — that Trump, in fact, had everything under control. The users decided Trump was actually working with Mueller, instead of being investigated by him, to take down thousands of pedophiles. (My colleague Jane Coaston has a great explainer on this.)

But Q doesn’t say this outright. He only leaves “bread crumbs” for people to follow, and it’s the community’s job to piece them together. That’s why the subreddit’s users call themselves “bakers” — they’re pulling together the crumbs. Their investigation has led them to compare themselves to the Boston Globe reporters who reported on pedophile priests in the Catholic Church.

For most of these hardcore users, their Reddit activity circles around QAnon and other conspiracies.

They spend most of their time peddling conspiracy theories in politically oriented subreddits, including /r/politics. But they also spend time exploring other conspiracies in places like /r/MollieTibbetts, where redditors “investigate” the disappearance of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts.

Still, most of their time is spent on /r/greatawakening.

The top 200 commenters rarely post to other subreddits. About 80 percent of their comments are on /r/greatawakening and another 10 percent on /r/the_donald.

One user has posted more than 650 comments about QAnon. The user often takes “Q drops” and reposts them on /r/greatawakening, reaping a great amount of “karma” (Reddit’s points) along the way.

Another top commenter makes elaborate diagrams that look almost like caricatures of a conspiracy theorist’s diagram, but the community eats it up:

In other words, for all the attention they’ve gotten, there are relatively few people who seriously participate in this game.

QAnon’s less engaged commenters: the casuals
The user at the top of this piece is on the edge between a superuser and a casual user. But his Reddit activity falls more in line with the latter.

These casual users are what give QAnon its appearance of size and growth. They know the conspiracy theory, but they spend most of their time on other subreddits. QAnon is a side activity.

They scan as typical Trump supporters, with large overlaps in subreddit activity in /r/the_donald and /r/DrainTheSwamp. There is also a big overlap with /r/conspiracy, but on a per-account basis, only about one in 50 comments are on these conspiracy forums. (We only looked at users who posted between five and 30 comments in /r/greatawakening.)

In short, they aren’t a homogeneous group, other than their interest in Trump. They don’t all hang out in the same subreddits.

But there are some common themes in the subreddits they do hang out in:

When you look at this data, and dive into their comment histories, it’s hard not to think that many of these users profile as men who enjoy feeling like they know more than everyone else.

As one QAnon supporter told Vice, “It’s fun because we know before it’s going to happen a lot of times. Think of it: When things are happening, we got a smirk on our face — hehe — Q told us.”

The QAnon community is small, but it has powerful boosters who legitimize it
The core QAnon community is relatively small, and it would normally be a fringe conspiracy theory group that doesn’t get much attention outside the depths of internet forums. Even people like alt-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, who promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, has pushed back against QAnon. (Posobiec said he would debunk QAnon.)


But it has been thrust into the national spotlight because some prominent figures feed into the frenzy. It has gotten attention from celebrities like Roseanne Barr and former MLB pitcher Curt Schilling. It has also gotten huge bursts of attention via top conspiracy theorists Alex Jones and Sean Hannity. (Media Matters has a good rundown of all the people who have promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory.) In addition, Q supporters have shown up in decent numbers at Trump rallies and garnered quite a bit of media attention.

Sure, Q might be a leftist troll or a bored teenager. But the reality is that the president of the United States is not only prone to believing conspiracy theories but surrounds himself with people who peddle conspiracy theories. And he has used the office of the presidency to legitimize conspiracy theories and lies.

At a recent Trump rally, the president appeared to point at a family wearing Q T-shirts during a rally. To be clear, Trump could’ve been motioning to any number of things. But the gesture seemed to affirm to the QAnon community that Trump was in on this. “Never thought I would have hope restored like it is now. Its almost surreal,” one user posted on /r/greatawakening.

After all, if the president supports what you believe in, then how can it not be real?

Correction: We previously listed /t/TopMindsOfReddit as a conspiracy subreddit, but several users pointed out it’s actually about making fun of posts on subreddits like /r/greatawakening. This hints there’s some trolling happening from other subreddits.

The fact that they are pushing the transgender agenda is wicked enough.  But as shown from the company's Instagram account below, this clothing line and company glorifies death and overtly promotes Satanism and the ""New World Order"".

Here is an excellent article from Vigilant Citizen exposing this clothing line: https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/something-is-terribly-wrong-with-celine-dions-genderless-clothing-line/


The company's official website, with prominant images of skulls and clothing with skulls: https://www.nununuworld.com/


Here is the official Instagram of the clothing line: https://www.instagram.com/nununuworld/


If you scroll down the pictures on the Instagram account, you will see many disturbing images -- promoting the sexualization of children, many clothing items with skulls, shirts with the ""all-seeing eye"" of the Illuminati, children with goat's head masks on, etc.


Notable examples of disturbing images from their Instagram account....


Picture of a child with a skull shirt flashing ""666"" hand signs over the eyes -- the exact gesture used by many Illuminati celebrities in photographs for magazines:

T-shirts that say ""New Order""....as in ""New World Order"":

Shirt with the ""all-seeing"" eye of the Illuminati.  Also, on the pants is ""3-6"", which could be interpreted as ""three sixes"" or ""666"": https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf8UNx6HYaa/


Super wierd image of children with zebra masks, which alludes to masks worn by occultists and Satanists in rituals.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BojR5g1Hofp/


Extremely disturbing picture of a child with a skull super-imposed over her face, with the description ""Hidden desire"". I interpret this as...the hidden desire of this company is to destroy children: https://www.instagram.com/p/BLO560fDQja/


Extremely wicked picture of a child wearing a goat-head mask.  Of course, this is a reference to Baphomet and an overt endorsement of Satanism.  The caption of the picture is ""nununu inspiration"", meaning that this company is inspired by Satanism:

All major conspiracies are rooted in the ""New World Order"" agenda, which is the age-old Satanic conspiracy against God, and for the establishment of world Satanic conquest.",52.0,cfzpgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cfzpgt/a_synopsis_of_conspiracy_all_major_conspiracies/,104.0,1563720162.0,"The JFK assassination, Epstein and elite pedophile rings, deceptions by NASA, communism and enslaving the masses, the 9/11 false flag, the Sandy Hook hoax, harmful vaccines, the homosexual and transgender agendas and other perversion promoted by the Establishment, the Federal Reserve, etc.  

If you are new to all these conspiracies, you may be confused -- thinking ""are they all connected?"" and ""who is behind all of this?"".  Most long-time readers of this forum are aware of these facts.  But for those new to this information, the purpose of this post is to give you a very brief introduction and overview of the origin of all these conspiracies and the NWO agenda.

All of these major conspiracies are connected to one larger, central conspiracy -- the so-called ""New World Order"" conspiracy, or agenda for world Satanic conquest via a one-world government headed by the Luciferian elite.

The major secret societies that are at the center of the NWO conspiracy, such as the Freemasons and Illuminati, are worshipers of Lucifer.  They are soldiers of Satan.  Everything they do for the advancement of the agenda of Satan -- ie, to lead people away from God, promote the degeneracy and corruption of society, mass murder and harm human populations, gaining control of governments and other spheres of power in order to enslave and subjugate the people of the world, etc.

After recognizing that the NWO is a Satanic conspiracy, one of the next major steps in going down the rabbit hole is recognizing that jewish elite run the NWO agenda.  Elite jews created and run the communist movement, run Hollywood and the Establishment media, and run the big banks that control Western governments.  And why is this?  Because the religion called ""Judaism"" IS SATANISM.  It is not the Old Testament.  It is Babylonian occultism, based in the Talmud, and Kaballah.  The jews are a ""synagogue of Satan"" (Revelation 2:9) and ""of their father the devil"" (John 8:44).  Arguably the most famous Freemason in history, Albert Pike, admitted in his book ""Morals and Dogma"" (which is like a ""Bible"" to Freemasons) that the doctrines of the Illuminati and Freemasonry are based in the jewish Kaballah.",conspiracy,Transgender

Now we know UN and most Governments in democratic countries can force population control through some sort of a law. So they are sneakily trying to implement this Agenda using media and other resources.
Suddenly most of the progressive politicians want to give special treatment to other genders. Gender neutral washrooms, transgender people allowed to compete with born athletes in sports even combat sports, job reservation for LGBT, are just a beginning. They want to mainstream it so much that they can confuse young children into believing that they belong to some other gender and stop them from getting attracted to opposite gender. Than their next goal would be to let small children decide their genders. Already their is a niche demand for 'theybies' a word to define gender neutral babies. 
Hollywood elites are also supporting this Agenda by introducing LGBT characters as cool people. I think we see more characters representing LGBT people in movies and films than in real life. 
They are trying to ruin the institution of marriage by giving spouses gender biased laws. Divorce rates are alredy very high. This is already forcing many men to decide against getting married. They also want to give right to abort unborn babies so in case of a small doubt parents can easily abort a baby even if they might regret it in future. Pregnancy is already very stressful and mood swings can happen frequently this kind of power to take a life can easily ruin a happy marriage.
Fashion houses are also doing this gender fluid clothes to further progress the Agenda to remove gender identity and let same gender people marry so they cannot reproduce and increase population.

So In my opinion, UN Agenda to enforce population control is already in full swing and it is getting implemented so sneakily that most people aren't noticing it.",conspiracy,Transgender

 It should be 98.6 on the dot if you are healthy. 

If your resting body temperature is consistently lower than 98.6 it means you suffer from poor metabolic function. (Poor digestion). Poor digestion results in compromised immune function. This means you suffer from some degree of mental health issues as well like depression and anxiety , both are symptoms of underlying disease .

In order for food to be broken down and digested properly you need adequate bile and digestive enzymes . The organs responsible for digestion are the liver, gallbladder and pancreas.

If these organs aren’t functioning properly it means they are under some degree of inflammation . Inflammation is immune response to infection. It’s the body‘s natural defense mechanism to pathogens. 

The primary infections responsible for these issues are herpes family viruses like Epstein Barr , hhv 6 , herpes zoster (chicken pox ) , herpes simplex etc 
There is a wealth of peer reviewed clinical data showing these viruses direct involvement in a ton of different diseases like Alzheimer’s, autism, diabetes, ALS, M.S , arthritis , various cancers etc Look up the peer reviewed clinical data on legitimate medical websites like pub Med for reference . 

Without proper digestion your intestines become home to bacterial overgrowths, fungal infections, parasite infections. These issues are all secondary to the viral infections, they only occur in immunocompromised people. 

Factors that suppress immune function in order to let these viruses go systemic and chronic…

High stress and trauma - high stress suppresses immune function letting dormant viruses reactivate and disseminate. 

Toxin exposures - Our food is now loaded with toxins due to pesticide use and environmental pollution. Google the recent article on CNN regarding high levels of toxins like mercury, cadmium and lead found in baby food by the leading companies . 
These toxins as well as pesticides cause hormone problems, nervous system issues , and impaired immune response . 
Silver fillings containing elemental mercury are also a major contributor, elemental mercury is methylated in the body becoming methylmercury which easily passes blood brain barrier and tissues.
Toxin exposures play a major role in the growing number of gay, lesbian and transgender youth.

EMF/RF exposure - Electromagnetic frequency and radio frequency radiation impair nervous system function and cause the body to go into a state of artificial stress. 

Vaccinations - Vaccines contain additives that produce a major histamine response inside the body. Histamine makes regulatory T cells lose function. When this happens dormant viruses go active and can go systemic triggering a disease process . This is what causes autism. Child is born with viral infection passed on from mother , vaccine maker virus go active .

The regulatory agencies that are supposed to oversee these issues like the EPA, FDA, FCC etc are rife with corruption and conflict of interest scenarios .

Poor diet and sedentary lifestyle also play a part . 

The rate of chronic illness is higher than it’s ever been and it gets higher each year . 

Chronically ill women are giving birth to chronically ill children. The infections pass right along. No diseases are rooted in genetics, all disease is rooted in inflammation and infection. The rate of childhood illness has skyrocketed in the past 20 years. Diseases once reserved for the elderly are now becoming common place among children.

We have a for-profit healthcare system based on symptom management and drug dependency rather than prevention. The clinical data showing herpes family viruses involvement in a ton of different diseases goes back 40+ years but nothing has been done in terms of prevention measures like testing or public awareness .

Your health is the most important thing you have in this world, yet most people have little to know basic understanding of biology and pathology . Raise awareness.",conspiracy,Transgender

Disney has frozen hiring, limited employee travel and is also reviewing worker efficiency, with plans to introduce cutbacks as a way to make the company ""more nimble"". CEO Bob Chapek noted in a leaked memo to senior staff:

“As we work through this evaluation process, we will be looking at all avenues of operations and manpower to find savings and anticipate some staff reductions as part of this review.

…I am fully \[lack of\] aware that this will be a difficult process for many of you and your teams. We will have to make difficult and uncomfortable decisions.”

The ""awakened"" liberal Chapek mentions in the same memo the problem of ""macroeconomic factors"" beyond Disney's control. He doesn't mention, however, his habit of bending his knees and groveling to ""woke"" activists trying to sabotage the Florida government's anti-harassment legislation for public schools or the company's constant supply of content that promotes LGBTQ+, transgender narratives of the deranged. from the extreme left.

It's not so much ""macroeconomic factors beyond Disney's control"" that are causing the conglomerate's downfall. Rather, it's all factors in your control, including your refusal to produce the content your consumers really want.

American audiences have had enough of LGBTQ+ 'woke' liberal leftist propaganda in their movies and on television and are now actively researching and avoiding any content that promotes 'woke' ideology and 'social justice' talking points. After about five years of consumers holding their money and getting angry, Disney is finally starting to feel the pain.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jx2ukjsria0a1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d61d530c23561d9c5e1b00e3ca6ef54425a85bf

This is what happens when a company markets its wares to a small minority of deranged left-wing activists and LGBTQ+ bigots, many of whom have very little money to spend anyway.

Specifically, parents are concerned about Disney's ""family entertainment"" evolving to focus on LGBTQ+ characters, with LGBTQ+ concepts being purely sexual in nature and far beyond the understanding of the average child. Highlighting the dark sexuality of LGBTQ+ characters within a children's production is a bizarre and unhealthy notion.

In addition, the company's hostility toward Florida's Parents' Rights in Education bill, which makes it illegal for public school teachers to prepare young children with sexualized concepts and gender ideology, raises questions among consumers about the company's agenda. Disney in entertainment.

So it's no surprise that the company is now floundering, with a vast array of bombs from major box-office fiascoes in its politically motivated works, awake gender ideology, and streaming disasters that struggle to attract even a moderate audience. While they never openly admit it, ultimately Disney proves once again that ""waking up"" also means ""broke"".",conspiracy,Transgender

Fentanyl is the number one cause of death now. So CIA is trying to start a war in Bangladesh-Myanmar to farm opium.,40.0,ry65sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ry65sw/conspiracy_theory_elected_senators_dont_represent/,6.0,1641557912.0,"Sorry for bringing identity politics but there were subreddits and facebook groups where women criticized transgender women participating in women's sports. Big tech didn't like those groups so those were taken down.

There were facebook groups where women posted information about mRNA and even johnson and johnson vaccines causing miscarriages. Those were taken down.

There are two conspiracy theories here. One is that big tech helps big pharma and drug business. If a group of people try to spread awareness about drug business big tech does everything suppress them.

Second one is more probable, elected representative don't represent people. If people actually unite under an issue that can actually change things that triggers big tech and big pharma. So they are going to allow women's group as long as they actually avoid real issues like mRNA miscarriages. However, they are gonna censor all the women if they somehow figure out what's going on with eugenics and drug business. In short- they want people to remain dumb so they can signal virtue- hey we support people that you support. However if people somehow unites for economic reason aristocrats gonna stop signaling their virtue and show their real colors.

&#x200B;

Let me mention another eugenics and drug related conspiracy. After Afghanistan defeat, CIA is not getting enough opium to supply to big pharma. So right now the opium crisis is not opium crisis anymore, it has moved into a fentanyl crisis. 

Number one reason for young Americans death? Not cars, not covid, not guns, not opium, it's fentanyl. Fentanyl is dangerous and it kills. Some say it's because of chemistry. Some conspiracy theorists even claim that it is because China(a communist country) wants to kill all Americans so fentanyl is so dangerous right now. American big pharma were capitalist so they kept repeat customers rather than killing all drug addicts.  


USA sanctioned Myanmar because of rohinga genocide several years ago. But now USA is also blocking bank accounts of Bangladeshi military and paramilitary officials. Why? USA claims because of bad election, democratic process and corruption charges. 

However, conspiracy theorists suggest that CIA and big pharma is desperate to farm opium. Right now Seclaire dynasty are not getting opium money, China is getting all of fentanyl drug money. So big pharma wants to attack either Bangladesh or Myanmar, or both, in order to farm opium.

Search for Clinton wikileaks Myanmar nuclear.

According to wikileaks Hillary Clinton actually emailed people in 2010 that she thinks Myanmar is building nuclear weapons. It is possible that CIA starts another fake news gulf of tonkin or weapon of mass destruction to start wars in Bangladesh and Myanmar.

&#x200B;

summary: abolish the fed res bank, cia. 

pass a law that states big tech can't censor criticism of a company that they have invested in.

Now you cannot even say the word China without people screaming racist! Do they not see how idiotic this is, any sort of conversation about China is now off limits for some reason.

The same now is happening with vaccination if you have noticed, even more-so than the whole anti-vacc movement. If you mention the word vaccine people will begin to scream at you ""shut the hell up and stay home and take the damn vaccine they tell you take""

I believe there is a connection to excessive porn consumption and gender dysphoria. This is evident if you do even surface level digging into what transgender individuals themselves claim. Its very common to see trans people claiming that ""porn helped them realize they were a woman [or man]"". Often times this process of ""realization"" starts with the user imagining they are the sex opposite to them in the porn i.e. a man imagining he is the women in a porn video. Sometimes following this, is the introduction and obbsession with feminization or sissification hypno video. Anyone who watches or used to watch these videos attest to their suggestiibiltiy among users. 
In addition, porn is known to distort healthy sexuality due to its arousal cues. Porn rewires the brain to become aroused by certain cues, some of which are unnaturally ocurring in healthy sexuality. Most notably, men can become arroused by male genetalia since their brains are so used to seeing it along side the female in dopamine-flooding hetersexual porn. This helps to explain the interest that straight men have in watching tranny porn.
These are all ways in which porn can distort a persons sexual identity and thus be a primary cause of gender dysphoria aka transgenderism.
On a final note, I challenge anyone who denounces this theory to find a single trans person who doesnt or didnt watch an excessive amount of porn.",conspiracy,Transgender

Lyrics:

There's a lot of opinions floatin' around these days
And I got my own, ya know?
They may not be publicly acceptable
They may get me cancelled
But its my goddamn American right to speak 'em
And if you got a problem with that
Suck my dick

[Verse 1]
In a world made for the weak, the meek, the beta males, and the sheep
Too soft for the bait
If they don't agree then they just block and try to censor whatever you speak
Only like-minds on the timeline that they see
They anti-this and anti-that
So close-minded really, thеy just anti-facts
And you can show 'em the proof
But if it doesn't all align with thеir views that they've been programmed with from the news
Then they don't want to hear it
Or even fuckin' be near it
See the truth is too much for they spirit
That's why they fear it (pussy)
They try to tell me no, but fuck it, I'ma say it anyway
I've been waiting for the government to kill me any day
What the fuck? I'm not important enough?
**Must I talk about the vax, how they poisonin' us?**
Or the Vatican and all the little boys that they touch?
I'm not scared, shit it's not like I'm avoidin' this stuff
Yeah, the first amendment still lives on through me
And certain other motherfuckers who ain't on TV
We the last dinosaurs alive in AD
When we're gone, then you'll really know that freedom ain't free
But if everybody got to showin' some balls
These agendas they've pushing would be slowed to a crawl
But y'all so fucking soft, obeyin' and goin' along
Sitting there triggered over a song
I know the type
Got a black lives matter sign on the front porch
Never had a black person in the house
Yeah it's time to call 'em out
Virtue signal motherfuckers ain't about shit
They just runnin' at the mouth
With these preprogrammed points of view
And these ludicrous facts, Asian hate
Stop acting like you knew about that
If you need a safe space, there's some room in the back
With fresh vaginal wipes you can use while I rap
Pussy
Yeah, it helps 'em all sleep at night
Knowing they signed a petition for equal rights
For transgenders, talking like it's their fight
When in reality they never met one in their life
They don't donate, or actually do nothin' about it
They just sit there, sippin' Mountain Dew on they couches
While they clappin' for each other and circle-jerking themselves
Applaud the loss of freedom and cancel those who rebel
And I'm the bad guy 'cause I'm white and not gay
Which means that I'm a bigot and discredits what I say
But uh
I'd rather have some toxic masculinity
Than have an inner bitch in me bitch
So suck a dick or three
See, the algorithm's keeping you lost and now you're caught
In an echo chamber of your own thoughts
Let me talk while I can and speak to all my supporters
Before there's lawyers, threats, and gag orders
Cause nowadays that's the American way
With this false administration that has led us astray
They want the country to heal, but they don't spell with an A
What they mean is to obey and do whatever they say
But we tired of that
So when I'm here to rap
I got a duty to the people to bring light to the facts
Never see a day I'm taking it back
If I gave a shit then I'd use a mask, for wiping my ass
And when it comes to the shot, I don't care if you got it
Why you care if I didn't? I'm not understanding the logic
Shit, it's such a hot topic, you can get 'em in malls
""I just got my eighth booster"", fuckin' round of applause
People scared to say it so they just say nothing instead
So let me make myself clear so they don't twist what I said
Hell yeah I'll get the shot, with a gun to my head
After they pull the trigger and they vaccinate me dead
[Chorus]
Raw thoughts
(And I ain't no Democrat
I ain't no fuckin' Republican either)
These motherfuckin' raw thoughts
(I'm a free-thinking citizen of the United States of America, goddamn it)
Raw thoughts
(And I've been seeing where this world's going
Where this country's goin' and it makes me sick)
These motherfuckin' raw thoughts
(Fuck the new world order
Take that vaccine and shove it up your ass)
Raw thou...

[Bridge]
Oh, y'all thought I was done?
Hell no, this is raw thoughts
You know how we do
Line these motherfuckers up
It's time to get to work

[Verse 2]
Where should I start, Joe Biden I guess
Old yeller
Shit, I'm honestly surprised he hasn't died on us yet
You ain't our president, dog
Shit, you don't have to pretend
Come on Joe, we all know that you ain't actually win
Yeah, them puppet strings holding you up, weekend at Bernie's
Dementia really slowin' you up, should we be worried?
You're trippin' up stairs, then you're sniffin' on hair
Someone go and get this geriatric man a wheelchair
And then you got a son makin' lots of loot
From the Ukraine, who blew it on prostitutes
So I snort a line of crack rock off the protective case up on Hunter Biden's laptop
So I'm typing in capslock, like
Hi Fauci, I seen that mail leak dog
Better get a better anti-virus call the Geek Squad
The king of backtracks
Last time I seen that many wrong numbers was me when I failed math class
And Jen Psaki, I'm gettin' sick of that lying twat
Fire crotch
Always trying tell me they'll require shots
But if it's shots that they want, I'll let 'em have it
If they knocking on my door, checkin' my vaccine status
Andrew Cuomo
Grabbin' asses like the old days
Still had time to kill more old people than old age
We all hate you, judge, and defame you
I speak for all Italians: We don't claim you (fuck 'em)
Rejected Rachel Maddow with a fatal strain of mad cow
Walked her up a massive flight of steps and kicked her back down
Seein' news come out
Make me wanna smack the dick right out of Anderson Cooper's mouth
So ask your senator, pass me the Astrazeneca
Vax your relatives, dad, go and jab your stepmother
Rapid testing your ass
When you have a temperature, shit
We gone nuts, don't vax the messenger
Like Kamala Harris and Guantanamo barracks
She's incarcerated so many people
I think it merits, leaving her there to rot
She deserving of it either way
Just be sure you don't forget to go and throw the key away
And you call me insane
But Ted Cruz has actually growin' on me
Wait, let me explain
Shot wise, he's been freedom of choice
While also fighting for the first amendment
Which I need for my voice to get out
So no matter how bad that I want to hate
I give credit where its due, I know its a hot take
But before I'm off the subject, wait, you still ugly
Shit, Arya Stark won't even wear your face
I'll impregnate Melinda Gates
She said my dick was great
I said ""shut up bitch
Get back in the kitchen, fill my dinner plate""
Then I liquidated Bill's estate
Blew their house up with them in it, let 'em incinerate
Gathered up their ashes and slipped 'em into some vaxes
The FDA approved and shipped it off to the masses
Had some side effects, but they ain't worried about that shit
Long as I ain't tell no one and pay my taxes
Get your vaccine, shoot up like 15
And don't forget to go collect your free Krispy Kreme
Go and get tested for fun to get a swab high
Cause there's nothin' quite like huffin' ethanol oxide
And Zuckerberg will try to censor my words
Jack Dorsey shadow banning, this revenge of the nerds
New rules, tryin' to regulate life as it was
More mandates than gay night at the club
So I'm sorry that I had to come and stop the show
Before we all need a motherfuckin' shot to go
Anyway, so someone had to come an rock the boat
And say shit that even Tom MacDonald won't
And I'm just one guy with the balls to say what I see
Even if I sound off a ways
All I know is that we're way too lost to save
At this point, I could write a Raw Thoughts a day
Shit, but these are my opinions
And I'm allowed to speak 'em
You wanna get the shot?
Do you, it's called freedom
You don't? Then you don't
Stop forcing vaccinin'
Cause to me, that's like pushin' pork belly on a vegan
I mean it
Disagree with my views, that's all fine
I respect you for yours, respect me for mine
We don't gotta draw a line in the sand or nothin'
Just respect a motherfucker that'll stand for something
So keep watching the news and keep trusting the numbers
I'll keep digging for truth and tell 'em what I discover
As they cancel motherfuckers just for raisin' they hand
I'll pull my megaphone out and get to takin' a stand

[Jennifer...](https://imgur.com/wwx7hfa)

is a male-to-female transgender who served in the US military. She is a member of the [Pritzker family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family), heirs to the [Hyatt Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt).  They use their estimated $29 billion dollar fortune to speculate on the  stock market, dodge taxes, buy politicians, and rip people off with  predatory banking schemes.

**Brief Pritzker Family Background**

Over  a dozen years ago, Gus Russo, an investigative journalist nominated for  a 1998 Pulitzer Prize and former lead reporter for the award-winning  PBS Frontline series, published a pair of massive volumes on the history  of organized crime; ""The Outfit"" in 2001 discussing Chicago and  ""Supermob"" in 2006 dealing with California. By the 1990s  declassification of a vast quantity of government documents, including  FBI wiretaps and Congressional files, allowed Russo access to this  previously unavailable material. An early introductory summery in  ""Supermob"" is reproduced below:

>Two  types of power dominated the twentieth century: the visible, embodied  in politicians, corporate moguls, crime bosses, and law enforcement; and  the invisible, concentrated in the hands of a few power brokers  generally of Eastern European and Jewish immigrant heritage. Operating  safely in the shadows, these men often pulled the strings of the visible  power brokers. Although they remained nameless to the public, they were  notorious among a smattering of enterprising investigators who, over  decades, followed their brilliant, amoral, and frequently criminal  careers. The late Senate investigator and author Walter Sheridan dubbed  them the Supermob.

Many  dozens of the pages of Russo’s book document the underworld  associations of several generations of Pritzkers, which began not long  after the [founding father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nicholas_Pritzker)  opened his Chicago law firm in 1902. The enormously diversified current  assets of the Pritzker family are listed in Russo’s Appendix B, which  occupies nearly six full pages, and the Pritzkers today remain one of  the wealthiest families in the USA, with total assets of nearly $30  billion, and an enormous record of involvement in recent politics.

**The Pritzker Family Today**

The Pritzkers are heavily invested in the world of pharmaceuticals and science. Through the [Tawani Foundation](http://www.tawanifoundation.org/), [Jennifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Pritzker)  has been able to corrupt and influence the direction of the ACLU,  various military academies, medical institutions (including for  children) and universities.

Other  members of the Pritzker family donated $25 million to University of  California at San Francisco’s child health department, which under the  auspices of two Jews, predictably advocates for confused or ill young  children to be given irreversible transsexual surgeries.

This  money guarantees, in the very best case scenario, a veto on science  that questions the validity of transgenderism, but often times just  incentivizes these universities to produce pseudo-science in favor of  it. UMN has a whole clinic dedicated to advocating in favor of and  entertaining transgender insanity, targeting kids in particular

The  ridiculous “controversy” over whether the military should allow  transgenders is another product of Pritzker money. It is hard to believe  that retired and current military men think it is important to include  transsexuals in the armed forces, but 10s of millions of dollars can get  many of these careerists “woke.”

[Jennifer Pritzker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Jennifer_Pritzker.jpg)  is a life-long GOP donor, but the billionaire last year decried its  “marginalization” at the hands of the Trump administration’s “rhetoric.”  In its op-ed, Pritzker demands the GOP go back to focusing on low taxes  for billionaires and defer to “experts” on issues like transgenderism –  presumably the “experts” [Jennifer](https://illinoisfamilyaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JenniferPritzker-1.png) personally funds to say what it thinks.

The  Pritzker family is intimately involved with the Democratic  establishment, especially in their home city of Chicago where they enjoy  close ties to the Israeli [Rahm Emanuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel)  and Barack Obama.This family was very influential in Washington during  the Obama years, where the Pritzkers, through bundling and personal  donations, were able to collect $800 million dollars for Obama’s  campaigns and inaugural funds.

Obama’s  administration was important in using federal power to impose  transgenderism in the public space, with pushes to integrate  transsexuals into the military, creating “gender neutral” bathrooms in  public schools and facilities, and increasing state funding to groups  like the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds pro-transsexual activist  groups. [Penny Pritzker’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker)  close relationship to Obama led to the government looking away as her  and her family cheated the estate’s tax system, paying $9 million on  their inheritances rather than the $150 million they should’ve owed.

Obama  in 2013 appointed his handler Penny Pritzker, who ran his campaign’s  finance wing in ’08 and chaired his campaign in ’12, to oversee his  Department of Commerce, which allowed her to set the terms and  priorities on new government initiatives like NIMBL, a program that  allocates R&D grants for research on biopharmaceuticals.

Like  Jennifer, Penny’s private “philanthropy” is obsessed with influencing  what children are taught as well as the university system. Her Pritzker  Traubert Family Foundation has funneled millions into Harvard’s Medical  School, which has purchased her a spot as a member of the Harvard  Corporation. Harvard is known for institutionalizing an extreme form of  gender ideology that it submerges future elites in.

Penny’s brother, fellow billionaire and [Governor J.B. Pritzker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker),  has turned the state Illinois into a free for all, often with a tranny  bent. He has signed executive orders and bills on immigration that ban  local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE to deport criminal  aliens, give wide swaths of Illinois’ illegal immigrant population  amnesty, and developed a special incentive program for illegal and  transgender students to receive public grants from the Monetary Award  Program.

Governor Pritzker has  also signed an executive order giving transgender and “non-binary”  students special privileges in school, along with free access to an  arsenal of lawyers that effectively controls the direction of sexual  education and erases the First Amendment rights of fellow students.

The  Pritzkers are only one, relatively small branch of America’s hereditary  plutocracy. If you’re wondering why Presidential candidates like **Elizabeth Warren** or Great Wall Street Hope **Pete Buttigieg** have made the absurdity of transgenderism front and center in their campaigns, it’s because the Pritzkers are paying them to.

before you start bashing me for being homophobic, let me just say that I've always been friends with people who are gay and trans. We do watch Ru Paul's race sometimes for entertainment, and find it hilarious. But even some of my gay friends agree this is a bit far. How can a boy classify himself as a girl at only 8 years old? He hasn't even reached puberty, gender identification should be the least of his concerns. It feels like the childhood becomes shorter and shorter for each generation, kids are greatly encouraged to act like adults. 
Some parents said he's just playing dress up, its harmless. But he's also adapting the mannerism, and already his lifestyle is that of a drag queen. 

EDIT: I do understand that a drag queen doesn't necessary mean transgender, it's just a look/personality people like to adapt, not their sexual orientation. But how can a child understand all these complex definitions and their differences?",conspiracy,Transgender

8:10 - A feminist passed by and asked me why I didn't make a snow woman.

8:17 - My feminist neighbor complained about the snow woman's voluptuous chest saying it objectified snow women everywhere.

&#x200B;

8:25 - The vegans at the end of the lane complained about the carrot nose, as veggies are food and not to decorate snow figures with.

&#x200B;

8:28 - I was being called a racist because the snow couple is white.

Like us cheering on the deaths of people who got covid vaccines and who didn’t. Same with masks or anything. Nobody deserved it. Check your extremity. This is what happens when we are brainwashed into thinking we the people are each others enemies. We just don’t fucking like each other and don’t want to live with each other because it’s hard. It’s like growing up in a shitty family home, we aren’t our enemies. It just seems like it some days. I wish we all realized this. 

The enemy would have to be the ones manipulating all of this. The individuals making millions off of us as we die and suffer as they do things like, orchestrate a fight over the right to murder a 9 month old fetus; who is a fully developed baby and gaslight the US into thinking it’s empathetic to “give a woman her rights”. Give a woman her rights, not a license to kill. 9 months is far past time for an abortion. Rights aren’t being taken away at that point, except from the fully formed human being killed and even potentially left alive on ice for days. Give a woman her choice and a appropriate time window. The only issue is fabricated by virtue signaling at the public with divisive and distracting language, over shadowing the real points that need to wildly be understood and discussed. “Taking a woman’s rights away is a lie”. 

Aslo transgenders make up like 3% of our population. The fact that we are ALL involved in these conversations show that it is all political scams. One after another. (And the same ones repeated mostly) Dylan whatever is apart of scam, not a movement. That is not the face of transgenders. That’s just another problem for them. 

Also black lives don’t matter to them. That’s why they only do during political season. Dissect that. There is concrete evidence that joe Biden is a racist. A lot of it too. You can’t not compile that stuff the same way with trump. But look at how the media spun that, while further making race an issue and keeping threads of racism alive in our country to later use for public manipulation, to then use for votes. 

This post shifted into something else pretty quick, but it really didn’t. The media is a huge fucking problem and this global gaslighting thing needs intervention. This is (I mean mostly) a joke now, but when the aliens do come, it’s just gonna be more of this same shit. Just another moon landing or 9/11.  Both of which at this point actually do seem fake.

115,Any Interesting Theories/Resources Regarding the Rise in Rates of Transgenderism?,29.0,l4232n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/l4232n/any_interesting_theoriesresources_regarding_the/,43.0,1611504248.0,"Hello r/conspiracy community. I've lurked a while, but with subreddits even allowing conversation in the following topic becoming rarer and rarer, I figured I would finally post here.  

I was wondering if anyone might have some interesting links or literature covering theories into the rising rates of transgenderism. 

All I can provide is the anecdotal evidence that prompted me to post this. 

My girlfriend's 15 year-old son came out as transgender about a month ago. Not a problem, and everyone has been as understanding as possible. In him/her opening up about the situation, he/she noted that ""there's like, more than 20 people in my class that identify (as transgender)"". This in a class of > 300 students, or almost 8%. This, as far as I know, also does not include kids who identify as gay or bisexual. 

This got me thinking back to my high school, and my graduating class (class of 1999). Out of 200 students, we had 5 we knew were gay, and zero that were openly transgender. Not the greatest sample size, so I acknowledge there is room for error. Now, given that it was 1999, the argument could be made that society was a lot more closed off. But 20 years later, through class reunions, social media, etc., one additional person came out as gay, and the one person who an incredibly butch lesbian now identifies as a man - which came as a surprise to no one. So in 20 years - we've had massive amounts of social progress, but the numbers essentially haven't changed. 

Recently, I was speaking with a family friend about this who works as a counselor, including many kids and teenagers as clients. In a very hushed tone, she said ""there is an epidemic of sexual confusion in children these days"". I'll try and get a little clarification on this statement, because it seems to go against the narrative that it's ""completely natural"". 

I've heard a number of theories for the increase, including that it's been more normalized now, or it's ""cliquey"" and ""trendy"", but neither of those feel like they should account for the large increase over 20 years, or be a reason for a psychologist to label it an ""epidemic"". 

So I was curious what this sub thought, or if there were some prevailing theories that explain the apparent rise in rates. And again, I apologise if it's a little off topic for this sub, but trying to discuss this issue outside of the mainstream talking points is a no-go on most of reddit.",conspiracy,Transgender

Keep enough in the bank to pay your bills and no more.

2. Turn off all mainstream media. Control of mass media is the key to the Bolshevik strategy for command and control. Only listen to networks and visit websites like the Republic Broadcasting Network, [Rense.com](https://Rense.com), Steve Quayle, Stan and Holly Deyo and Genesis Communication. Do not watch network news unless you are viewing it as a way to determine what the enemy is up to. Apply the same logic to your local newspaper as they are all owned by Gannett Broadcasting. Most of your radio stations are owned by Clear Channel and they all have the same globalist propaganda.

3. Get your children out of the government schools with their NWO Common Core curriculum along with their zero tolerance policies and transgender restrooms.

4. Never a borrower or a lender be. We are now a nation of debt slaves. Pay cash for everything. If you cannot pay cash, then you do not buy it! Own your future instead of the banksters owning you.

5. Service your car at the local garage and do not use the car dealer’s mechanics.

6. Stay out of Walmart, Kmart and every other slavemart. Shop at your locally owned store and stay out of the chain stores they are all owned by the enemies of humanity (e.g. Walmart slave labor).

7. Dine out at your “mom and pop” stores. Stay out of the corporate chains as you are only feeding the NWO beast.

8. Buy gold and do not hoard cash. This cuts into the power the NWO bankers have over you and your country.

&#x200B;

9. Never vote for the incumbent. The longer the power hungry are in power, the more likely they are to be on the take.

10. Store food and water. Buy privately sold guns and bury them so you have them following the coming gun confiscations. You will need them to protect your food and water.

&#x200B;

11. Try, as hard as it might be, to buy only Made In America products.

&#x200B;

12. Make a registry at your local community mail box of which you list the trades and skills possessed by your neighbors so you can trade craft favors. Also, sell your products in the same manner. Trade and barter and get out of the habit of using credit and debit cards as well as cash. This will minimize your tax bill. There are laws being passed against these practices. Ignore these laws. Starve the Federal Reserve beast.

&#x200B;

13. Educate your neighbors, family and friends that this government is controlled by those who would do you harm.

&#x200B;

14. Have an escape plan. When the roundups start you will need a place to hide out for about six months.

&#x200B;

15. Grow your own food and try to conceal that fact as much as possible. Encourage your neighbors to do the same so you are not murdering each other on the fourth day following the coming currency collapse.

&#x200B;

16. Eat organic and avoid GMOs. Exercise, read and take vitamins. Meditate before starting each day.

How to Defeat the NWO Once and For All

&#x200B;

We cannot defeat the NWO at this time because they are us. Yes, they are indeed evil personified, but they represent everything that is also wrong with us. All of us are the NWO, and if we want to not be the NWO we need to stop acting like them. Every time we cheat on our spouses, we are no different than Jon Corzine who cheated investors out of 1.2 billion dollars of secured investment accounts in MF Global. Every time we spread malicious rumors and lies about another human being, we are no different than what Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch do with CNN and FOX on a daily basis.

117,Observations on /r/Conspiracy,28.0,87dqzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/87dqzn/observations_on_rconspiracy/,14.0,1522106919.0,"This is just a few loose thoughts that I've gathered in my time on this sub, that I would like to start a sort of meta-conversation about.

1. **""The Left-Right divide is meaningless.""**

     This is true in general in areas of maybe foreign policy (Trump compared to Obama compared to Bush compared to Clinton and so on differ around the edges but have all continued / sustained / started wars in their own ways) and a couple others, but the two parties are not the same. Democrats want gun control, right? Does that mean they're the same as Republicans, or different? Republicans want transgender bathroom laws. Just like Democrats, right? Those are *real* issues. You can't act like voting for one party over the other doesn't matter when they differ on significant issues. They don't differ enough on every single important issue, but they do on enough of them that it still matters who you vote for.

2. **""This sub is being brigaded by /r/Politics / /r/The_Donald.""**

     Sometimes people disagree with you. Conspiracies aren't committed solely by Democrats or Republicans, and conspiracy theories aren't imagined solely by Democrats or Republicans. ""George Bush did 9/11"" and ""Obama is the antichrist"" aren't usually two thoughts held by the exact same group of people. 

     When you see something you disagree upvoted to the top of a thread in /r/Conspiracy, it is *not* proof that the subreddit is being brigaded. I mean, it's proof of ""something"", but not necessarily ""brigade"". Sometimes people disagree with you. Sometimes it just happens that there are more Trump supporters here than usual. Sometimes there's fewer. It's not just because it's a coordinated attack. Sometimes Trump does something embarassing and his supporters get off reddit and the majority of people left are left wingers who upvote left wing stuff.

3. **""You're clearly a [ correct the record, internet research agency, share blue, russian, koch brothers, soros-funded ] shill.""**

     There are shills on reddit. But, there are also people that disagree with you. Maybe the person you're arguing with really is a shill, but nothing productive comes from just tossing that accusation around. 

     Also, calling somebody who has been arguing with you for several comments in a row a ""bot"" is borderline stupid. Nobody is writing bots smart enough to have actual conversations. The ""bots"" are more likely to be the comments that throw out one highly controversial statement and then don't respond to anybody that challenges them (because they're bots, they wouldn't know how). 

4. **""If you don't believe my conspiracy theory / if you poke holes in my theory, you're not truly part of this community.""**

     I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like watching documentaries where people talk about stuff like the real meaning behind the pyramids, where Hitler disappeared to after they faked his death, who really shot JFK, etc. I don't believe 99% of the theories I read about those things. In fact, since most of the conspiracy theories about those events contradict each other, you'd have to be literally insane to believe probably any two of them. However, of course I still enjoy reading them. It's like a fun ""what if"" type thing.

     I also believe in certain, um, ""more serious"", conspiracy theories. Like ones involving corporations dividing the world up into fiefdoms they can control and extract money from.

     I think the earth is round. I'd still like to read your theory on why it's not. But the second you call me a ""shill for round earth"" of course I'm going to downvote your comment.

5. **""The downvotes prove how right I am.""**

     I mean, this is just stupid on its face. It's the rallying cry of idiots who've already lost the argument. Now, of course, there *are* times where the person who is correct is being downvoted. But there's also times where the person who's *incorrect* is being downvoted. So no, downvotes aren't proof of anything.

6. **""If the mainstream media is saying it, obviously the opposite is true.""**

     Even if you believe the media coordinates its messaging in order to mislead the public, it'd be silly to think literally everything they said is exactly 100% wrong. They would lie by outright lying sometimes, omission of truth other times, selective truth sometimes, and sometimes they'd just tell you the actual truth because the truth fits with what they want you to think anyway. If the mainstream media comes out and says something negative about the politician you like, you can't assume that just because they said it it's automatically not true. 

     By the way, you interested in a *real* conspiracy? The term ""mainstream media"" is a marketing ploy developed by the conservative media to paint themselves as the ""truth telling underdogs"" in a world dominated by the ""liberal media"", while those same conservative media figures constantly talk about how *they are the most watched and listened to*. Ben Shapiro claims to have the most listened podcast behind Oprah. Fox News claims to be the most watched cable news network. Rush Limbaugh claims to be the most listened to radio talk show host. But at the same time, they all claim to be the underdogs compared to the ""liberal media"". It's a marketing ploy. It's one media company, telling you not to patronize the other media company. Mar-ket-ing. Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, whoever, these people exist to get you to listen to their shows more, so that you'll listen to the commercials that air during their show, so you'll buy more bullshit, so those companies will pay them more money. That's it. They don't like you. They don't give a shit about your life. 

     Dude if Pepsi walked up to you and said, ""don't believe the lives of the mainstream soda company (((coke))), we're clearly the superior brand"" you'd laugh in their faces. But when your media company you prefer says it, you adopt their corporate advertising logo into your own vocabulary. Gross.",conspiracy,Transgender

A medical operation or even hormonal meds prescribed to alter (I personally prefer ""damage"" or ""mutilate"") someone's reproductive system is clearly unethical, and yet this has become prevalent in developed countries.

Since most transgenders are mtf (male-to-female) anyways, could this be an attempt to coerce emotionally unstable/mentally ill & potentially ""dangerous"" (i.e. capable of causing social unrest by random acts of violence, but tbh anyone who could purchase a gun can do that) into chemical castration/self-harm?

This is a scam even from a social science point of view since socialization (gender stereotypes & so forth) is by no means a perfect brainwashing machine; otherwise, where do tomboys come from?

>His wife, a prominent cookbook author (her books include “Jewish Cooking in America,” published in 1994) and a longtime contributor to The New York Times, survives him. In addition to her and his daughter Daniela, he is survived by another daughter, Merissa Gerson; **a son, David**; two grandchildren; and a brother, Sam. Another brother, Eric, died of diphtheria in infancy during World War II.  
After Yale, Mr. Gerson joined the Justice Department in Washington as a trial lawyer in the newly created Office of Special Investigations. **His job was to track down Nazi collaborators — concentration camp guards, chiefs of auxiliary police and active fascist sympathizers** — who had succeeded in acquiring visas to the United States after the war by misrepresenting their roles in the Holocaust. Before it was disbanded in 2010, the office won rulings against more than 100 collaborators, many of whom were deported or extradited.

**He also was ""a Washington DC attorney who is recognised as having engineered a practical basis for suing foreign governments for acts of terrorism."":**

**So you may ask, what this ""cooking"" stuff and ""Jewish"" stuff has to do with Obama/James Alefantis visit on Cuba.

**Continuing ->**

>Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur **James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”**  
But they also met Paolo Titolo, husband of Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and director of the country’s National Center for Sex Education. Titolo is an Italian photographer known for shooting members of Cuba’s transgender communities. Titolo took Nathan and Alefantis to a shantytown where they stopped at a shack with a corrugated metal roof, home to a local drag queen who makes dresses for young girls to wear to their quinceañera celebrations. Titolo told the Americans they would have to be discreet at the home.  
Nathan “of course, goes right over and opens the refrigerator because she’s like, ‘You can always tell where they’re from if you look in their refrigerator,’ ” Alefantis remembers. “It was perfectly clean, this refrigerator. There were just like eggs and vegetables. It turned out they had a big garden for themselves right there, and they were growing all their vegetables.”  
*“For some reason, the Cubans sell lots of cabbage. Cabbage, you think of it as Eastern European, but then it occurred to me: Russia! . . . I don’t even know if I thought then about Russia bringing it to Cuba. You just keep thinking about these things.”*  
**Waters first met Nathan in 1987, when they both went on a gastronomic tour of the Soviet Union.** The tour was coordinated, they later learned, by a Lithuanian nationalist who regularly sent the esteemed group of American chefs and food writers to cooking schools while the organizer apparently stirred up trouble elsewhere. Nathan wasn’t daunted by the turn of events. As she always does before a major trip, she had researched the area and had a list of people to meet. She split from the group to conduct her interviews. By herself.

**Here's also interesting part about Nathan:**

[https://i.imgur.com/w1Ux6yY.png](https://i.imgur.com/w1Ux6yY.png)

>**Nathan is a friend to ambassadors, scholars, home cooks, celebrity chefs and writers. She has written regular columns for The Washington Post and the New York Times. She’s spoken to almost every important figure in 20th-century gastronomy and beyond, whether food writer M.F.K. Fisher or French chef Jean-Louis Palladin or Yotam Ottolenghi, the Israeli-born British chef. She’s close friends with Alice Waters, the chef and matriarch of the locavore movement.** She remembers names and details of interactions as if they occurred yesterday, even when they occurred more than 60 years ago, when she was a sixth-grader in Larchmont, N.Y.

The scientists mostly thought they were making the world a better place through science. The sponsors had other ideas. 

The scientist who presented a paper of the causes of leukemia in mice probably never expected his research would be used to induce leukemia in humans.

is a male-to-female transgender who served in the US military. She is a member of the [Pritzker family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family), heirs to the [Hyatt Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt). They use their estimated $29 billion dollar fortune to speculate on the stock market, dodge taxes, buy politicians, and rip people off with predatory banking schemes.

_____________

**Brief Pritzker Family Background** 

Over a dozen years ago, Gus Russo, an investigative journalist nominated for a 1998 Pulitzer Prize and former lead reporter for the award-winning PBS Frontline series, published a pair of massive volumes on the history of organized crime; ""The Outfit"" in 2001 discussing Chicago and ""Supermob"" in 2006 dealing with California. By the 1990s declassification of a vast quantity of government documents, including FBI wiretaps and Congressional files, allowed Russo access to this previously unavailable material. An early introductory summery in ""Supermob"" is reproduced below:

>Two types of power dominated the twentieth century: the visible, embodied in politicians, corporate moguls, crime bosses, and law enforcement; and the invisible, concentrated in the hands of a few power brokers generally of Eastern European and Jewish immigrant heritage. Operating safely in the shadows, these men often pulled the strings of the visible power brokers. Although they remained nameless to the public, they were notorious among a smattering of enterprising investigators who, over decades, followed their brilliant, amoral, and frequently criminal careers. The late Senate investigator and author Walter Sheridan dubbed them the Supermob.

Many dozens of the pages of Russo’s book document the underworld associations of several generations of Pritzkers, which began not long after the [founding father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nicholas_Pritzker) opened his Chicago law firm in 1902. The enormously diversified current assets of the Pritzker family are listed in Russo’s Appendix B, which occupies nearly six full pages, and the Pritzkers today remain one of the wealthiest families in the USA, with total assets of nearly $30 billion, and an enormous record of involvement in recent politics.

_____________

**The Pritzker Family Today**

The Pritzkers are heavily invested in the world of pharmaceuticals and science. Through the [Tawani Foundation](http://www.tawanifoundation.org/), [Jennifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Pritzker) has been able to corrupt and influence the direction of the ACLU, various military academies, medical institutions (including for children) and universities.

Other members of the Pritzker family donated $25 million to University of California at San Francisco’s child health department, which under the auspices of two Jews, predictably advocates for confused or ill young children to be given irreversible transsexual surgeries.

This money guarantees, in the very best case scenario, a veto on science that questions the validity of transgenderism, but often times just incentivizes these universities to produce pseudo-science in favor of it. UMN has a whole clinic dedicated to advocating in favor of and entertaining transgender insanity, targeting kids in particular

The ridiculous “controversy” over whether the military should allow transgenders is another product of Pritzker money. It is hard to believe that retired and current military men think it is important to include transsexuals in the armed forces, but 10s of millions of dollars can get many of these careerists “woke.”

[Jennifer Pritzker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Jennifer_Pritzker.jpg) is a life-long GOP donor, but the billionaire last year decried its “marginalization” at the hands of the Trump administration’s “rhetoric.” In its op-ed, Pritzker demands the GOP go back to focusing on low taxes for billionaires and defer to “experts” on issues like transgenderism – presumably the “experts” [Jennifer](https://illinoisfamilyaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JenniferPritzker-1.png) personally funds to say what it thinks.

The Pritzker family is intimately involved with the Democratic establishment, especially in their home city of Chicago where they enjoy close ties to the Israeli [Rahm Emanuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel) and Barack Obama.This family was very influential in Washington during the Obama years, where the Pritzkers, through bundling and personal donations, were able to collect $800 million dollars for Obama’s campaigns and inaugural funds.

Obama’s administration was important in using federal power to impose transgenderism in the public space, with pushes to integrate transsexuals into the military, creating “gender neutral” bathrooms in public schools and facilities, and increasing state funding to groups like the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds pro-transsexual activist groups. [Penny Pritzker’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker) close relationship to Obama led to the government looking away as her and her family cheated the estate’s tax system, paying $9 million on their inheritances rather than the $150 million they should’ve owed.

Obama in 2013 appointed his handler Penny Pritzker, who ran his campaign’s finance wing in ’08 and chaired his campaign in ’12, to oversee his Department of Commerce, which allowed her to set the terms and priorities on new government initiatives like NIMBL, a program that allocates R&D grants for research on biopharmaceuticals.

Like Jennifer, Penny’s private “philanthropy” is obsessed with influencing what children are taught as well as the university system. Her Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation has funneled millions into Harvard’s Medical School, which has purchased her a spot as a member of the Harvard Corporation. Harvard is known for institutionalizing an extreme form of gender ideology that it submerges future elites in.

Penny’s brother, fellow billionaire and [Governor J.B. Pritzker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker), has turned the state Illinois into a free for all, often with a tranny bent. He has signed executive orders and bills on immigration that ban local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE to deport criminal aliens, give wide swaths of Illinois’ illegal immigrant population amnesty, and developed a special incentive program for illegal and transgender students to receive public grants from the Monetary Award Program.

Governor Pritzker has also signed an executive order giving transgender and “non-binary” students special privileges in school, along with free access to an arsenal of lawyers that effectively controls the direction of sexual education and erases the First Amendment rights of fellow students.

The Pritzkers are only one, relatively small branch of America’s hereditary plutocracy. If you’re wondering why Presidential candidates like **Elizabeth Warren** or Great Wall Street Hope **Pete Buttigieg** have made the absurdity of transgenderism front and center in their campaigns, it’s because the Pritzkers are paying them to.

142,"Why are 99.9% of Christian churches worthless social clubs, that do nothing to stand up against evil? B/c they are neutered by the government through the 501c3 IRS designation, and all ""mainstream"" denominations are controlled from the top down via Freemasons and other Satanic influence",20.0,cinamn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cinamn/why_are_999_of_christian_churches_worthless/,17.0,1564263341.0,"Why do the ""mainstream"" churches not speak out and warn against against the ""New World Order"" conspiracy?  Shouldn't they be screaming from the rooftops at the top of their lungs about how the NWO agenda is the modern-day manifestation of the Satanic conspiracy for a one-world government, as foretold in the books of Daniel and Revelation?  Yet there is virtual silence.  There is NOTHING from these pathetic churches about this issue.

Why aren't there sermons every morning condemning abortion, Hollywood perversion, or the homosexual and transgender agendas that are destroying western society?   The level of wickedness taking over society right now is OFF THE CHARTS.  Yet the churches are silent.  

All you get from the mainstream churches is a ""love everything and everyone"" message.  And this mantra of the false teaching of ""saved by faith alone"" -- where all you have to do is ""believe only"", and you don't have to obey God's commandments or fight evil.  And the false teaching of the ""rapture"", where you don't have to care that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, because the ""world is going to end any day now"", as these false preachers have been saying for the last 100 years.

99.9% of mainstream churches are 501c3 organizations under the IRS.  Under these IRS rules, they will lose their tax-exempt status if they talk about ""political"" issues -- which is vagely defined and enforced, but I heard one preacher say that they can't discuss the government or ""political"" topics above 5% of the time in their sermons.  This is why you don't hear preachers speak out against particular politicians, political parties, or even touch ""political"" subjects such as homosexual ""marriage"" or abortion.

Also, mainstream denominations are controlled from the top-down, via hierarchical orginzations which are corrupt at the very top.  Obviously, the Catholic Church is totally corrupt, because the Vatican and Jesuit Order are Satanic organizations and control the entire organization from the top down.  Most Protestant churches are heavily infiltrated and controlled in the leadership positions by Freemasons.  Furthermore, the seminaries which produce the pastors have been heavily infiltrated, funded, and controlled by Satanic forces -- including the Rockefeller funding of many major Protestant seminaries.  

Above all, you can easily see how corrupt the churches are due to the fact virtually all denominations are subservient to and aligned with JUDAISM.  And, by the way, Judaism is Satanism.  Almost all churches support Zionism, and the lie that the ""jews"" are the true Israelites.  They will not allow ANY criticism of jews, and certainly will not speak out about the fact that elite jews rule Western society, and are subverting and destroying Christian morality and society.  This proves that the churches have been effectively taken over by Judaism, and the jewish NWO elites who rule our society.

It also came out several years back that many churches/pastors are partnered with the government via ""Clergy Response Teams"" -- where in the event of a ""crisis"", these pastors will work with government officials to direct their congregations to do certain things, such as turn in their guns and accept martial law, etc.",conspiracy,Transgender

So the Elite went in, set up some NGOs in countries they hate and have these NGOs divide the people in the name of ""Democracy"", then kill the ruling person and establish a dictator that will give all the country's resources to the elite.

Everyone knows that people are trying to run away from war torn places like Syria into more established countries like America to get a good life. The Elite used this goodwill to import masses of muslim mercenaries to kill locals and disguise it to evade the public attention.

Everyone wants to help out the disabled. Therefore, the elite told us to worship Homosexuals, Bisexuals and Transgender people as if they were gods, and those who do not abide to this are thrown to jail. Using this they also promote other deviant behaviour and weaken the societies from the inside.

Everyone hates their race being insulted; It's the worst way to be insulted by a person. Therefore the elite uses ethnic groups like black lives matter and mexican gangs to do their bidding of destroying entire societies from the inside, and deflects those who opposes those groups as rascist.

Everyone wants to help out ""Cancer Patients"" (Cancer is actually a production of the elite). Therefore, the Elite set up ""Pink Ribbon Movements"" and other fraud charities that do nothing to help research cancer and promote teraphies that instead KILL and FLEECE those patients, all the while when all legit herbal cures of cancer are considered illegitimate. 

Everyone wants to break free of the current matrix. Therefore, the elite made up stooges like Donald Trump, that claim to be on the good side and are believed by many of the good side, but in fact follow the same pro-war policies that their predecessors practice, and failed to practice what they preach. 

An alternate method to do this is to promote a nobody like Emmanuel Macron or Barack Obama into the point of gods and expect the public to believe they are saviours. The stooge then proceeds to destroy the country whatever way they want. Everyone wants change and it's better when the guy is a nobody since nobody knows what he will do and they think that they will have any positive change at all.

In text below ""Black Friday psy-op"" doesn't refer to Black Fridays as marketing operation but rather to what the illuminati have been staging with increased intensity in this decade on each Black Friday, **to make the sheep believe that their world is still the same**.
The break up of these psy-ops is used to illustrate:  
- psy-ops repeatedly served during a particular period of time: Black Friday psy-op, served each Black Friday with increased intensity each Black Friday, starting 2009 (in illuminati overtime)
- dependencies between scripts: for instance in which sequence the three scripts were written. The repeated script was obviously the first one but the text explains how London blackout was written before CNN porn leak.  
- basic concepts of illuminati scripts: parallel scripts, illuminati jokes, truth in plain sight (subliminally or not).

**London blackout Friday and Black Friday psy-ops: NOT parallel scripts**  
The main agenda of both scripts is the same, to divert the human cattle from the REALITY of Black Friday 2016, but that doesn't yet make them parallel scripts.  
The same goes for both being carried out the same day: it's rather a requirement posed by the shared agenda.  
Note that the same goes for the Black Friday psy-op and the Black Friday marketing operation: the first has to be carried out the same day as the second one (in this case no shared agendas).

**London blackout Friday: also an illuminati joke**  
The joke starts as obvious as it gets, using parallelism in plain sight to the Black Friday marketing operation: blackout starts with black; staged the same day.  
What is subliminally mocked: the coming blackout of any non-whites, starting with muslims and blacks.

**CNN falsely admits porn leak: psy-op and illuminati joke**  
The psy-op's main agenda is to support another ongoing psy-op advancing the agenda of formally abolishing the first amendment, the ""fake news"" psy-op.  
The joke starts as obvious as it gets, not only for the general audience (hardcore porn).  
First subliminal jokes: ""news"" channels' otherwise broadcast only fake news (""*more shocking than hardcore porn*"").  
The second subliminal joke, which is also part of any ""leak"" news: in reality there's no such thing as real-time broadcasting (one of the basic facts about illuminati media).  
This is enforced with parallelism to the London blackout Friday, suggesting that there was a blackout in the control mechanisms that ensures total control of any broadcast.  
There's a second subliminal layer to this enforced parallelism: the coming blackout of any real dissent in the internet (still found in YouTube and Twitter but censored from the beginning in Facebook).

Or the site is being investigated by feds or military. From the photos, we are presuming the man in the shirt bought a woman's shirt or they did not know it was a woman's shirt. Or did they do it on purpose? Or was it a counterfeit? The weird thing about the whole shirt scenario is the shirt shows a yellow hat and and white hand, holding a **black backpack**. The bomber was wearing all yellow, holding a black backpack. This could be a very strange coincidence, or was it planned? Like a smack in the face?

And I asked* ‘***when is the good fairy gonna take me along and change my body parts’*** *...that was a* ***turning moment*** *when they [my parents] realized I was different and had to help me become the girl I knew I was inside.”* 

At **3 years old** she was **diagnosed with gender dysphoria**. 

>*""When I was 2 years old, I went up to my mom and asked her, 'When is the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change my penis into a vagina?'"" Jazz Jennings, 18, told ABC News' ""Nightline"" co-anchor Juju Chang.*

On her show, “I am Jazz” there is clear *sexualizing of a minor* whether directly (asking her thoughts on an orgasm as a trans girl) or indirectly. They love to dance around the fact that she “has a penis” and talk about her sexuality often. 

Just for starters.

Now that said, there’s more to consider about Jazz: look up the anatomical differences between males and females. Now take a close look at Jazz. ***She has all the markers of a biological female***: feminine skull—no prominent brow ridge, no sloping back forehead, rounded jawline, small chin, no Adam’s apple, soft features, feminine wrists, clearly feminine digit ratio (pointer longer than ring) even how she puts on weight and it looks like hips about as wide as shoulders. And in this [**photo**](http://celebliveupdate.com/jazz-jennings-surgery-transgender-teen-dating-boyfriend/), female proportion arms and shoulders (last picture: *man* on the left, ***woman on the right***)

Many people are quick to label it as “paranoia” or even prejudice (assuming the intent is to slander rather than point out things which concern the public’s interest). But influential people in the spotlight, especially ones who are idolized by children, are very different than people in the general public (because of their influence) and should be held to a different standard.  I believe we have an *obligation* to question the people/messages which are shifting our perspectives and reshaping our society as a whole.

**TLDR; Jazz Jennings’ story doesn’t add up.....her show “I am Jazz” has significant sexual discussion/focus (i.e. orgasm talk) despite her being a *minor*......and she appears to have natural female anatomy (skeleton), indicating she may not be transgender. These things should at least be considered since she is praised as a role model for kids with gender dysphoria.**",conspiracy,Transgender

No we can’t! At our universities, which are meant to be bastions of free thought, guest speakers are barred for fear they might so much as question Left-wing dogma. This happens to even such distinguished liberals as Germaine Greer and Peter Tatchell.
The forces of political correctness impose their unyielding views everywhere.
At Oxford and Cambridge, there are calls for statues of historic benefactors to be torn down because they do not comply with fashionable modern positions on minority rights. At Newcastle University, meanwhile, the students’ union demanded sanitary bins in men’s loos so as not to upset any students ‘with a range of genders’.
Supposedly apolitical charities try to thrust correctness down the gullets of their staff. The National Trust instructs country house guides to wear gay pride badges. The RNLI sacks long-serving lifeboatmen for using tea mugs with risque images of women.

Theatre companies are left in no doubt that they will not be given Arts Council subsidies unless they cast a number of ‘non-traditional’ actors — i.e., women playing Shakespearean kings or Afro-Caribbeans as English Regency fops.
Firms ban employees wearing crosses in case they offend non-Christians or atheists (but it’s fine to wear a burka).
Elsewhere, a popular fun run is told it should no longer ask runners to declare if they are men or women (campaigners insist that ‘non-binary’ athletes might take mortal offence).
The Armed Forces are pressured to spend precious funds on almost totally unnecessary gender-neutral lavatories.
Cake decorators are told they must accept commissions from gay couples, and that fool the Mayor of London removes the male and female symbols from pedestrian signals in order to conform with the latest hare-brained theories about gender.

We live in an age of the minority mob. An odd expression, I know. Mob rule used to be an assertion of power through violence by the great unwashed, be it in the French Revolution or America’s racist deep south, when it lynched individuals.
It has been replaced by the no less illogical (and hardly less chilling) hysteria of a knot of activists who weaponise minority rights — they seem particularly obsessed with lavatories — and wield them as a political threat against the majority. More often than not, these agitators themselves are not part of the minorities that have allegedly been offended. They belong instead to a class of professional busybodies who seize on the minorities game for their own ends.
‘Diversity’ is now a booming employment sector and it offers hefty salaries. More insidiously, others exploit it for political ends and furtherance of their own ambitions.

The Twittersphere is full of these self-appointed stewards of indignation who see it as their job to police the media and shout down anyone who dissents from received opinion.
Their strategy is to expunge divergence of views and crush resistance to their creed of racial and sexual egalitarianism. Freedom of expression is something only they can enjoy.

They called her a neo-colonialist, a relic of ‘status quo bias’ and a supporter of ‘ingrained, insidious racism’. In short she was convicted of being a very nasty person (#human garbage, as they say online).

A gang of new writers from Penguin was organised into signing a denunciation of her and she was sacked from a literary awards judging panel run by a feminist magazine. Its editor was honest enough to admit that she was not distancing herself from Ms Shriver on account of her actual article. She was sacking her on account of the kerfuffle the article had caused.
The BBC and Left-wing media outlets such as the Guardian promptly piled into the melee, gleefully reporting these barbs against Ms Shriver. Someone was criticising quotas for minorities? Outrageous! Let’s authenticate her critics — and whip up further rage —by organising a phone-in or holding a studio debate on Radio 4’s Today programme!

It is worth looking at Ms Shriver’s article to see what she actually wrote. She began by noting that Penguin Random House had come up with a ‘company-wide goal’ that its authors must ‘reflect UK society by 2025’. Penguin announced: ‘We want our authors and new colleagues to reflect the UK population taking into account ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social mobility and disability.’
Such things would be more important, it said, than the matter of whether or not a prospective employee had been to university.
Ms Shriver proceeded to cite a questionnaire sent to Penguin authors about gender, sexuality and ethnicity. What had this to do with their writing ability? She concluded that Penguin was ‘drunk on virtue’ and no longer regarded its raison d’etre the ‘acquisition and dissemination of good books’.
‘Rather, the organisation aims to mirror the percentages of minorities in the UK population with statistical precision. Thus, literary excellence will be secondary to ticking all those ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual preference boxes.

‘We can safely infer from that email that if an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay transgender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers round town on a mobility scooter, it will be published, whether or not said manuscipt is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.’

In any sane country, Lionel Shriver’s article would be acclaimed as common sense. She was putting a meritocratic case — ie, people should be judged on their ability and talents. And who can really argue with meritocracy?
When we board an aeroplane, do we worry what sexuality or ethnicity the pilot has? No. We merely hope she or he knows how to operate the controls.
When we visit a dental practice, do we demand the medical professionals reflect the UK population’s minority profiles? I am more interested in their ability to drill and fill.
For the egalitarian commissars, higher considerations apply. For them, talent and ability come second to quotas of race, gender and sexual inclination.
This is because they want to broadcast that they are morally superior beings who support minorities. The politicians among them hope that, by appealing to those who identify themselves as minorities, they will win votes. This is called identity politics, but really it is the politics of the lunatic asylum.
There is a profoundly worrying problem with this tyranny of the minorities. By insisting every minority has preferential rights, you end up denying the majority their rights.
Imagine that you are applying for a job. You have all the qualifications and the necessary experience. But, as per that memorandum from Penguin Random House, you do not help the company ‘to reflect the UK population’.

Apologies, say your prospective employers, we can’t give you the job as another candidate has a disability/sexual preference/skin colour we haven’t yet ticked off our staff lists. We’d have loved to hire you, we really would, but our diversity policy means we need a one-legged Latino goat-fancier.
Diversity is supposed to stop discrimination. But what is this if it is not discrimination? Diversity is supposed to provide greater opportunities for people no matter their colour, creed, sexuality, gender, ethnicity or inside leg measurement. A reasonable onlooker will say ‘but we should encourage minorities’. Of course we should. But Penguin’s appalling policy will achieve the very opposite, for it will force the company to recruit a mirror image of the population.
The entirely noble idea of diversity thus becomes an inflexible rod. It becomes a menace. This will not make the majority feel more kindly towards minorities. It will ignite resentment. And how exactly does it comply with equality laws which forbid treating people differently according to ethnicity, race, sexuality or disability?

A few months ago, I had an experience like Ms Shriver’s when I criticised the Royal Shakespeare Company for what I felt was some clumsy, minority-quotas casting in a Restoration comedy. I asked if the RSC was being leaned on by the Arts Council (which places inordinate store by its diversity policies). Did it fear that unless it cast black actors in historically white roles it might not be given such big dollops of public cash?
Like Lionel Shriver, I did not suggest that minorities were creatively less gifted than anyone else. Not in the slightest. I merely questioned the wisdom and morality of putting political correctness before raw merit. For this, I was swiftly and repeatedly maligned and misrepresented. Whoomph!

The RSC denounced me as a racist and numerous blowhards in the subsidised theatre world pretty much compared me to Satan. Behind the scenes, senior theatre practitioners told me they completely agreed with me — but feared that if they said so in public, their careers would be damaged.

In medieval Spain, the Inquisition caused terror by chasing down anyone who uttered public heresy (i.e. questioned Roman Catholic dogma). The Inquisition itself was small, but it was brutally effective at snuffing out dissent. With fire and torture, it came down hard on a few prominent free-thinkers and that was enough to create widespread repression.
Spain’s population saw the way so-called heretics had been pulled limb-from-limb and it thought ‘crumbs, we’d better do what we are told’.
In medieval days torture was physical — men were boiled, put on the rack, or subjected to the Pear of Anguish, the Judas Cradle or the Saw, brutal instruments which concentrated pain on the most sensitive areas of the anatomy.
In more recent times, political regimes such as Mao’s China and Hendrik Verwoerd’s South Africa have suppressed dissent. I remember, as a child holidaying in Sixties Spain, being told never to utter out loud the name of the country’s fascist dictator, General Franco. ‘It’s just safer not to say it,’ said my mother.
Maybe someone should have given similar advice to Lionel Shriver. Maybe someone should have said: ‘Don’t mock diversity — it’ll only land you in the most frightful trouble’.

Under this tyranny of the minorities, that may be what you should do for an easy life. But the thing about tyrannies is that they are ruled, ultimately, by bullies. The way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them, as Lionel Shriver has done with such brave clarity.
British public life is not like Dr Strangelove’s war room. It is a place where the lively conflict of views should be welcomed as an essential part of a flourishing democracy. Freedom of expression has been fought for with blood over the centuries and is vital for liberal, civilised behaviour. No minority mob should ever be allowed to destroy that.",conspiracy,Transgender

162,"Anything you read on this website or anything else on the internet is ""State approved propaganda"" (How the state controls the opposition, and the minds of the civilians)",16.0,f8htgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f8htgp/anything_you_read_on_this_website_or_anything/,19.0,1582500002.0,"This applies to this sub, 4chan, and any other place where alleged ""resistance"" might exist. The state understands that while these groups aren't a real threat, there is a tiny potential for a threat to the government. This means that these places are constantly monitored, all of them having government agents and propagandists working for ""advocacy groups"" moderating them, removing any argument that isn't kosher as seen by the government.

Why is 4chan racist if it is only state approved propaganda? This is because thes state approves racism and other sorts of extremist ideologies on sites like that to cater to the people who are exiled from society. The government here uses 4chan as the Emmanuel Goldstein for the West. 4chan constantly makes endless empty threats against the most ""vulnerable"" people in the world, and then the government and media use this illusion of ""danger"" to justify furthering their stranglehold upon the country, increasing protection for these people, and stripping people of their rights to argue with the government's vision of ""progress"".

Just like in that old meaningless and forgotten Texas shooting, where the Federal Agents literally convinced a dude to shoot up some place and even gave him guns to do this, the government can sleep a lot better at night when their ""enemies"" do exactly what the government wants them to do. When the government controls their enemies, this means they have no threats.

Any individual who seeks to oppose the government finds themselves forced into bed with these forces of controlled opposition like 4chan, White Nationalism, etc, and since the government controls the propaganda hubs for these places, then the government now effectively controls whatever enemies they might have.

The discontented have no place to turn to voice their opinions besides these places, and this allows the government to then aggressively indoctrinate them with state-approved opposition arguments. These arguments blend into the mainstream narrative of ""domestic terror"" which the government is currently using to strip people of their rights including free speech and the right to bear arms. Most, if not all of these attacks are likely either fabricated entirely or directly induced by the government, and so long as there is an ""apparently legitimate group"" that can then be ""held accountable"" for these actions, then people will believe that the government black flag attacks are legitimate.

This means, so long as 4chan exists, then attacks citing racism are ""seemingly realistic"" because there is a vocal and racist minority on the internet. If the mass shootings were all in the name of ""removing labor laws"", then this would seem suspicious, because there aren't a substantial number of young discontented people who are vocally furious about the existence of labor laws.

The issue here is again that ""White Nationalist"" types are not actually threatening people at all. They are the same kids who would call you racist names on the internet when they were 12, and just like how that guy didn't come and ""Fuck your mom"" after threatening to do this online, he isn't going to commit any acts of terrorism either.

This puts the government in a pickle, because these terror attacks are the most powerful tool in the government's arsenal with respect to shepherding the people, or otherwise pushing them away from a certain ideology and pushing them towards what the government wants. This is anti-Nationalist pro-gun-control today, but 20 years ago it was Pro-War in the Middle East and opposed to pacifisim/isolationsim.

There are two types of terror attacks, the amateurs and the professionals. There is a profound difference in damage done by these people. Think of the meme video about the kid trying to shoot water bottles with a shotgun from 5 feet away. This guy turned out to be a mass shooter that nobody cared about because he didn't cause serious damage.

Then there are the ""big names”,  who are clearly trained in how to use a gun and do this very well. These people make very calculated attacks and execute them with precision. These people are the ""black flags"", possibly produced by governmental and super-governmental powers, meant to provide legitimacy to a movement that would otherwise be full of nothing but emaciated, disorganized, meek, scared, passive, non-physically aggressive, and largely powerless man-children. I say this solely because of the drastic and profound difference between the ""organic"" White Nationalists you see on the streets, and those who execute large-scale terror attacks in the manner of trained soldiers.

However, the true value of controlling social media is not controlling the opposition. It is controlling you, the civilian.

There is another comparably valuable use of sites like 4chan and reddit, and that is just for the dissemination of propaganda. By controlling these websites, you are essentially controlling the conversations people have, what information they have access to, who they speak to, and effectively how they speak, think, analyze, understand, and reason with the world.

This is a very powerful tool because the government has invested a significant degree of resources into manipulating the speech and conversation patterns on these websites to ensure that people do as little thinking as possible. People read only 1-2 sentences, every time, and this conditions them to speak in only 1-2 sentence comments, often times nothing more than an empty quip or one liner.

This thought and speech pattern is incredibly powerful. 1-2 sentences is never enough to produce a substantial argument, as an 1-2 sentence argument can be dismissed outright due to a lack of support. When people are conditioned to use this speech pattern, then they are conditioned to never make a sound argument in their life, and this means the government is now functionally unassailable by the general public, simply because their minds cannot and will never process a cohesive argument.

There are numerous advantages to ensuring your civilians have this speech pattern. The internet mandates that short 1-2 line reactionary opinions and 1 line jokes are the standard form of communication. This means that even when these people leave the internet, they will rely back upon this familiar form of conversation. Throughout their daily life, their thoughts will be limited to 1-2 lines of purely reactionary opinion based sentiments.

This makes it very easy to control what people think and do, because when you control the images, news, words, and statements that these people see, then you can effectively control their mind, provided that the natural and commonplace reaction to these things is predictable enough.

The peasants are trained only to react in 1-2 sentence remarks, and let this rest as their full understanding of the situation at hand. This means if you can predict the 1-2 sentences that will run through their mind, then you can strategically show them certain news videos, pictures, and other media just to produce the intended and desired thoughts.

It's much easier to predict a 1-2 sentence opinionated reaction than it is to predict a long-winded, objective, and evidence based argument. This is why conditioning people to be averse to reading and making legitimate arguments is so valuable.

When you can predict how people will react accurately, then you can reliably attain the desired outcome in the person's mind. The government is very good at this by now, and they know that having a reliably shallow, reactionary, terse, and opinionated reaction to things is a much more easily manipulated psychological state for a human when compared to a long, thoroughough, objective, and analytical thought process.

Even on bastions of ""the resistance"" this method is still the standard fare of communication. Any sort of 1-2 line reactionary opinionated statement that produces no valid argument is the most blatant form of indoctrination that is visible in the general public. Statements like these do nothing beyond make baseless claims such as support/approval/indifference/denial/condemnation/joke and the condemnation never anything more than name-calling, without the condemner providing any objective argument.

When a human mind is conditioned to produce only these 6 outputs, this creates a profound simplification of the human mind which is much more easily managed by the powers that be. Rather than be faced with a truly intelligent person with the capacity to analyze any point and provide a sound evidence-based and logic-based counter-argument, the state has positioned themselves by indoctrinating and conditioning the general public so the state only needs to deal with 6 possible outcomes that result from their actions.

Making a statement that is predictably ""supported"" or ""approved"" becomes much easier than making a statement that withstands valid, objective, logic-based, and evidence-based argument. Since the people are conditioned via online communication to avoid any thinking that extends beyond these 6 basic outcomes, this makes things like politics and media much more easily managed due to the simplification of what would be incredible natural volatility in situations if people were conditioned to wield the full analytical capacity of their mind.

When the human mind is limited to these 6 outputs, then it becomes incredibly easy to push a narrative and force progress upon society, because so long as the government or media can create messages that are reliably approved/supported, then they don't need to produce any logical or evidence-based legitimization of their claims. The measurement of validity ends at the support of the people. If the people support an idea, then that idea is valid, because the people have no concept of evidence-based or logic-based methods of legitimizing an idea.

Still, the benefits to this communication style go on. This style is one that can easily be mastered by children. It is ideal for the lazy, it is ideal for those who would rather not read or write. This style effectively rewards those who are lazy, because it allows them to dominate social discourse. When people can get popularity for minimal work, this makes them happy, and this is beneficial to the government when this minimal work involves condemning legitimate arguments on account of the word count.

When actual arguments get condemned simply for being different than one of the 6 baseline outputs, then this means that there will never be counterarguments to whatever statements the government wants to issue. These arguments get condemned because the lazy peasants hate reading and writing, and this makes them ostracize people who expect them to do this.

The condemnation issued by the lazy is then further reinforced by the government and their propagandists as needed. These people emulate the style of the lazy, and in turn further reinforce this logic with aggressive rhetoric against anyone who strays from the 6 outputs. With 50% of America reading at or below the level of a 5th grader, and propagandists providing very aggressive support for this majority and condemnation of all who speak in a manner beyond 1-2 sentence basic outputs, this then sets the standard for communication on the internet, but more importantly acceptance within any social community online.

With these people as the majority, this forces all others to amalgamate and adopt their communication style, just in order to be acknowledged and respected. If you speak in 1-2 sentences and restrict yourself to the 6 basic outputs, then you will be respected by these people, and if you agree with them, they will gladly let you circle-jerk egos with them. Still, if you stray from 1-2 sentence basic outputs, you will be condemned, ignored, and eventually censored if the state dislikes what you say enough.

The lazy majority holds a very powerful position, because they are the sole providers of social acceptance on the internet, and this is a very powerful temptation to most people. This is because the human mind is far more instinctively designed to seek social acceptance than it is to seek the obscure and intangible concept of the truth.

Humans will readily believe lies and perpetuate lies if this means gaining acceptance and support from their fellow man, and it is this instinctive desire to be socially accepted that the government abuses to ensure that all people adopt this thought-style of 1-2 sentence basic outputs.

This instinctive desire for social acceptance is incredibly influential on the internet, because the people who use the internet are traditionally social outcasts with little to no social connections in the world. These are the people most desperate for social approval, and these are the people most willing to abandon any principles or logic they may pertain to simply to attain the social support of other humans.

There are other means of influencing the human mind when the state has a stranglehold on social media platforms. One of these is through desensitization. By consistently forcing people to see things, this causes people to become desensitized to these things. If you show a devout christian man a video of two men having sex, he will be disgusted. If you show him this video 5 times a day for a year, the video will eventually produce very little if any response in the man.

This is a powerful tool when the state seeks to push something that is seen as radical, controversial, or otherwise something that has been historically unpopular among the general public. This can be seen with every action of social progress in our country over the past 200 years, as the media will constantly be rife with the ""new flavor of tolerance"", pushing this relentlessly, as a means to desensitize people to these issues. Common occurences today include the meme ""Netflix has only gay characters"".

Even if things like immigration, atheism, homosexuality, feminism, socialism, transgenderism, racial integration, or other contentious issues that upset people which are championed by the media, after you force them to see these things 100s of times a week, eventually the human mind loses the ability to care. Their mind comes to terms with the fact that their indignation is futile, and eventually they stop resisting these things.

The second stage to desensitization is normalization, and eventually acceptance. People begin to see these things as normal, then they begin to accept these things. These people begin to accept the things that they once believed unforgivable, often times resorting to these things themselves.

Think of yourself as a child (1980-90s, DARE-era), and how much you hated drugs and cigarettes due to propaganda. Then, after seeing your friends do drugs and smoke cigarettes, after the initial shock, you slowly stopped caring, and eventually had a cigarette or a puff on the joint. If you are older than this, there was still reliably state propaganda that conditioned you to hate or fear something, but eventually, after seeing this entity (racial minorities, communism, homosexuals, etc.) so many times, you became desensitized and indifferent to it.

Another more political example would be the War in the Middle East, as 20 years ago, people would consistently protest these things, but for the past 10 years, nobody really cared.

The human mind doesn't have the capacity to continue caring for prolonged periods of time. If the human mind realizes that their caring doesn't change anything about the facts of the matter, eventually they stop caring at all. I myself am a great example of this, as once I wrote aggressively attempting to hold arguments with people and uncover the truth, but now, as I have been brutally reminded that these efforts are futile as they are contrary to the whims of the state, I seldom write anymore.

While the progressives will think ""There is nothing wrong with being open minded and tolerating people"", the issue is that this method can be applied to anything and everything. Desensitization doesn't just provide normalization and acceptance for homosexuals, desensitization also provides normalization and acceptance for things like government corruption, and now, things like marijauna.

Even while marijuana may seem harmless, it can easily have a detrimental effect on the lives of people who use it, simply because all pleasurable or enjoyable things can easily abused, and marijuana is no different than alcohol, cigarettes, sex, gambling, computers, or any other seemingly appropriate habit people can become harmfully addicted to.

Again, the issue is not marijauna or government corruption, because these are facts of life which we know we cannot change. The issue is that even more dangerous and radical social and political ideologies can easily be force-fed to the general public this way, and due to desensitization, they will become normalized and accepted over the course of 5-10 years.

Whatever you think is ""unthinkable"" today, can easily be made ""the norm"" tomorrow, all through this tactic the government and media have proven themselves to be avid proponents of in order to produce their desired ends. The most dangerous of which today include the threat to civil rights, not limited to freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, because to infringe upon these rights is a sign of danger, because ""when you give a man an inch, he will take an ell"", and once the government has normalized removing your civil rights, and once you have come to accept this, it then becomes much easier for them to push the envelope even further.

One example being the slow tolerance of the passive and quiet gay community, which once fully fledged, rapidly allowed for the normalization and explosion of the aggressive rhetoric of transgender individuals, who are constantly upset, who demand a whole new can of rights, despite being a community of people that the country was almost entirely oblivious to just 10 years ago.

This is not to say anything is bad. It's just saying that once something has become normalized, this opens the door for further steps down the line to be normalized. The comparison between the gays and the transgender community being that gay people often look like straight people, you often can't tell that a person is gay unless they are very flamboyant, and this is why they were able to be in the closet and function as if they were not gay, simply because nobody knew. This is opposed to transgender people who often don't blend in as easily, even if they were not given so much media attention.

The point being that tolerating and accomodating the gays was a small, subtle change, whereas tolerating and accomodating transgender individuals is often a large and obvious change to many. However, due to the known social standard of acceptance and tolerance for gays, this also extends to transgender individuals, meaning that now that they have their foot in the door, they feel much more secure being vocal and aggressive advocates for themselves.


(As for Mass Shootings, These are often blatantly fabricated, as in the case of things like Sandy Hook, where the victim's father couldn't sue the writer for stating ""This even did not happen and was a staged false-flag attack produced by the government"", due to a lack of evidence, but he had legal right to sue the father for saying that ""he personally forged the death certificate"", because clearly the crisis actor did not forge the death certificate, which is a false statement independent from the legitimacy of the shooting.

Logically this means the writer was spot on in his allegations about the shooting, because they could not produce evidence in court to condemn him for anything beyond that false statement, which would all be libelous . That being said, when the state has the legal right to fabricate terror attacks, they can just as easily fabricate ""evidence"" and use this in a court trial.


From ""False Statement of Fact - Wikipedia""  --  ""The fifth category is one that is not as firmly set by precedent: false statements, even deliberate lies, against the government may be protected.[9] While some ""seditious libel"" may be able to be punished, political statements are likely protected.[10]""

Due to the fact that the Writer was making what can be seen as seditious libel, it is likely that the government could easily set the precedent in court for slander due to making false statements, were there any hard evidence to support this guilt, which is easy to fabricate.

The rule of thumb for mass shootings is habeas corpus. If they don't show you visible images of the bodies being dead beyond a reasonable doubt, then the shooting did not occur. There are no pictures of bodies from Sandy Hook.

CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE 

The seven days of creation are generations of gods


Abzu is Fresh Water
Tiamat (Also Nammu) is a Dragon Lizard Goddess, Salt Water. 
They had kids.
Lahmu
Lahamu 
These guys represent the zodiac and constellations.
They had kids.
Anshar, Whole Heaven. God.
Kishar, Whole Earth. Gaia.
They meet at the horizon (Fuck) and Anu and Ninhursag (Ki) are born.
Anu and Ki farther the Anunnaki, most importantly Enki and Enil.

List of Anunnaki:

An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna

These made the Igigu, slave race that preceded humans.

Enki and Ninhursag 


Kids:
Ninsar (Goddess of Greenery), Enki then, not knowing she is his daughter, fucks her.
Ninsar gives birth to Ninkurra (Goddess of Fruitfulness), Enki then fucks Ninkurra who gives birth to Uttu ( Weaver of The web of life), Uttu hides from Enki but he gets her drunk with Beer and rapes her. Ninhursag turns up and removes the semen from Uttu and plants it which grows into 8 plants that Enki later eats.
He becomes ill because of this and proceeds to be sick / ejaculate into Ninhursag’s mouth where she gives birth to gods of healing, Abu for the Jaw, Nintul for the Hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the Limbs. The last one, Ninti (Lady Rib), is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.

CREATION OF MAN

These guys pissed of Tiamat at some point and Abzu could not change her mind on the idea of killing the younger gods. Mummu is bought in to discuss the idea and ends up agreeing that the younger gods should be killed. Enki hears about this and casts a spell sending Abzu to sleep.
He then killed Abzu, took Abzu’s Halo and wore it whilst chaining up Mummu.
Enki then takes the place (Abzul’s palace in Iraq) as his own with Ninhursag as his queen. Marduk is then created in this domain who is more powerful than Enki. Anu create 4 winds?



 
At some point the offspring of Abzu killed him. The other gods of this tier said to Tiamat that she did nothing to stop this death. She hired a lizard general called Kingu and gave him Abzuls “The Tablet of Destinies” which resulted in Tiamat making dragons “filled with venom and not blood” to fight the lower class of gods, Enki and anu were scared of the monsters Tiamat had created! until Marduk Enkis son was summoned he feared no woman and killed the monsters and Tiamat. Her body is this reality. Marduk gives the sky to Anu, the land to Enki and the air between to Enil. The monsters were turned into statues.

Marduk then writes the likenesses of the gods in the skies making the constellations, the zodiac signs and defines the amount of days in a year. The clouds are made and this creates the Tigris and Euphrates (biggest rivers in Iraq).

Kingu is sacrificed and his blood is used to create man. Enki is initially against this although eventually comes around.

600 gods are assigned to the over world and 300 assigned to the underworld.

Marduk then commission Babylon and a temple and throne are built for him, Esagila.

Marduk, Enki and Enil live there.

Marduk goes on to replace Enil.

Man is created out of all the gods spit, the blood of Kingu and clay and after 10 months the specially made womb breaks open and humans are born. 

Overpopulation of humans leads to a famine being sent every 1200 years.
Enil is bad.
Enki is good.
Enil decides the whole thing is too much hassle and begins to plan the destruction of humanity whilst Enki is sworn to secrecy.

Genesis 6 States that man were given 120 years, that the men of gods had children with human women and they bore hero’s onto the world. The lord Enil was pissed at how un-compassionate humans had become and regretted their creation. It states that as female humans were beginning to increase in number the sons of god married any they chose.

Enki tells Utnapishtim / Atrahasis / Noah that Enil is going to flood the world and he must rip down his house and make a boat and fill it with animals and his family to preserve life. The flood comes. 7 days pass. The boat gets stuck on top of Pir Omar Gudrun and the Gods Enki, Enil, Inanna and Ninurta descend from Anu and Enil looses his shit at Enki, Enki reminds Enil of the need for compassion and  Utnapishtim / Atrahasis his made a god, granted immortality and moved to a house at the rivers mouth.

Utnapishtim / Atrahasis appears again in the Epic of Gilgamesh where he recounts the story to Gilgamesh who is on the path for immortality. He states to Gilgamesh that immortality was a gift for preserving life and that of Gilgamesh wanted to attempt the same feat he should try and conquer sleep. He fails at the first hurdle and falls asleep. As he is leaving Utnapishtim / Atrahasis’s his wife says that he should leave Gilgamesh with a parting gift. He is told of a plant at the bottom of the sea which will make him younger. He retrieved it and whilst he is bathing on the shore after coming out the ocean a snake steals it.

He returns back to his home town defeated but the walls of the city remind him that this is how humanity live forever.


Enki fucks up by having a drinking competition with his daughter È-Anna and whilst inebriated gives her the gifts of gods (Mes) that we’re collected by Enil and given to Enki to distribute out to the humans at different city centers. These included:

**SUPER MA'AM**

Super Ma'am, AKA saraTONIN (The rap legend) First appeared on the Internet radar on Dec 28, 2018 when a GameStop employee accidentally misgendered... Sara, we'll call them Sara.

This initial incident itself seems obvious enough, A nice transgender lady goes into a GameStop already in a poor mood because of some refund situation (we've all been there) and then to add insult to injury the lowly clerk mistakenly declares the word ""sir"".  While I can't fault the clerk for the mistaken identity or Sara for the frustration of an unsatisfactory customer service experience, I absolutely CAN fault the collision of Universe 1 with Universe 2.

At some point in the past, our universes collided gently as they drifted past one another in the Great Architect's Koi pond.  It doesn't matter which Universe you were originally in before the collision, you're now stuck here with me in the crossover bubble designated Universe 1-2.

The relative affect of being trapped in Universe 1-2 has been discussed lightly as ""The Mandela effect"" or in scientific circles as ""The Mandela Orifice"".  These affects include but are not limited to mind headaches, dizzyness, blurred vision, constipation and/or diarrhea, loss of appetite and most notably disorientation cause by phantom memories from your universe of origin.

The cultural divide we are experiencing is only now, years later, rearing its head as refugees from Universe 1 pair themselves away from refugees from Universe 2.  As we are attracted to kindred from our own universe of origin and repelled from ""those other people"" our new reality of Universe 1-2 is becoming dangerously segregated into two distinct yet impossible to articulate hives.

Sara and GameStop Employee illustrate this division very well because both of them are from different universes where each of them would be behaving appropriately were they still in their universe of origin.  For the record it was called GameSpot... not GameStop in my universe of origin and this is important because it is on the cusp of these strange and difficult to articulate rifts in reality that we are most likely to experience a breakdown in social cohesion.

For some odd reason, GameSpot/GameStop became one of the many flickering pixels in the afterbirth of Universe 1-2.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgiOjhkiuhw (Original Super Ma'am meltdown video)

Watching Sara and GameSpot employee struggle to grok each other's position in interesting because both of their instincts are appropriate in Universe 1 or Universe 2 individually but neither of their behaviors is appropriate in Universe 1-2.

Now it has come to my attention that agents from Universe 2 are organizing a campaign of reality domination that directly supports a losing thread from Universe 2 that they aren't willing to let go of.

They are trying to prop up Sara as an agent of change and they believe they can eventually eradicate all remaining evidence of Universe 1 from our crossover universe 1-2.

Here are some examples of their social media blitz 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvN2KD_b_V0 (A highly polished rap music video featuring Sara)


https://youtu.be/_9M2rSTy67U?t=55 (A staged ""rap battle"" between Sara and Michael White where they clearly hired the most annoying bad rapper they could find to set up an easy win for Sara)

Be careful out there folks and avoid places that seem to produce feelings of deja vu or that you remember to be different but can't articulate it clearly.

We may eventually ""snap back"" into our proper universes but there is no way for us to know as this is the first time in human record that two universes have collided in such a way.",conspiracy,Transgender

Does it matter at all, or is it a 'personal choice'?

We are being pressured on all sides to get vaccinated against corona. The media promote it, billboards and commercials praise it. Meanwhile, politicians, companies and educational institutions are threatening social isolation, dismissal, denial of access to lectures. Banks have even announced that they will not open business accounts for organizations that are making a counter-noise and are actively working against these organizations if they already have an account. If you refuse the jab, then there are also the invectives, the frames: if you do not participate in the vaccination program you are stupid, paranoid, a 'conspiracy theorist', an 'antivaxxer', a spreader of 'disinformation', selfish, not supportive, irresponsible. Step by step, those who do not want a jab and make a different assessment, who believe in their own immune system, in their own health, life is made more difficult. The pressure is increasing.

But those who have been vaccinated can still get corona and transmit it. In fact, according to recent data, those who have been vaccinated have a virtually equal chance of getting and spreading the Delta variant as unvaccinated ones. And while those who have had it are probably immune for life (and have much better immunity than a vaccine can ever give you), they also have to get a jab after six months! There is no logic. What is really going on here? Is it still enough to continue to see vaccination as a 'personal choice', or is it gradually becoming a moral obligation not to take the vaccine - because only in this way can this medical compulsion still be stopped?

1. THE VIRUS IS STILL NOT PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS 

First of all, the virus that this is all about is not and remains not particularly dangerous. The IFR (or: the mortality, the lethality) is well below 1 percent, which means that more than 99 percent of the people who get corona just get better again. Worldwide, the mortality rate fluctuates around 0.15 percent - slightly higher than the mortality rate of seasonal flu (due to the relatively ageing population, both numbers in the Netherlands are slightly higher than the global average - but also not extremely much higher). Compared to influenza, the number of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 is also somewhat higher, but we do not see a shocking contrast there either. In addition, we must take into account that the somewhat greater appeal to care, in addition to the specific course of corona, obviously also has to do with the psychosomatic effects of the enormous panic that has been with us for eighteen months. People are scared en masse and are more likely to knock on the door of the doctor than before. Meanwhile, the figures still show virtually no excess mortality and die from Corona almost only very vulnerable people with underlying serious diseases. If you look at the total number of deaths in 2020, you will also not see a large increase compared to previous years. In short, there is actually little to worry about.

[https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fvd/pages/2969/attachments/original/1629912573/grafiek.png?1629912573](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fvd/pages/2969/attachments/original/1629912573/grafiek.png?1629912573)

2. THE EFFECT OF THE VACCINES IS DUBIOUS 

Most corona vaccines are based on new gene manipulation techniques that have been widely used for the first time since 2020. Their effect is quite special: healthy body cells are stimulated by means of biological codes (so-called 'mRNA') to produce specific proteins and thus mimic certain effects of a virus infection - which in theory should improve the human immune system and develop a kind of quasi-immunity. Now, in principle, it is quite possible that the vaccines have some protective effect due to this complex manipulation of the immune system. But because serious consequences of Covid-19 are rare in both groups - vaccinated and unvaccinated - the efficacy of the vaccine is difficult to demonstrate with statistical significance. In addition, coronaviruses are mutating rapidly, which means that there are already a large number of new variants that are quite different from the original Wuhan variant on which the vaccines were designed. For example, the protective effect of the vaccines (if it already existed) has in any case been severely reduced and it has also become clear that permanent herd immunity will never be achieved by vaccination.

3. VACCINATED PEOPLE ARE JUST AS HIGH A 'RISK OF INFECTION' AS UNVACCINATED PEOPLE 

In addition, the corona variants seem to develop in the usual direction for viruses: more contagious, less dangerous. This means, among other things, that vaccinated people also appear to become relatively easily infected with the recent 'Delta' variant. They can then also infect others. In fact, if Big Pharma is right - and vaccinated people get fewer symptoms when infected than unvaccinated people - then they will be the main contagioners par excellence. After all, they are less likely to 'realize' that they are sick (and therefore contagious)... they go on with ordinary life and meet others, go to work, attend a party... and so the idea that unvaccinated people would specifically pose a danger to society also turns out to be a myth (moreover, vaccinated people no longer have to 'test for access' anywhere, so that the chance that they will continue with social interaction despite their infection is also greater than the chance that unvaccinated people do).

4. NO VACCINE WILL EVER MAKE CORONA DISAPPEAR

But more importantly, no vaccine is ever going to make influenza, corona, rhino or any other 'zoonotic' virus disappear permanently. These viruses are constantly mutating, have been with us for centuries - and are also carried along and transmitted by animals. Unlike diseases such as smallpox, which only go from person to person (and which can therefore be eradicated), these flu-like viruses will always remain among us. 'Zero infections' - the implicit goal of all these measures - is therefore completely unachievable and unrealistic. Where the flu shot (with all its ifs and buts) is provided annually to the elderly and weak who ask for it, now the corona injection (with again: experimental gene therapy, fundamentally different from any previous flu shot) is imposed on the entire population - including young people and children. Young people are hardly at risk in the event of a Covid infection . So they don't do it for themselves. But the argument that society can 'beat' Covid-19 through mass vaccination, and that young people therefore take the jab for a higher social purpose ('you do it for someone else'), also makes no sense. The vaccines do not provide sterile immunity (and that is not claimed by the producers at all). It is impossible to eradicate corona by vaccination.

5. VACCINATION IS CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT RISK 

Meanwhile, the side effects of the vaccines appear to be considerably more serious and numerous than those of classic vaccines. And then it's only about the short term: the long-term side effects are completely unknown. But in this short-term registration, the number of serious side effects and deaths from the vaccines is already order of magnitude higher than we've seen so far with any classic vaccine. We see the same picture abroad.

[https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fvd/pages/2969/attachments/original/1629912776/balk2.png?1629912776](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fvd/pages/2969/attachments/original/1629912776/balk2.png?1629912776)

6. SO JUST AS A PERSONAL CHOICE? 

So should we see vaccination against Covid-19 as a purely personal choice? One wants it, the other doesn't - and there's no arguing about taste? Who wants to make certain food choices, or who wants to smoke, drink, take hormones - we like to leave it to the individual to make their own decisions. Taking a vaccine that hardly works, has dangerous side effects and is directed against a disease with a mortality similarity to the flu should therefore in principle be free for everyone. If people necessarily want to pay 30 euros to Pfizer and take two injections of gene therapy - well, maybe they should be able to go about their business freely (but why these liquids have to be funded by the taxpayer completely escapes us). However!

7. YES, HOWEVER! 

Here's the problem: in this particular situation, there's something crazy going on. We've just had a year and a half of lockdowns, one and a half meters, face masks, 'testing for access' and so on. New variants are coming and therefore most likely new lockdowns are coming. We can see from everything that there is a vaccination urge - if not downright vaccination compulsion - is coming. And once those vaccines are put in place, citizens must carry a digital vaccination passport that allows the government to check everyone's medical status at any time. That also includes being able to see where someone has been, with whom he or she has had contact, and so on. Isn't it going to be a little different in such a situation? Does 'free choice' remain as 'free', if this means that:

(a) the unvaccinated are completely excluded from social life, and b) the vaccinated (via that 'app') also lose their freedom and privacy? 

In this particular case, has it not actually become a duty to refuse vaccination? Precisely to prevent this absurd dichotomy that threatens to arise from blocking this absurd control society? Indeed: is it still about public health? Or do we see here the contours of a totalitarian state looming through the bond of public health?

8. VACCINATION RETROACTIVELY LEGITIMIZES THE PREVIOUS LOCKDOWNS By taking a (barely working and experimental) ""vaccine"" (with also strong side effects and in the long term completely unknown risks) you implicitly confirm that we are dealing with a very dangerous virus (quod non) that we should be very afraid of (because why else would you run that risk, why would you take that jab); and so you retroactively give legitimacy to the lockdowns and other deprivation of liberty measures that - as was always said - would be ""necessary"" until the arrival of the ""vaccine"".

9. VACCINATION LEGITIMISES FUTURE LOCKDOWNS WITH PROGRESSIVE FORCE 

Secondly, you also legitimize the impending lockdowns when the (inevitable) ""new variants"" come again; which, of course, must also be followed by new ""vaccines"" (as NRC columnist Rosanne Hertzberger put it: ""Vaccinated patients are the first proof of rapidly fading immunity. So there will be third, and fourth, and each time new mutants, which require fifth and sixth and seventh. (...) You normally have to despair about that kind of 'slippery slope' argumentation, but in the corona crisis it has always turned out to be the reality."").  Have you now been injected once in this first round, with what argument do you say later, at the next half-yearly vaccination injections, that you will no longer participate? So you will never get out of this again, you enter a trajectory of perpetual cycles: outbreak of a new variant, lockdown, new vaccinations, new 'admission tickets', new outbreak, etc.

10. VACCINATION FACILITATES THE NEW NORMAL 

But most importantly, by participating in the vaccination program and accepting and using the 'vaccination certificate', you facilitate the 'new normal'. Through lockdowns and social distancing, we have moved to semi-mandatory vaccinations and a 'QR society' in which 'proof' of your medical status must be constantly submitted. This means that your entire activities can be permanently monitored and monitored. A life-threatening step towards unfreedom, the terrifying sequel of which is not difficult to see either. Because already there is a lot of talk about other types of lockdowns. For example, by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, which advocated climate lockdowns to reduce our CO2 emissions, where it is carefully determined per person how much meat you can eat, how much you can travel and ""who drives electric could shower a little longer again."" First via an app, then perhaps a bracelet that registers your 'emissions'? How big is the step, from a corona QR society to a climate QR society? We were already used to the fact that we had to show our QR code everywhere, weren't we?

11. WHERE DOES THAT LEAD IN THE LONG TERM? In China, we see what such a QR company can mean in the long term. There, an advanced social credit system rewards 'good' behaviour, while 'bad' behaviour is punished. Using high-speed internet, smart technology and identification of individual citizens via smartphones and facial recognition, the Chinese state can follow every step you take. If you have positions that the regime does not like, you will receive penalty points so that certain facilities are no longer allowed for you.

12. WOULD IT REALLY... BE A TRANSITION? 

No one can predict the future with certainty. But the power that the government gets in such a QR society is immense - and life-threatening. We do not trust her to do so. We've seen over the past year and a half how something can start as a ""lockdown of a few weeks"" and extend to where we are today. And isn't it also striking how smoothly we are guided there? How much did they seem to know from the beginning of the corona situation that this would be the outcome? Was it even about public health, about making people better, about preventing deaths? If so, why ban drugs like HCQ and Ivermectin? Why not seriously scale up in healthcare? Why stubbornly continue to deny that the mortality of the virus has turned out to be much lower than originally thought? Why push all citizens into the vaccine pump, including those who have already had it (and who are therefore immune)?

We are experiencing a transition from late liberalism to neo-communism. From all sides we see how the classic capitalism of director-owners and SMEs is giving way to a kind of corporatism in which Big Government and Big Business go hand-in-hand and from semi-monopolies rig up an all-powerful conglomerate of rules, subsidies, taxes and permits. Property is increasingly being managed centrally by giant investment companies. Savings evaporate due to central bank buyback and reprint programs. Owner-occupied homes are becoming unaffordable. 'You'll own nothing and be happy'. A transition. A 'great reset'. A new world in which governments and multinationals have become the owners of life, of people.

In this 'transition' to a new era, the rest of the trans-thinking also fits seamlessly: the transnational institutions, the depopulation via mass immigration, the transformation of our historical identity by BlackLivesMatter and mandatory ""diversity quotas"", the 'energy transition' and the promotion of transgender people and transhumanism. Call it zeitgeist. Call it a fashion that grips elites around the world. But the trend is unmistakable and visible across the board.

CONCLUSION 

We live in exceptional times. Never before have such draconian measures been taken as we have seen in 2020-2021. Never in history have entire populations been locked up in their homes, subject to social distancing rules, shops and cafes have been closed, face masks have become mandatory, and the giving of medical data became conditional for access to social life.

We see the first steps in the formation of a control society. An unfree world in which we constantly have to get the approval of the state to do things. The vaccination passports are a necessary, essential step for this development to continue. If people refuse en masse - and this does not require violence or insurrection - then the QR society cannot come into being. Then we stop it. That's why we're calling for it: if it's not really necessary for your health, don't take that vaccine. And if you take it anyway: refuse the 'app' and the QR code.

Of course he makes money off this conspiracy theory by selling water filters.

Recently many main stream media sources have published articles discussing the effects of chemicals that are in plastics. And of course there was the major court case finding round-up was responsible for one man's cancer.

So it appears that Alex was correct. This acknowleges of course that he create no original content but merely identified previously published material that supported his assertion about the dangers of chemicals.

So, the prevailing theory for his silencing is that MSM is liberal,  and he is not, so they silenced him. I believe the simple answer is that Monsanto has more to lose from Jones than the Democrats, and they have more money.

With Star Trek Discovery you really can see the SJW touches and it is no wonder with Bryan Fuller at the helm. However, it is good to watch too. The more it gets into the series, it has a lot more story and less PC/SJW references, thank goodness!

So, has anyone watch The Orville, do you agree?

A detail about the ad made me want to see what new turd Hollywood managed to produce.

[You won't be disappointed with the new, woke, fairy godmother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1NeHRuPpoM)

They will destroy every bit of Western culture. That's their objective. 

They are already actively trying to destroy Tolkien's work. The lord of the rings has been feeding the imagination and dreams of millions of Westerners (and probably beyond). We can't have that. They have to destroy it. [As a reminder, here is what the recent seminar of the Tolkien society was about](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/society/events/seminar/):

> Gondor in Transition: A Brief Introduction to Transgender Realities in The Lord of the Rings

> Applying Traumatic Stress and Ecological Frameworks to Narratives of Displacement and Resettlement Across Cultures in Tolkien’s Middle-earth

> Tolkien’s Dwarf-Women and the ‘Feminine Lack’

> The Lossoth: Indigeneity, Identity, and Antiracism

> Pardoning Saruman?: The Queer in Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings

I can already tell you how the new Cinderella production ends : the fairy godmother bangs cinderella. The white king feels humiliated. The whole, culturally diverse, crowd cheers, and calls it a win for democracy. Some character probably breaks into a church at some point too, to spit on the priest, or something like that. 

In case you hadn't found enough valid reasons to throw that shit called a TV into the bin yet. Do your child a favour : read the Cinderella story to her (the original one). And if you want to teach about African culture, there are nice books about it too. This kind of shows is not about celebrating differences, it's about destroying cultures.",conspiracy,Transgender

This is in no way a knock on gay or transgendered people, if you truly believe you were born this way I say thumbs up do what you have to do. Some of you were unsure or undecided, looking for a solution to life's problems, and found a community of support. That's totally fine too if that's what works for you. I have transgendered family and gay friends, love them and don't criticize their choice .

But I do share my opinion, am not scared to have a conversation. I believe a significant percentage of people get pushed or manipulated into this decision.

I certainly agree and believe there are gay/trans people who truly were born gay/trans, feel born with it. But they are a very, very small percentage of humanity, minuscule. Many people have latched on and accepted into the movement. They instantly belong to/stand for something. A mask to hide their insecurities and confusion, instantly become part of a protected class, feel free.Jumping on this bandwagon is fills an empty hole inside, very similar to joining a religion. For some it IS a religion, their very reason to exist.

I strongly believe there is a ulterior goal and plan to they the globalist elite to push insecure or uncertain people to abandon tradition, and choose transgenderism. They push the solution through media, doctors and therapists, by chemicals in food and water, and even peer pressure/acceptance. 

The doctors. media, etc. don't push because of malice, they believe it's noble and kind to advocate their position. They don't think about the bigger picture , about what or who is behind the explosive growth of the alternative lifestyle movement.

This recent (since 2007/08 or so) and major push toward  Trans/Homosexual/ bisexual lifestyle was it in place at this time by design. 

The goal is not to make the world a better place in the long term. In fact the suicide rate for Trans people is something like 60%. The global elite isn't pushing this for your personal happiness and health.

The current goal is to destroy the family unit.  Damage it beyond repair. It's a form of population control, limiting reproduction in first world countries.

They are doing the same thing in Japan, but in another form. They emasculated Japanese men to the point of stagnation, the future of the country is under threat due to lack of future generations.

And that's what Trans is being used  for in the west, to stop future generations of Westerners, the kids who would grow up and protect western sovereignty and culture don't exist, they hope, at least not enough to be a threat.

Smaller population blends nicely...actually goes hand in hand with their plans to flooding these countries with Islamic refugee immigrants, who are not only opposed to homosexuality they murder people for it.

Once the immigrant have a sizable population they will start to murder and terrorize the now significant homosexual population, wiping out a large number of the native population with religious vindication. And also makes it easier to control the small native family units, who have been having less and less children and marriages.  The families will be forced to convert or die like the ""sinners"" before them. 

American/ western culture has historically not put up with tyranny and stood up for freedom. By wiping out families and the population, the globalists   trying to end Americana and sovereignty won't have to worry about people fighting their oppression.  Then they will build their globalist army and wipe out their Global Islamic Sharia Caliphate.  

The plan is no secret, refer to the georgia guidestone , Denver airport, Bank Of America HQ, Rockefeller Center, LA Library, etc they have spelled it out to us plain as day, once you have the eyes to see. 




TLDR;
The globalists push alternative sexuality, which reduces middle class reproduction. Then have the Islamic caliphate wipe out the homosexuals. Then wipe out middle class western culture. Then they will will wipe out the Muslim Caliphate with their globalist government army. Then they will have their slaves and their 500 million worldwide population, and neo-feudal Elite>Slaves  economy.

After watching I was surprised and appalled by the attempt to eradicate by the LGBQT community, in essence take this man's livelihood away behind some jokes. Empathy is apparently lost as this group of heartless, hypocritical bunch of idiots who not only tries to cancel a very talented master of laughter, but in the process essentially pushed someone of their own tribe who was a friend of Dave's, a transgender who had been given the opportunity to fulfill her dream of being a comedian and opening comedy shows for Dave, to ultimately kill herself after defending Dave on Twitter and shaming her  so ruthlessly. 5 days of trampling this person on Twitter,  which isn't even a real place and Daphne threw herself off a building. The LGBQT community,  who accused Dave of being every bad thing in the world, and Daphne as well, over some jokes, ended someone's life with shame all the while purporting a lack of empathy to the conveyors of these jokes. What a clown world we live in. Comedy, while making us examine funny parts of ourselves and our world ultimately isn't real life. It's entertainment. Unfortunately these scenarios ultimately rob us from being able to see some of the masters of their craft and truly funny gifted people entertain us with their gifts because instead of just tuning out they must stifle and kill anything that they don't like because their feelings are most important. Shame someone from their own tribe literally to death, simply because they had an opportunity to follow their dream and entertain us while sharing some of theirs gifts with us to entertain us in this world which has become a society so inept at showing empathy or laughing at it itself. Anything exceptional is crushed by common people. This group of people is definitely very common and jealous and evil, not because of who they are, but because of how they act, how they treat other people, and the void of empathy rippling throughout. Those of us who get it and deeply appreciate the gifts of these exceptional people like Daphne and Dave Chappelle  and others not mentioned,  know that it is the highest crime to steal in essence what is most important to these people...their livelihood. But also there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

180,Britain Set to Increase Female Prisoners’ Sentences for ‘Misgendering’ Trans Inmates,11.0,q6c4wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/q6c4wx/britain_set_to_increase_female_prisoners/,10.0,1634006229.0,"New prison regulations in the United Kingdom will potentially enable judges to give female inmates more time in prison for “misgendering” transgender inmates.

Justice Minister Simon Wolfson announced that inmates could see their sentences extended for declining to identify trans inmates by their preferred gender. Britain is one of the few countries, along with the United States, to imprison transgender convicts with inmates of their chosen gender. This policy has led to sexual assaults and beatings, with some male inmates seeking a way out of a men’s prison through declaring themselves transgender.

So-called ‘lord’ Wolfson had announced that inmates who refer to trans inmates by their biological gender will be punished under rules barring “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” in British prisons, with prison authorities given license to suspend parole or even increase their sentences for violations. Cases of misgendering will be evaluated on a case by case basis, with exceptions seemingly provided to prisoners who didn’t know any better. The British court system had rejected a legal challenge this summer to bar inmates convicted of violent or sex offenses from being housed with female inmates.

California female inmates have accused the state of turning them into “prey,” with inmates who fear sexual assault from biologically male inmates merely given condoms by correctional staff.

She's the caricature of a leftist we all get to laugh at.

Then there's the issue of raising racial and cultural concerns so much higher than economic and class-based ones, that it's a fucking joke.  Think about it.  How often do modern politicians on the left mention class?  Almost never, except in the context of race (think Biden saying poor people are just as smart as white people).  In Biden's deformed brain black = poor, white = rich, and he's not alone in evoking similar sentiment, just not so transparently.  And people wonder why trust in institutions is at an all time low.  Pathetic.  Woke corporations attempting to curry the favor of the left are especially guilty of this shit.  It's like, yeah, we know you'd rather give a transgender person a blowjob than pay them more money, but at least be honest about it.

The left is so pathetic in this country they're on the same page as the Koch Brothers (hard right-wing libertarian billionaires) on immigration.  Yeah, never mind the fact that immigrants compete for the lower class' jobs to a large extent because they lack advanced education.  The left used to understand this at least somewhat, but the woke army has stifled even this sentiment within left wing circles.  If you're not for open borders then you hate brown people.  That's the level of logic the left operates on in this shithole.  Yeah, the largest country with the highest percentage foreign-born population, really hates brown people...

And remember Occupy Wall Street (an organic movement demanding financial justice)?  Yeah, that shit got shut down real fucking quick by the establishment left by further pushing identity politics to new heights of absurdity.

This month again saw an increase in ""Anti-Evil"" (admin) removals. Due to recent updates of the Reddit User Agreement, they are continuing to retroactively remove comments and threads on /r/conspiracy that didn't necessarily break the TOS at the time they were posted.

Here are all the documented removals from September:

* The [first removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ify9ww/ive_seen_the_term_mental_gymnastics_used_by_some/) was a thread that quoted the film Idiocracy: ""you talk like a fag and your shits all retarded"". The admins will remove any comment using these terms, even movie quotes.

* [This was removed](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iggyvj/blm_roters_tried_to_kill_a_man_after_they_set_his/g2vc5jr/), likely for sarcastic/veiled racism: "" I recommend you live in a nice black town like Detroit or Newark. Much better and much more culture!""

* [This comment was removed](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ighbpj/reddit_is_just_a_safe_space_for_approved/g2ut63i/) for using ""trans"" as a slur: ""He didn't get his info from an obese trans fluid pink,green and red haired furry with 6 different mental illnesses.""

* [Another ""faggot"" removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ikndtw/the_aunt_of_the_girl_raped_by_jacob_blake_speaks/g3o6nt9/)

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/il14wo/we_need_to_talk_about_this/g3orgdg/) was removed for a demonstrably racist over-generalization of black people as being greedy.

* The reason for the removal [of the next comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iif5qj/and_so_it_continues/g36oetf/) is unclear, as it says: ""bury it and go on with the trafficking"" which appears to be a sarcastic remark to the seeming indifference of people to breaking stories of human trafficking. 

* [The next removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ihw0qj/teen_boys_raped_and_buried_alive_in_sweden/g32uadl/) cites rape statistics in Sweden and suggests the increase is related to the migrant population of the country. It's unclear which part of this comment violates the TOS.

* [This detailed comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ihvwaa/every_record_has_been_destroyed_or_falsified/g342iuk/) comparing Hispanic and Black crime was removed. It's unclear what the TOS violation here is. OP may have been spamming.

* [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hwhp91/michael_jackson_they_dont_care_about_us_and_more/) was removed for using the triple parentheses ((())) as code for ""Jewish"". Triple parentheses are increasingly targeted by the admins...please report any instance of their use to the mods!

* This [removed comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nzr9e/til_in_2004_a_13yo_girl_was_walking_to_school_but/ds613v8/) was 2 years old at the time of the removal. The admins likely took issue with the following: ""Where are the ""decent Jews"" who should be here joining in the condemnation of these atrocities and war crimes?""

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iit8ua/after_years_of_denying_it_israel_finally_admits/g391856/) likely had multiple violations, including: ""Jewish Supremacists are also fans of genocide.""

* The next removal [of a thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iisod8/4chan_finds_a_strange_link/) is questionable. It's a link to a 4chan screenshot that discusses a synchronicity between the ""Kenosha Kid"" and a band from 2012. The term ""fags"" appears in the screenshot, but since it's not *on* reddit itself, it's unclear whether or not that prompted the removal.

* The next removal [has since been deleted, possibly by OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ilxjt2/the_guy_says_to_send_in_your_vote_by_mail_then_go/g3vvg8f/). OP had multiple personal attacks and other rule violations removed by the /r/conspiracy mods as well, so it's likely the admin-removed comment was more of the same.

* 26 days ago, [this 11-month-old comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ilxjt2/the_guy_says_to_send_in_your_vote_by_mail_then_go/g3vvg8f/) was removed for quoting a Michael Jackson song: ""Beat me, hate me You can never break me Will me, thrill me You can never kill me Jew me, sue me Everybody do me Kick me, kike me Don't you black or white me."" This may be the first removal of lyrics from a pop song.

* This [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/in0nyu/every_day_blm_becomes_a_little_bit_more_like_a/g44v41f/) was removed for violent rhetoric. OP was immediately issued a ban by the /r/conspiracy mods.

* A few days later, [this 7-month old](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fd0n5a/mike_bloombergs_twitter_bots_had_a_glitch/fjek4w2/) comment was removed for using the term ""goyim"". This may be the first admin removal of this term.

* A [similar thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f5sdkx/if_you_want_to_know_who_controls_you_learn_who/) from 7 months ago was also removed, this time for saying that ""you aren't allowed to criticize Jews.""

* The next day, [this image](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3m3lda/rabbi_kenneth_cohen_suggests_iceland_should_be/cvcf4h7/) from *5 years ago* was removed for questioning the Holocaust.

* On the same day, [this 3-year-old comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6fq6on/george_webb_i_am_a_zionist/dikh760/) was removed for using the triple parenthesis.

* Also that day, [this 4-year-old comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3w30tw/cnns_ashleigh_banfield_should_we_ban_jews_since/cxswapx/) was removed for disparaging Jewish people.

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/in0nyu/every_day_blm_becomes_a_little_bit_more_like_a/g460ixk/) was removed for claiming that ""Jews"" had subverted Germany.

* [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ilqofw/israeli_prime_minister_admits_israel_interferes/g3wrpvu/) was removed for inappropriate rhetoric against Jewish people and politicians.

* [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ipdrbg/hypocrisy_thy_name_is_zion_jewish_groups_support/g4jhrjr/) was removed for referring to ""big noses"". There are many instances of admin removals of the word ""nose"" or ""big nose"" as code for Jewish people.

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iny1jz/im_young_im_still_like_wtf_kind_of_stories_are/g4brjn6/) was removed: ""The worlds totally fucked. My 12 year old niece wants to be trans. She also has a trans boyfriend her age."" This user was temp banned by the admins for hate speech.

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iny1jz/im_young_im_still_like_wtf_kind_of_stories_are/g4b5tnr/) was removed for ""misgendering"" (calling a man a woman, or vice versa). There are also multiple instances of the admins considering this as hate speech or harassment. Admins apparently now consider using ""improper"" pronouns a violation of the User Agreement.

* The next comment removed [was from the same thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iny1jz/im_young_im_still_like_wtf_kind_of_stories_are/g4ay92j/), and has since been deleted by OP. It similarly referred to a trans woman as a ""man"" which likely prompted the removal.

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ip3094/50_people_were_shot_in_chicago_over_the_weekend/g4izru2/) was removed, likely for racist rhetoric.

* [This was removed](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inwcwe/the_russian_revolution_and_current_unrest/g4as8af/) for questioning the Holocaust.

* [The next removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inxous/meta_trump_warns_schools_teaching_1619_project/g4cfy1i/) was likely for this statement: ""For decades Jewish supremacists have used the concept of ""white privilege"" in order to blame whites for the reality of Jewish Privilege.""

* From the same thread, [a similar comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inxous/meta_trump_warns_schools_teaching_1619_project/g4cecik/) was removed discussing ""Jewish supremacy"".

* [More links](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inwcwe/the_russian_revolution_and_current_unrest/g4at4ry/) concerning ""Jewish supremacy.""

* [This 3-year-old comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67nt5e/example_of_shill_nye_pushing_this_sjw_sexuality/dgs8xl1/) was removed for homophobia: ""Men who are sexually attracted to other men can be considered to have a mental illness.""

* Also from 3 years ago, [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67nt5e/example_of_shill_nye_pushing_this_sjw_sexuality/dgs0rh2/) homophobic sentiment was removed next: ""The Gay Liberation movement has always had a pedophile/pederast contingent.""

* From the same day, [this 5-year-old comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/31larz/antiwhite_privilegeas_it_exists_today_racism_is/cq2mul5/) was removed: ""Asking a white person ""are you a racist?"" is like asking a Black person ""are you a n*****?""

* [The next comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ioheo8/what_arent_they_telling_us_about_nazi_germany/g4hwy9p/) contained inappropriate rhetoric against Jews.

* [The next removed comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/irde9x/censorship_of_the_police_killing_of_drew_edwards/g4xizrz/) was likely targeted for ""harassment"" against reddit power users. The admins rarely tolerate detailed discussion of reddit's power mods/users.

* From the same thread, [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iqspl5/after_a_day_with_2400_upvotes_and_100_comments/g4tz21s/) was also removed for ""pinging"" reddit power mods.

* [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/iqmlmi/transgender_woman_who_demanded_access_to_girls/g4uqcxq/) has since been deleted, but it likely was removed for misgendering.

* [This comment's removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j0jsjw/bulgarian_soccer_fans_hold_kyle_rittenhouse_did/g6s8qlp/) is particularly noteworthy. It states: ""Kyle is an inspiration to all good men and women."" As the individual in question is currently awaiting trial, it appears presumptive on the part of the admins to censor any opinions about this case.

* [This removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j0p8op/definitive_proof_that_reddit_news_is_curated_by/) was likely for the source  (a notorious ""white supremacist"" site). Despite the post sitting at 19% upvoted, multiple non-/r/conspiracy regulars flooded in claiming this one buried thread was ""evidence"" of /r/conspiracy's ""decline"". The manipulation here should be self-evident.

* [The next removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j0r3sr/the_man_who_spent_years_lecturing_to_schools/g6w0029/) was likely for this: ""Shocked, you mean to tell me a Jew lied about the Holocaust?""

* [This comment was removed](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j10exi/thoughts_not_sure_if_this_is_real_or_not_but_it/g6y1g92/) for thinly-veiled racism (this same OP has already been banned).

* [This removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j0qsno/the_simple_truth_in_digestible_trending_meme_form/g6uv3kh/) has since been deleted. It was likely for this sentiment: ""pedo shit and gay shit being pushed everywhere""

* [The final removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fatlv9/you_ever_wondered_who_is_behind_the_extremely/fj1lb08/) from that day is a 7-month-old comment that used the triple parenthesis. 

* [The most recent removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j2bon8/the_southern_poverty_law_center_a_jew_con_job_if/) from 7 hours ago was a thread titled: ""The Southern Poverty Law Center, A Jew Con Job if there ever was one.""

That's the lot of admin removals recorded in the mod log for this month! Due to a lack of communication on the part of the admin team, we have to use these removals as the template for gauging what is considered in ""violation"" of the User Agreement. 

As the mod team struggles to keep up with the vicissitudes of what the admins deem to be ""acceptable"" speech, it would help if the *users* also help us by reporting similar content, even if you may not personally find it offensive or disagreeable. This includes ""pinging"" power users, the use of the triple parenthesis ((())), and ""misgendering"" or transphobia. 

By reporting this content, we can keep admin intervention on this sub to a bare minimum.

185,How the word “gender” was hijacked by post modern ideologies.,11.0,91f9d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/91f9d5/how_the_word_gender_was_hijacked_by_post_modern/,74.0,1532416961.0,"In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead. But the post modern interpretation of the difference between sex and gender is irrational and unscientific because of biology and worldwide historical precedent. 

For example, no other language in the world (except closely related to English) distinguishes the difference between sex and gender. Try to translate the word sex or gender into another language and there is only one word for it. Some languages like Spanish even genders their nouns to masculine and feminine. 
The label “transgender” can be translated and this group of people have existed throughout history, among all groups of people. 
Today the word gender has been weaponized to somehow imply there are more than 2 sexes/genders. Meaningless words like genderqueer, genderless or gender neutral were introduced. The fact is, an individual cannot force society to separate sex from social/gender roles that are attached to it, since these familial roles are essential for reproduction and an integral part of the social fabric. These gender/sex roles were used throughout all human history regardless of location. This fundamental subversion of social norms is used to further divide the people so they are distracted from the real issues and fragmented groups are easier to manipulate. Pseudo-intellectuals are paid to endorse transient and sterile relationships and this will weaken the social order. 
Ultimately the post modernists are working for the interests of the oligarchs than the interests of the general public. ",conspiracy,Transgender

188,The establishment is smearing Bernie's base as racist and homophobic because they can't get Bernie anywhere on policy or substance,10.0,d87xls,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d87xls/the_establishment_is_smearing_bernies_base_as/,29.0,1569251933.0,"**edit to add: I understand if you don't like Bernie. My point is that obviously unfair attacks are being launched against his campaign to trick people that would otherwise like him.

You don't have to like Bernie to observe what's happening here and think it's fucked up.

Some people here are probably already aware the Working Families Party has endorsed Warren in this primary, where they endorsed Sanders previously. A lot of Sanders supporters were suspicious about this, especially because the vote to choose the endorsement weighted leadership votes as 50%, and membership votes as 50%.

Last election, they released vote totals. This election, they're saying that would be divisive, and that people critical of the 50/50 weighting of the final total are saying leadership votes don't matter (when what they're actually saying is individual leadership votes shouldn't matter 200 times more than individual membership votes.)

After calls for the vote totals to be released, and many tweets pointing out that Sanders objectively does more for working families, the Working Families Party put out a [statement condemning racist harassment](https://time.com/5681261/working-families-party-harassment) from Bernie supporters. I've seen 3 messages including things like ""uncle tom"" and ""slave,"" two from people of color, but Working Families Party leadership characterized the ""harassment"" as ""White terror.""

Angelica Ross was the host of the recent LGBTQ forum, which Sanders did not attend, as it was the day of the climate protests which were planned months in advance and he was already booked. She took to twitter to use this moment to question his commitment to the LGBTQ community. 

Many Sanders supporters did not appreciate this characterization, pointed out he has the best record of supporting the LGBTQ community, and has been consistent on that since the 80s.

Headline of article about this event: [**Angelica Ross Leaves Twitter After Abuse by Trump, Sanders Supporters**](https://www.out.com/transgender/2019/9/22/angelica-ross-leaves-twitter-after-abuse-trump-sanders-supporters)

Tweets cited by Out showing Sanders supporters ""abuse"":

* So are you insinuating Bernie DOES NOT care about the LGBTQ community? If so ,then  you are using your platform to spread MISINFORMATION about a man who has always been on the side of the LGBTQ community. You dont have to like him but dont play loose with the truth.

* To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him. He's been an ally before it was cool and socially acceptable, while every other candidate just hopped on the equality train. Warren was a Republican not to longago

* Now don’t get me wrong I’m not calling any democratic candidate homophobic, I just don’t like how @angelicaross assumed Bernie to be homophobic by charging him with this MINOR offense. By her definition a lot of candidates are transphobic, including the ones she praises...

Not to mention, she literally is still on twitter, and has not left due to ""abuse by Trump, Sanders supporters."" The headline, and primary impression, remains; this black woman was chased off twitter by Sanders supporters because they're just so racist and homophobic and mean.


The establishment has realized that the only way to attack Bernie's policies in the primary is to say they're too ambitious. No one can argue that his plans aren't ambitious enough, or that he's compromised by big money, or that he's too old (thanks Biden). There is not a solid attack plan for the Democratic party to use against this guy. 

So they're smearing his base. 

I don't want to be part of the only democratic voter base that's consistently going on racist and homophobic tirades, do you?",conspiracy,Transgender

On the Camino de Santiago of all places, a walk which, along one of its many routes at least, spans the entire breadth of Spain. I’d flown into Bilbao a short time before and had made my way to the French Pyrenees, where in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port I prepared for the 770 kilometre walk to Santiago de Compostela.

It must have been about a month in, but somewhere around Leon, I got up one morning to go and get coffee. Walking days start early, so it was around seven in the morning when I found a little café and sat down. There was a small fifteen-inch television in the place and news played on repeat, the footage that of the plane smashing into the first tower. I caught the eye of the café owner and the two of us stared at each other in disbelief. That’s all I remember of the event and its aftermath.

A few years back a British journalist got into hot water for calling it the greatest televisual event of all time (or something to that effect), but in one sense that’s what it was. No Hollywood production could rival it for pure exhilarating violence; it was ‘spectacular’, in the true and original (etymological) sense of the word.

It was Jean Baudrillard who penned the essay ‘The Gulf War did not take place’ ([PDF link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjEsbXr3fnyAhVDPuwKHWNiBZAQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fflatbushcommons.org%2Fs%2FJean-Baudrillard-The-Gulf-War-Did-Not-Take-Place.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2MKJRO4XjSl19QaeHJ34hA) for those interested), a piece about how the entire war was only given concrete reality by a furious and sustained propaganda campaign. I cannot comment on what extent American lives are shaped by the media (my guess is quite considerably), but it seems striking to me now that media-driven American war then became the war on America, the event announced also with a televisual extravaganza, perhaps the greatest ever seen. After that, who could oppose the subsequent twenty-year global war of terror where millions of (mostly Muslim) lives were lost to the fury of America’s thirst for revenge, a war (or series of wars) which, in retrospect, seemed to have been in the planning for quite some time?

My own views on 9/11 probably now border on the prosaic. I find the official narrative to be a piece of absurd contrivance. It seems to me that the event could not have happened without its own fair amount of (internal) advanced planning. That the towers fell as a result of [controlled demolition](https://www.ae911truth.org/evidence/near-free-fall-acceleration) seems beyond doubt, and once that is established, one is forced down a whole series of scary rabbit holes. But who cares? Twenty years later, the story has been buried in the rubble and no one much wants to go digging anymore. People’s attention span is short and there’s always another atrocity to hypnotise us for a few short seconds, and if no tragedy exists, then we’ll find some other inane bullshit to latch onto. Transgender weightlifters, for example. And tomorrow, the story will be much the same: Who cares?

I hope that the people of New York and America find out the truth one day, and not so far down the line that the response is the one I have paraphrased above. But it’s, what, fifty years since Kennedy was shot? And by the time the truth is admitted to by the state (10, 20, or 50 years from now), there will be nobody around who truly gives a damn. But I also hope that the cycle of ‘blood for blood’ comes to an end, too; the 200 dead Afghans in Kabul only a few weeks ago would suggest we are far from there yet and it shows no sign of slowing.

We live in a visual world and we are mostly anaesthetized to media depictions of violence. But whereas we in the West see most of our massacres onscreen, those in the global East are well-used to carrying their bleeding dead in their arms. Other than army personnel, 9/11 was the first and only time that people of the US were subjected up close to warfare, and for that reason it leaves such a massive psychological imprint on modern lives and will likely do so for years to come.

We do not live war, but for one brief moment in 2001, we all did. But largely because of neo-colonialist policies by Western governments, there are those in the world who live with it continually. We suffered once, they suffer daily, weekly, yearly. And if we don’t like it, all we have to do is turn off our TV. They don’t have the luxury.",conspiracy,Transgender

Society is causing this problem. for the arguments sake lets just say there were no conspiracy linked directly to the shooter to cause what he was doing.  We call out these loner incel types and make fun of them because they depressed like they are just some small minority of the population. But all we hear about is this mental health crisis and how a large percentage of society is going through this. 

So the media covers this extensively This guy is already feeling frustrated like many other people. Every other week he sees another mass shooting on TV. When the news stations broadcast it  they set the tone like they are so disgusted how could this individual do it. Then they post their fucking manifestos only validating the entire reason these shooters did it. No one was listening to them they feel like they are an outcast to society. They see the attention the others shooters are getting and see it as the only way they will be heard. The media continues to validate them by spreading their message to the masses.  Following the last few mass shooting reports he realizes he doesn't even have to die. I guess the door to mass shooting needed to be made more accessable to a wider audience  so not every mass shooter needs to end in suicide or getting shot by authorities He goes in the store takes out as many as he can knowing he can just surrender as soon as any law enforcement arrive. He he grabs a stash  of popcorn he bought through commissary  and takes some of those smuggled in drugs that run rampant in the prison system. He turns on the news and its everything he ever wanted, Hes on fucking TV, Yeah hes in jail and that can suck but he no longer has to worry about working a job and the stresses of financial insecurity. Everything is provided for him. He never was able to get women outside of jail so its not really as big of a deal. Society  has not only made being gay or transgender not only social acceptable but despite his terrible crimes he has the option to go trans Manning has paved that path, Eventually he can blame is frustration on society not accepting who he really was and some will see him as a hero just taking out the frustrations of society lack of acceptance and if bruce jenners transition is an example to go buy then yes you can be forgiven for murder if you are a trans person.

 Once again the cycle continues as a thought germ.  Another frustrated youth walks out of his thereapy appointment with his prescription of anti depressants in hand. The doctor is telling him  how effective these meds with his counseling sessions.  He feels hopeless because regardless of what the Doctor and therapists are saying he feels like  hes not getting any better. How could he both the Dr and Counselor hes saying relate to him at all they live in an entirely different financial class and are  mostly likely only have to pretend they can relate to him based on some techniques they learned in their training. They have never been through what he has.  What he needs is someone that has walked through his shoes, someone that has been through the same hardships and were able to turn their life around without going off the deep end.",conspiracy,Transgender

I was thinking about Bill Clinton and how he was successfully impeached in the 1990s. The sad thing is that he was never impeached for his many violations of the Constitution. It required a sexual imbroglio for his political enemies to be able to take him down in Congress.

As we now watch his wife vie for the same office, we see a pattern emerge. Like her husband, she's almost openly corrupt. She has violated numerous laws--and in particular Article 1, section 9 of the US Constitution. Yet flagrantly breaking the law doesn't seem to be a disqualification for running for the Presidency. (This is something unprecedented in our history.) Yet if some tape turned up of her using a racial slur, she'd be gone overnight.

And that's when the realization hit me: We have this second set of [unwritten] laws grafted over top of our official law. Violate the Constitution and ""No problem!"" Use the N-word, and you're gone.

But here's the thing: As vile as a racial slur is, it's not actually illegal.

Calling a transgender a ""he"" [when he prefers to be called a ""she""] is not illegal.

Referring to someone in the country illegally as a ""foreigner"" is not illegal.

All of these taboos have been exalted over and above our ACTUAL laws.

A President can casually violate every law in the Constitution and there will be no consequences whatsoever from Congress. But violate the ""speech codes"" of the Frankfurt School Marxists who hijacked our culture, and boom: You're gone.

And with that realization, I knew that we've been taken over--our nation hijacked from people OUTSIDE our culture. Individuals inimical to it. 

Gone is the nation's concept of ""Rule of Law"". We're now ruled by dogma. Unwritten laws.

(We operate officially as if the old rules are in place, as if the old institutions haven't been compromised. But it's only window dressing. Scratch the surface and you discover pretty quickly that there's  lot of wisdom in that axiom: ""To learn who rules over you, learn whom you are not allowed to criticize."")

Or in other words, to learn what your country's REAL laws are, learn which violations will end your career, or earn you social and political ostracism.

In summation: Our official laws may be written down, but they are dead because they are never enforced. The only enforced laws are the unwritten rules that are handed down by the shadowy ""legislators"" whom no American actually elected (yet who rule with an iron fist, and from whose tyranny there is no appeal).",conspiracy,Transgender

The Democratic leadership has not announced a unified view on the policy especially since it was just announced though individual members have already spoken out - mostly against it. One view may be that the Democrats' base has always been very socially progressive, and it would play to the party's strengths to play this issue up. On the other hand, the party has recently weathered intense criticism that it is already focusing too much on social justice policy which has cost them the votes of working-class moderates.

This was seen with his supporters adoring his strong man act and fighting against democrats at every turn.  Since then, the Republican Party has heavily leaned into strategy.  DeSantis rise from a largely unknown politician to governor was due to his large support to trumps policies.  Texas politicians have led the way for adopting aggressive Republican policies. South Dakota governor aggressively pushed against any sort of action against covid.  The list of passed policies and actions are numerous with blanket refusal of cooperation towards investigations, passing tax cuts for the rich, pushing against election results, passing laws to make it more difficult for voting, putting more election power in the hands of republicans, banning abortion at 6 weeks, banning mask mandates, banning critical race theory or other studies regarding race, banning transgender athletes from participating in athletics, to blocking Supreme Court nominations and heavily gerrymandering congressional districts.  

This political strategy has proven t be extremely divisive.  Supporters on the right have heavily praised their politicians and a common response from republicans is “elections have consequences”.  Their opponents heavily attack these politicians with a variety of critical attacks.  When it comes down to it, the large majority of these policies range from being mildly unpopular to heavily distasteful rom the general public.  

The question is, is this strategy politically savy or suicide?  The most notorious example for this is the North Carolina bathroom bill.  This likely resulted inthe governor losing the next election.  I’m 2018 there was a strong backlash with a democratic wave.  In 2020 democrats won Georgia due to motivation risen from losing the 2018 election.  Yet despite this, republicans have maintained legislative control in NC and won the house, senate and presidency in 2016, gained senate seats in 2018 over performed expectations in 2020 for house and state elections.  There is a strong sentiment that republicans are expected to easily retake the house in 2022.  Republicans have also shown to consistently maintain control over state governments across the US.  So while republicans may lose some battles, on the whole the general public does not punish the Republican Party.  On the contrary that their base is more devoted than ever.

>Just minutes before House Bill 1523 was to take effect at midnight, (U.S. District Judge Carlton W.) Reeves eviscerated the bill — the most sweeping attempt by a state to undermine the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to legalize gay marriage — as being in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

From Reeves:

>Religious freedom was one of the building blocks of this great nation, and after the nation was torn apart, the guarantee of equal protection under law was used to stitch it back together. But HB 1523 does not honor that tradition of religion freedom, nor does it respect the equal dignity of all of Mississippi’s citizens. It must be enjoined.

>The State has put its thumb on the scale to favor some religious beliefs over others. Showing such favor tells non adherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and . . . adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community. And the Equal Protection Clause is violated by HB 1523’s authorization of arbitrary discrimination against lesbian, gay, transgender, and unmarried persons. The plaintiffs’ motions are granted and HB 1523 is preliminarily enjoined.

How this will end up working now:

>The preliminary injunction will hold until any appeals are completed. Then, if upheld, they will be filed as permanent injunctions.

Some background on the bill:

>The bill, officially titled as the “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,” was authored by state House Speaker Philip Gunn (R).

>His resulting bill easily passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate. Gov. Phil Bryant (R)...signed it April 5.

>It sought to protect Mississippians who had three specific religious beliefs: That marriage was between one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples and that gender is determined at birth. Court clerks would be allowed to deny marriage licenses to same sex couples by asserting a religious offense. A single mother could be fired from her job. Any private business owner could refuse service to anyone they perceived to be gay by citing the above religious beliefs.

So how far reaching is this going to be? Is this going to lead to increased protection from discrimination for the LGBT community, or is this more or less an isolated incident? Could this be used to/does this ultimately put sexuality in the same protected class as things like speech and religion?

Bills banning surgery for transgender minors will carve out exceptions for cisgender minors and for nonconsenting DSD babies. Why should it be illegal for a transgender 17-year-old who identifies as male to get their breasts removed, but legal for a cisgender 17-year-old who identifies as female to get breast augmentation? Are those not both forms of gender affirming surgery performed on minors? Why include carve-outs perming infants with ambiguous genitalia to be surgically operated on when banning such procedures for teens old enough to advocate their own position on the topic?

Is this simple hypocrisy on the past of hyperpartisan politicians, or is there an actual reason that these carve-outs and exceptions should exist, and if so, why is that missing more or less entirely from the public debate?

Reminder: Dwayne Johnson has had gender affirming surgery performed on his chest.

However, when the Amendment passed Congress and went to the ratification process, it stipulated a 7 year window, which ended in 1979.  That was later extended to 1982, but was not met.  Moreover, several states rescinded the ratification of the amendment.

So this brings a number of Constitutional questions that have never been asked:

1. Was it valid for Congress to set a time limit? \[Edit: Has been answered in the affirmative\]
2. If the time limit was valid, and Congress passes a law reopening ratification, do states need to re-ratify the law?
3. Are states allowed to rescind ratification of an amendment?
4. Kentucky's governor vetoed the rescinding of ratification - but the constitution gives ratification power to state legislatures, not governors.  Under the US Constitution, does the governor have that power?

Besides all these questions, there's also a deeper question:

1. We have a case before the Supreme Court over the proper interpretation of Title VII's phrase prohibiting discrimination ""on the basis of sex.""  The Obama administration used this phrase to expand discrimination protections to sexual orientation, and one of the cases being argued at the Supreme Court wants to expand that phrase to protect a transgender person's right to wear clothes matching their gender identity.  Conservatives, on the other hand, point out that these situations are not what a plain reading of the statute says, and not what the people who passed it intended.

He sued under Title IX, the federal law that requires that federally-funded educational institutions not discriminate based on sex.  In the past several years, many transgender people have sued when being discriminated against, specifically being barred from the gender-segregated facilities that match their gender identity; they have often argued that they were victims of sex discrimination.  While few states explicitly protect ban discrimination against trans people, many have argued that current federal laws already do.  (Some have argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already bans transgender discrimination on the grounds of it being sex discrimination, but this discussion is primarily about sex discrimination and trans discrimination in schools).

First off the law will likely be overturned by courts. Laws similiar to this have been overturned in the past, and this type of thing is fairly straightforward.

Let me oversimplify a bit and define ""transgender"" as someone born biologically as one sex who identifies as the opposite gender. 

And now let's (again, somewhat simplifying) divide these people into 2 groups: 

A) People who *have not* changed their outward appearance,  and still look like their biological birth sex.
B) People who *have* changed their outward appearance, and now look like their identified gender (and opposite of their birth sex).

My take is that the laws are trying to counter people in group ""A"" who want to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. For example a (biological) man who identifies as a woman but looks like a man, using the women's bathroom. ""I don't want [someone who looks like] a man in the women's bathroom.""

But by mandating that you use the bathroom of your biological sex, doesn't that create an analogous ""problem"" in group B? Now you can have someone who was born a woman, but looks and feels like a man, including those who have undergone full gender reconstruction surgery, forced to use the women's bathroom. 

From an ""outward appearance"" perspective, they wanted to get rid of ""men"" using the women's bathroom (and vice versa) but now they've mandated this very thing for a large group of people.

Which is great (if you're concerned about that thing, of course… which I am), but what happens next?

Seems a bit overdramatic, but the point still stands that the LGBTQ+ community has so many issues beyond marriage, in the political and social spheres. Still so many people believe bisexuals are 'just experimenting', and few people accept asexuality as a real thing. Most people think within the gender-binary, so genderqueer (non-binary) people still have to identify as male or female in identification forms, bathrooms, and… life. Discrimination in the workplace, school, and public is awful. The kicker for me is that the average life of a transgender person is about 30. And the list goes on and on.

>The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.

So if you rewind 10 years back, the biggest talking point among the right-wing circles was how Muslims were the number one enemy of the United States, how ""Shariah Law"" was going to be implemented in America, Muslim immigrants were seen as a big problem, people like Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller were prominent. The so-called ""Ground Zero Mosque"" was a big dividing point among Americans. This hatred against Muslims really entered popular consciousness around 9/11 and then peaked around 2012 plateauing into the rise of Trump and the War against ISIS. 

But today, it seems that Muslims are no longer a talking point among the right-wing Americans. Instead their attention has turned against ""Liberals"" as a whole, against things like critical race theory, transgender controversies, gender ideologies, LGBT stuff. The right-wing echo chambers and talking heads focus entirely on how evil Biden and the Democrats are. There is continued hatred of Muslims but it gets subsumed into a wider hatred and disdain of immigrants as a whole I've noticed. 

This is probably attributed to a few things. The rapid and easy defeat of ISIS probably showed most Americans that radical Islam could never pose a threat to the United States. The New Zealand Mosque Shootings probably made some people realize they've gone too far with their talking points. And the political polarization in America reached such extreme levels that the right-wing stopped caring about Muslims. COVID may have also played a role where it was a massive global event that took attention away from 20 years of news focusing on radical Islamic terrorists, and the right-wing focused their attention on fighting mask and vaccine mandates instead. Plus America no longer being involved in Iraq or Afghanistan and the news cycle eager to move on from those topics.

**CASE STUDIES**

For this sort of discussion, I do not think it is very helpful to look only at the bird’s eye abstract considerations of how we should treat trans youth in general.  So, we’re going to be considering how the government should be involved in the lives of *specific transgender children*.  These children are hypothetical, but heavily based on the perspectives of transgender people who I personally know or have read the accounts of.  This is not a representative sample of transgender children, but rather are constructed to make interesting and realistic case studies for discussing contemporary political issues.  I can guarantee that similar youth exist and are trying to live their lives in the United States.

Each of the names is a link to a comment below with a more detailed description of the youth.  Please keep discussions of the case studies to the replies of those comments, to keep the discussion organized.  Use top-level responses to discuss government treatment of trans youth in general.

**DISCUSSION PROMPTS** In what ways should the government be involved in these trans adolescents' lives?  Keep in mind that “no involvement” isn’t a viable answer unless you want to abolish public schools.

Who should be making these decisions about these children?  The trans youth, parents, doctors, mental health professionals, school administration, state legislatures, national legislatures, child protective services,  state/local/federal health departments, [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-children), [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/19021/AAP-continues-to-support-care-of-transgender)

Should any of them be separated from their parents?

Should any criminal actions be taken by the government against any individuals over these cases?

A) a Clinton surrogate/plant whose goal was to throw the GOP into disarray to ensure her election, or 

B) a moderate centrist - maybe even liberal - who was only using bluster to draw populist/radical support from the right which, to be frank, is always a good strategy on the right; and who was going to throw back to center once the campaign ground down a bit (this theory emerged once he became more successful)

""Clearwater beach is beautiful,"" explained the Tampa Bay resident. ""You've gotta get up there."" There wasn't a snowball's chance in Florida that we were going to make it to Clearwater. It was six days before the Republican National Convention and there was a vague hint of a hurricane forming off the coast of Africa. Josh and I had just settled into what was Tampa's seemingly only public transportation: a rustic, rehabilitated streetcar line that travels less than three miles between the artificially populated convention center region and the slowly recovering historic district called Ybor (eee-bore) City. At one point, when we were unable to purchase our fare from a broken kiosk, the operator effectively shut down the entire streetcar line to give us a hand. 

""You guys should get out there to Clearwater for a few nights. I could give you the keys to my brother's condo. Just don't trash the place or anything."" His daughter sat a seat behind him, staring at us over the top of a comically large beach ball, clutched in her lap. She shot her dad a skeptical glance. Josh and I were struck. We'd just met this guy minutes before. I think we'd won his trust when we revealed that we were with PBS. Perhaps it was impossible for him to imagine Bob Ross and Big Bird treating his brother's property with disrespect. ""Oh man! Thanks, but I wish we could. We'll be working around the clock for the next few days. Maybe next time."" 

At the end of the line was our stop, right outside the Tampa Bay Times Forum. Crews there had erected a two block-long walkway with an aluminum skeleton and vinyl walls. This was to be an air-conditioned passage between the two main venues of the RNC, the Convention Center (HQ for the media here to cover the spectacle) and the Forum (the site of the Spectacle.)

Working the Republican and Democratic conventions back to back makes it impossible to avoid drawing comparisons. The ethnic makeup of attendees, the varying levels of security, the viscosity of the catered food--- countless details your brain tries to organize and sort. It's an attempt to make sense of the two different world views driving the convention organizers. For me, there was a fascinating juxtaposition between the two convention entrances. 

In Tampa, attendees traversed that two block long passage; carpeted with electric blue astroturf, and eventually decorated inside with sashes, fifty giant hanging baskets of red roses, multicolored LED mood lighting and a string of TV monitors playing corporate ads for different Florida-based multinationals. I say eventually, because the threat of the impending hurricane kept the walkways in a near-constant state of construction and reconstruction. At one point, the roof was blown off of a section, only to be repaired the next day. 

By the time they were complete, the passages felt like a cross between a Labor day tent sale at a local Chevy Dealer, and the late Moammar Gadhafi's traveling residence. 

After emerging from the passage, the faint scents of roses and vinyl trailing behind, attendees were whisked through a magnetometer. At this point in the entrance process I missed the opportunity to snap one of the greatest photos ever taken at a Republican political convention. An earnest, 50 year old woman was dressed head to toe as a traditional Lady Liberty, circa Robespierre. Her thick velvet robes and brass buckles, not to mention layers of 19th century makeup were giving the security personnel a bit of difficulty. She was walking trompe l'oeil. As lady liberty stood spread wide, and was wanded by a 20-something cop, I raised my lens to fire of a few snaps. ""Tap, tap…"" A gentle hand grasped my shoulder. ""Please, no photos in the security line sir."" Of course. 

After clearing security, attendees walked across a plaza outside the front of the Times Forum. Here, open tents covered large fans blowing a fine mist of water at high velocity, creating swirling vortexes of disappointingly not-so-cool air. Perched in the structure of the tents and fans were robotic blue and red party lights, twisting and dancing through the swirling mist, painting the last 20 yards before the entrance to the forum. The effect was otherworldly. The tent passage and security line had opened into a misty, mystical gateway, filled with tri-corner hatted tea partiers, barking Ron Paul supporters and party magnates sporting $3,000 suits. 

The passage into the RNC was transcendent. But once inside the building, hyperreality took charge. The 2008 RNC had been a disaster in terms of light and color. The arena was unevenly lit, leaving network TV cameras with few good angles. John McCain delivered his nomination speech standing in front of a giant Crayola green background. Yes, green. Whoever designed the 2012 convention learned from those mistakes. 

Deke, our lighting director pointed out at the arena. ""They really did it this year."" He said. ""This is so much warmer, so much better light."" Deke was right. Every inch of the Arena was bathed in ultra bright televison-quality light. Walking across the floor, your corneas lit up like liquid crystals. You could feel photons exploring every pore of your skin, but all you could do was look around and absorb. The massive video screens behind the stage surged with crimson reds, golden yellows, and soft parchment whites. The floor, carpeted in bright red, throbbed with the vital light, giving the place its own heartbeat. From above, you could watch while white cowboy hats bounced and bobbed around the floor, like platelets flowing through the convention bloodstream. 

Later in the trip, I took note of the much colder light at the DNC. The blues and stark whites made Charlotte's Time Warner Center feel like the inside of an icebox. Shadows covered the back half of the arena floor. The DNC crowds managed to brighten up the setting, but the Republicans started their party with a better palette. 

What Charlotte lacked in color inside the arena, it made up for outside. The first thing you noticed on the walk into the DNC, were the vendors. There had been a handful of button hawkers in Tampa, but nothing like the street fair of tchoctke on display in Charlotte. You could buy an Obama puppet or a velvet painting of Barack Obama framed next to Dr. Martin Luther King, Fredrick Douglas and Malcolm X. Street vendors shouted out their wares ""Don't leave without a program!"" A popular item was a strangely disembodied Obama head rendered in vinyl—-a giant doll's head in search of a body. Even torrential rains didn't scare off the street vendors, they just layered plastic on top of their tables and went on hawking. 

A friend at another news organization purchased a plastic Obama statue with a bobbling head out on College St. The statue was so top-heavy it snapped off at the ankles shortly after purchase, unable to bear the burden of its own weighty bobbling head. ""I've gotta get another one of these,"" she said. I wasn't so sure a second statue would fare any better. 

Among the vendors was an active and vocal group of protesters. Much more visible than any naysayers had been in Tampa. (Though the local Tampa TV news milked the threat of ""anarchists"" roaming the city's streets for at least two weeks leading up to the RNC). The DNC protesters held a continuous vigil for their causes, their audio often showing up in the background of our recordings. They issued chants ranging from pro-life sermons to other causes I couldn't discern. At times they seemed to stand megaphone to megaphone, volleying declarations back and forth like a closed loop. 

People of all types, shapes and sizes populated the streets around the DNC. ""I think I just saw a transgender woman talking to a man with no limbs,"" said one of our reporters on the first morning of the convention. 

There wasn't just a tapestry of humanity, there was a tapestry of police in Charlotte. Security in Tampa was what you might expect: national guardsmen and police in full swat gear. But the DNC was patrolled by small groups of police from departments from across the nation. Cops had been trucked in from as far away as Philadelphia, Atlanta and Boston. Everyone noted the large contingent of police from Chicago, who had reportedly been training the Charlotte police on crowd control tactics. ""Worked so well for them in '68"" remarked a colleague. Groups of police in similar uniforms huddled together in street corners, arms length from other groups of police, in other matching uniforms. 

The most puzzling aspect of having this diaspora of police running Charlotte was that none of them seemed to know the basic layout of the city. Even when the street signs were in clear view. ""How do I get to Trayvon street from here?"" ""I have no idea, I just came in this morning from Philadelphia. Sorry buddy."" 

""What if there was a big emergency?"" a friend wondered. Would they know how to get out of the city?

I truly felt for the police, they stood for hours in pouring rain in Charlotte. The bands of hurricane precipitation had followed us from Tampa to North Carolina. At one point the rain became so heavy that our broadcast production truck sprang a leak. The teleprompter system took a bath and shut off during the live broadcast. Crew members raced to Target, bought 40 large bath towels and piled them under the leak to absorb the incoming water. 

After braving the rain and police lines, DNC attendees were funneled into the Charlotte Convention center, the true entrance to the event. There, media, delegates and sightseers walked past a large collection of official Obama/Biden 2012 merchandise for sale by the party. Lines and desire for merchandise seemed to be equal at both the RNC and DNC, though there was a wider variety of wares, catering to a broader demographic for the Democrats. I heard more complaints about the overpriced goods at the RNC, but I spent less time among the shoppers at the DNC, so it may have been equal. The goods were equally overpriced. 

Like the RNC in Tampa, the Charlotte convention center sat a fair distance from the arena where the main event would go down. To help shuttle delegates and media from one building to the other, Charlotte had dedicated a single light rail train running on its Lynx line. The sleek, modern train bounced from the arena, back to the convention center, and back to the arena, shuttling people between the two all hours. But there was a problem. The train was so slow, one could walk faster from one location to the next—which most people did when there wasn't a downpour. The result was that dozens of pedestrians spent their walk dodging a mostly empty train trying to travel, very slowly, down the same path. 

The contrasting images were too bold to ignore. Two different gateways into the artificial realities created by the parties. Rose petals, sashes and mystical lights vs. a sleek, modern, yet nearly unusable technology. One convention tried to transport us wistfully (maybe naively?) to yesterday, to a time when ""we built it."" The other demonstrated the promise of the future, partially funded by federal dollars--but ultimately walking was faster. 

Epilogue

Between the two conventions a small group of our staff worked a marathon 40 hour shift to pack and move equipment and set pieces from Tampa to Charlotte. Being PBS, we can't afford two of everything, so we have to put it on a truck and move it overnight—and begin unpacking the next morning at convention two. 

Standing outside of a suburban Tampa Bay gas station early in the morning during this process, one of our reporters, Mike, was approached by a local. ""Those are great flip-flops!"" the guy remarked. ""Can I see one?"" 

""Sure."" Mike kicked off his shoe. ""Yeah they're really ni….""

The local promptly picked up the shoe, gave the sole a top to bottom lick with his tongue—full contact—and dropped it back to the ground. 

""Then he just stared at me for a second, swiveled around and walked away,"" Mike said during a later retelling of the story. ""And the amazing thing is, another guy I know down here had the exact same thing happen to him in downtown Tampa."" That was about 25 miles away. 

For a moment I stared at my colleagues. We all pondered profound questions: What kind of diseases must that guy pick up from the soles of stranger's shoes? Could there be two flip-flop lickers in the Tampa metropolitan area? Later Mike confirmed that his acquaintance had indeed had his shoe licked by someone who fit the same description. 

""Man, I was glad to get out of Tampa that night,"" Mike said.

Trump didn't win, Rubio was so close to 2nd, Carson got way more votes than I would have expected, Bush did worse than Rand by a factor of almost 2, and the neck and neck with Clinton/Sanders was definitely unexpected for me.

However what I don't understand is how Cruz could win and win by  3%.  Either I'm out of touch with a huge segment of Americans or people are not reading up on the issues.   Cruz is an extremist by most measures and it makes no sense that so many would support him.  He seems to be pandering to people but are there really that many that can be bought with his policies?  Enough to win the Presidency?  It's amazing enough to me that he could win a Caucus.  Would he have lost if there were less candidates?

Some of the more radical ideas he has:

* Get rid of the departments of energy, education, commerce, and housing and urban development.
* Get rid of the IRS and do a 10% flat tax
* End corporate income tax and replace it with a 16% VAT
* End the Iran Nuclear deal, increase sanctions on them, and make the sanctions tougher.
* Start carpet bombing the middle east to get ISIL.  This is a war crime according to the Geneva Conventions.  He has called for airstrikes with less concern for civilian casualties as well.
* Is open to a ground invasion in the middle east to attack ISIL
* He opposes net neutrality
* Repeal Obamacare.  His alternative would not cover pre-existing conditions.
* Opposes same sex marriage and wants only those 4 states mentioned in the ruling to abide by the law with the other 46 ignoring the law.
* Opposes equal rights for transgender Americans.
* He wants the Supreme court to be elected and have term limits.
* He opposes a woman's right to choose and wants planned parenthood defunded.
* Is a climate change denier.
* Opposes the separation of church and state

35,Is it constitutional for states to ban state-funded travel to other states that pass laws they disagree with?,1.0,4cu5a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4cu5a4/is_it_constitutional_for_states_to_ban/,8.0,1459488791.0,"To quote an article from the Hartford Courant: 

>For the second time in as many years Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is banning state-funded travel to a particular state over a law he believes is discriminatory toward the LGBT community.

>Malloy signed an executive order Thursday putting an end to publicly-funded travel to North Carolina, where Republican Gov. Pat McCrory signed legislation last week that excludes protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Those pushing for the law focused on an ordinance in Charlotte that let transgender people use the restroom of their choice.

>""This law is not just wrong, it poses a public safety risk to Connecticut residents traveling through North Carolina,"" Malloy said Thursday. ""... This law endangers the welfare not just of North Carolina's citizens, but of all people visiting that state.""

>Last year, Malloy signed a similar executive order banning state-funded travel to Indiana after Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill that prohibited state laws that ""substantially burden"" the ability of someone to follow their religious beliefs. Critics said the law meant businesses could refuse to serve gays and lesbians citing a religious objections.


>Earlier this week Malloy wrote business owners in North Carolina inviting them to move their companies here in the wake of the ""discriminatory, anti-LGBT measures. ""In our state, your employees and customers would not face such institutional discrimination,"" he said. ""We are welcoming and inclusive.""

>A number of large companies have asked for the North Carolina law to be repealed, including Charlotte-based Bank of America, the largest business in the state.

How is it constitutional for Malloy to do such a thing? Does this fall under the interstate commerce clause in the constitution? Under a republican president would the government attempt to step in on such a matter?

Second, I'm not Liberal. Nor am I Conservative. I'm Middle of the Road with Liberal and Conservative views.

""Sanctity of Marriage""

The common misconception is that Christians think all gay marriage would disturb the ""Sanctity of Marriage."" This refers to the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony that is established between a man, woman, and their god. This does NOT pertain to civil marriage, in which there was no ""sanctity"" involved in the first place. I've seen some posts about this and here is my take on trying to clean it up a little.

More importantly...

Equality of gay people in the workplace. Being denied a job for one's sexual orientation is legal in 29 states, 34 for being transgender. But around 80% of Business owners don't deny people because of their own bigotry or hatred, but because it is in the best interest of the company to make more money and attract more customers. The fault here lies in the public not widely accepting LGBT individuals enough. Society is the customer, and if they are repelled by workers because of their orientation, tattoos, piercings, etc., they will harm the business. The blame should not always be on the business owner's biases (since they do not always exist), but instead on the intolerance of their future customers in the community.

The duty now is for society as a whole to start accepting LGBTs as part of the community and show love towards them. Once society embraces them, they will be fine with ordering food from them or whatever job they may do.

This is just my idea about how to get these wheels moving and not place blame on anyone but ourselves. 

I thought about posting this to /r/politics on Saturday, so if anyone advises that, I just might do it.

Also, any criticism or points that could further my own are appreciated.

41,Theory: The Democratic Party is long-term unsustainable.,0.0,3sn7se,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3sn7se/theory_the_democratic_party_is_longterm/,40.0,1447406119.0,"I'm going to put out some of my thoughts. I don't really expect any reaction, though there's always a few who call out ""troll"" whenever a whole party is attacked. ^(Disclaimer: ^I'm ^a ^political ^independent.)

I see the Democratic party as a group of everyone who is not Republican: if you are not white, male, and/or Protestant, the likelihood of being a Democrat grows stronger. (This does not mean Democratic ideals are frivolous or spurious. I recognize this as a ""united front"" versus another ""united front,"" as per regular party mechanics.)

This leaves us with several major groups who work as bulwarks for the Democrats. These are:

Racial minorities (Black and Hispanic in particular)

Feminist

Homosexuality

Transgender

Atheism

Catholic

The Democratic Party can unite these otherwise unrelated groups for a time and lead them to vote for the left as a bloc. However, with time some schisms start to appear.

 * Blacks who [do not appreciate gay rights](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110603880.html) may begin to oppose them.
 * Feminists who [do not appreciate transgender rights](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/transgender-rights-versus-feminism-what-makes-woman-1501487) may begin to oppose them.
 * Catholics who [do not appreciate several causes](http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/3414/catholics_beginning_to_move_away_from_the_democratic_party.aspx) may begin to oppose them.
 * Religious blacks who [do not appreciate advancing atheism](http://www.pewforum.org/2009/01/30/a-religious-portrait-of-african-americans/) may begin to oppose it.

We could continue to draw further cross-lines among the various groups as they advance, but the point is made by now. The party is made up of several dynamic groups who all have objectives to obtain, and which at some points conflict with each other. The party will eventually have to either tell one group or another they can't have what they want (at which point the question is raised, why even caucus with the Democrats), or step out of the way and let the demographics fracture among themselves. In either case, the exiles will begin to form splinter parties, ruining the united Democratic front and voting bloc, handing power to the right until some other similar opposition bloc is created.

This is merely a theory, but I believe it could eventually occur, although I don't know in what time frame.

This for a military draft if needed.

Currently the Biden Administration has decided to continue to discriminate against transgender men and exclude them from this civic duty and won’t let transgender women opt out of this male privilege.

On one end of the spectrum if there was a draft transitioning genders would be a method of draft dodging and would be insulting to legitimate transitioning.  On the other end of the spectrum it is excluding trans men from a right of passage.

Other than canceling the selective service what should be changed?  Should all adults be required to register, should only cis females be exempt, should registration match gender identity, or are there other equatable solutions?

45,Why is the President expected to be a master of all political issues? Wouldn't it be a better idea to have several people who specialize in different areas rather than one person who is supposed to know everything about everything?,0.0,3ow6eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ow6eo/why_is_the_president_expected_to_be_a_master_of/,14.0,1444936449.0,"It seems weird and unrealistic to expect one person to know everything about everything and have all the answers to every question (immigration, war, diplomacy, taxes, wages, gay marriage, transgender rights, social classes, health care, national and global economy, the list goes on). These are all extremely complicated issues, many of which require years and years of research and schooling to even come close to fully understanding. Yet for some reason we expect the President to know every detail about every one of these issues *and* how to fix them all.   

Wouldn't it make more sense to employ a large host of individuals who all specialize in one or two areas? For example, one person who specializes in social issues like gay and transgender rights; one person who specializes in foreign policy like war and trade; one person who specializes in national economic issues like raising or lowering taxes, raising or lowering minimum wage, etc; one person who specializes in global economic issues; etc. Realistically all of this is far too much information for one single person to *master* (there is a difference between being familiar with something and mastering it). So why do we expect the President to have every answer to every one of these issues?  

I know that the President doesn't run the entire country alone; he has advisers and Congress plays a huge role. But during campagain seasons we grill Presidential candidates about every single issues and expect them to know all there is to know about every issue even though it's simply not realistic to do so.",PoliticalDiscussion,Transgender

However, the bill has been dogged by claims that it sets up ""special rights"" for transsexuals... and the problem is, that is true.  Specifically the [bill text](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act_of_2013_%28H.R._1755;_113th_Congress%29) on ""dress and grooming standards"" specifically exempts companies from any requirement that they offer the sexes equal rights and treatment.  Only those formally declaring a transgender identity get that protection.

This discrimination is real and significant: for example, when women are forced to follow sex-specific standards for use of cosmetics, this imposes generally uncompensated time and expense on them, not to mention trampling on their own personal notions of gender identity.  Not everybody thinks that goo is synonymous with femininity!  The right of, say, a cisgender and heterosexual male to assert his masculinity by taking pride in full beard and hair is no less important than that of a transsexual, and the law should recognize that.  We should form the resolve to burn such questions as _""Are girls allowed to do that?""_ right out of public discourse!

Indeed I see no reason not to allow some level of equality even in medical affairs.  If we acknowledge the right of a woman to take androgens to appear altogether male, then we should not criminalize the choice of a woman to take a lesser amount if she prefers merely a more muscular physique.  Of course, there are physical dangers inherent in all steroids, which must be respected; but we must ensure that policy does not impose an either-or choice on people.

I think that a firm and principled resolve on this issue would defeat the criticism of ""special rights"" and better protect us all, and I would hope it should actually have a _better_ chance to really go all the way through and become law.",PoliticalDiscussion,Transgender

The court in a brief order rejected a request made by U.S. Congressman Mike Kelly, a Trump ally, and other Pennsylvania Republicans who filed a lawsuit after the Nov. 3 election arguing that the state’s 2019 expansion of mail-in voting was illegal under state law.

At issue in the dispute is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, among other things, bars discrimination ""because of sex."" The Supreme Court has applied that prohibition in several other contexts, but Monday marks the first time it has weighed in on whether the protections extend to gay and transgender people.

The 6-3 ruling comes in a trio of cases the court considered across two hours of oral argument in October.

Thank you for your support!,10619.0,5rnn2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5rnn2c/were_here_from_the_aclu_thank_you_for_your_support/,1227.0,1486051953.0,"As you probably know by now, the ACLU [won our first victory](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/president-trumps-first-week-aclu-hands-him-first-stinging-rebuke) this week against the Trump administration. To recap: On Friday, President Trump issued an executive order banning people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. We knew what that was: The Muslim ban Trump had campaigned on disguised as a national security measure.

The executive order went into effect immediately, and the ACLU and partner organizations quickly sprang into action. Lawyers at ACLU affiliates across the country camped out at airports to offer assistance to anyone impacted by this order. Protesters showed up at airports across the country, and our communications teams went to the airports to document the protests that sprung up across the country. And early Saturday morning, we sued the Trump administration on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport. One of those clients, Hameed Khalid Darweesh arrived and was immediately detained. Darweesh worked as interpreter for the U.S. army.

Then at 9pm a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked President Trump’s discriminatory policy from going into effect.

This was the first win in a long battle. We will continue to remain vigilant protecting the civil rights and liberties of anyone impacted by Donald Trump’s policies.

Helping us remain vigilant: We have seen a massive increase in online donations, [$24 million from more than 356,000 donations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/30/the-aclu-says-it-got-24-million-in-donations-this-weekend-six-times-its-yearly-average/?utm_term=.42d2c5806a33) just over the weekend. We’re in a battle of David (us) vs. Goliath (the Trump administration and the weight of the DOJ) but we are ready.

We have a 7-point action plan for how we plan to take on the Trump administration. This includes:

#1. Demand government accountability and transparency:

   * File Freedom of Information Act requests
   * Defend whistleblowers and journalists who rely on them.

#2. Protect the rights of immigrants

   * Mount rapid response to immigration raids
   * File systemic litigation to challenge Fourth Amendment violations and racial profiling in street-level immigration enforcement
   * Develop legal theories to defend sanctuary cities against federal action
   * Represent “Dreamers” when their status comes under attack
   * Bring systemic litigation to challenge excessive and punitive immigration detention
   * Challenge unconstitutional immigration policies that discriminate against Muslims

#3. Defend reproductive rights

   * Oppose efforts to defund Planned Parenthood
   * File litigation to challenge any new federal restrictions on abortion access
   * Challenge laws that permit the use of religion to discriminate by allowing health care providers and social service agencies to turn women away when they seek reproductive health care services or information
   * Challenge abortion restrictions at the state level through litigation and advocacy
   * Challenge existing restrictions on abortion that are more vulnerable to challenge following the Supreme Court’s decision in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt

#4. Protect First Amendment rights

   * Respond aggressively to threats against Arab, Middle Eastern,            Muslim and South Asian (AMEMSA) communities
   * Expand efforts to defend and inform protestors through know-your-rights materials, provide legal observers at protests and file lawsuits to protect protestors
   * Fight dragnet government surveillance that sweeps up innocent Americans’ information

#5. Defend LGBT rights

   * Fight the rescission of federal LGBT protections
Sue the Department of Defense if it reinstates the ban on open military service by transgender people
   * Oppose religious exemption measures both in state legislatures and Congress that discriminate against LGBT individuals
   * Fight anti-transgender rights bills in Congress and in state legislatures

#6. Defend core civil rights and civil liberties from erosion

   * Identify, investigate, and challenge the worst police departments for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations
   * Intervene in federal consent decrees with police departments and private employers regarding racial and gender discrimination
   * Litigate against the worst voter suppression measures

#7. Mobilize the American people

   * Deploy our more than a million card-carrying members in direct citizen action, including protests, petitions, and lobbying
   * Raise $100 million for a Constitutional Defense Fund in support of this plan — $47 million of which has already been raised



We can answer a few questions now and will pop in throughout the day to answer more! 

We can’t do any of this without you. Thank you for your support.

AMA",2781.0,g7e7nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/g7e7nb/as_an_infectious_disease_physician_treating/,227.0,1587754454.0,"At the hospital, I join my colleagues on the frontlines of our community’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We see everyday how this crisis has compounded existing inequalities, and made it even harder for people in our district to get by.

I have spent my life serving my community. My dad was a dentist and my mother ran the office. Growing up, my sister and I joined them after school and in the summers, and their commitment to caring for each person who walked in the door inspired me to become a doctor. I married my husband, Ryan, in 2008 here in Massachusetts, fully recognizing the importance of equality for all.

I now work as a primary care doctor and an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital where I am particularly focused on those living with and at risk for HIV. This work motivated me to  push for the structural change needed to care for vulnerable populations,, and establish the hospital’s Transgender Health Program. Over the past five years, I have worked with my colleagues to build a clinical program that provides high quality, personalized care to some of the most vulnerable in our community.

Working on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic has strengthened my resolve to achieve healthcare for all. It has further solidified my belief that healthcare is about more than having an insurance card in your pocket. Healthcare is having a safe place to live. It is being paid a livable wage and being guaranteed paid sick and family leave. It is about clean water and a livable planet. It is about reliable public transportation and infrastructure. And, it is about creating national priorities that put people first.

It’s time to think bigger, and push for transformative change. That’s why I’m running for Congress.

Last year, I served as a campaign manager to Danielle Mitchell, a doctor who won the Democratic primary but lost the general election in Tennessee’s 3rd Congressional District. During that campaign, I was not vocal about my identity.

This time, in this critical US Senate race (Iowa is one of only four in the country rated as 'flippable'), I felt compelled to share my identity with the world - to me, it’s not something to be ashamed of. It’s not something to hide or try to avoid. It is a part of who I am, and it means I am well positioned to help represent a part of our country that just hasn’t been represented well before in government.  https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-activist-samantha-boucher-run-u-s-senate-campaign-n1062691    

Kimberly Graham, too, is a very special candidate. She has spent the last 20 years serving as an attorney and advocate for abused and neglected children in the Iowa courts. She's a strong progressive, and advocates for policies like universal, single-payer healthcare, universal childcare and pre-K, taking strong action to address the climate crisis, and restoring compassion to our broken immigration system and ending the manufactured border crisis.

I am proud to work for her. In fact, I quit my job in the tech sector and moved all the way to Iowa because I think Kimberly has a real chance at not only winning, but also making a huge, positive change in our nation's government. Others believe in her, too - she was recently endorsed by Brand New Congress, and stands alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Cori Bush and Paula Jean Swarengin on BNC's 2020 slate.

Unlike some of our opponents in this Democratic primary, we aren't taking tens of thousands of dollars from corporate lobbyists or writing our campaign a million dollar check. (Yes, two of our DEMOCRATIC opponents have actually done this). We're truly grassroots and progressive. You can find out more about the campaign at www.kimberlyforiowa.com

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about myself, Kimberly, or the race.

Transgender Law Center (TLC), the largest national trans-led organization advocating for a world where all people are free to define themselves and their futures, is determined to fight this memo and all of these attacks – whether the fight takes us to the courts, the ballot box, or the streets. Grounded in legal expertise and committed to racial justice, TLC does what it takes to keep transgender and gender nonconforming people alive, thriving, and fighting for liberation. Remember, trans people have been under attack since long before Trump took office – and, as elder Miss Major says, we’re #StillEffingHere.

The ones who don't would be considered to be biologically abnormal, this doesn't mean they are less valuable or less human than anyone else.

Biologically normal humans have one of two genders, while there are humans who were born with partially developed sex organs from both genders the vast majority of the population follows that norm. The ones who don't would be considered to be biologically abnormal, this doesn't mean they are less valuable or less human than anyone else.

People with Body dysmorphic disorder have a mental illness characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their dysmorphic part on their person. These people are sick, and need help because their mental illness negatively effects their health and well being.

People with Gender dysphoria have a mental illness characterized by distress they experience as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. The assigned sex and gender do not match the person's gender identity. These people are sick, and need help because their mental illness negatively effects their health and well being.

All people regardless of any biological abnormalities or mental illness are worthy of respect, dignity, and human compassion. But I find it troubling that law makers, teachers, and our culture wants to celebrate this illness and normalize something that is genetically abnormal.

I may have a flaw in my thinking, and would welcome any reasonable push back on my claims. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this subject, as someone who has known multiple transgender people and has seen them struggle in many different areas of health and well being.",Freethought,Transgender
