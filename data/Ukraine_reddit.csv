I do care about human suffering and I'm not referring to that.

What I don't give a shit about and am completely baffled by is the inexplicable, bipartisan outcry of support for Ukraine. The simple question that I feel like shouldn't have to be asked but people are so fucking stupid you have to ask is...why??? Why, out of all of the wars and unjust aggression happening by one country or people onto another, are we NOW supposed to care? The answer is obvious...yes, there are political chess moves happening and in the grand scheme of things it matters for Western power and control...but don't give us another bullshit explanation of ""defending democracy"" and ""doing the right thing"", etc., etc., when we collectively ignore the violation of human rights daily. It just pisses me off for two reasons I can think of at this moment...first, it's, to say the very least, insulting and infuriating when you think about how we willfully don't give a single fuck about countries like Palestine, Yemen, Sudan, Taiwan, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and so on and so on, but we ALL somehow now care about the suffering of Ukraine....bitch PLEASE. Where was the outrage for those countries? Where was the ""worldwide"", bipartisan union there? If you don't have the same energy for all of those conflicts as you do for Ukraine, then fuck alllll the way off. Second, it's become this cringe worthy, nationalistic social media fad to pretend to care about Ukraine the most. You don't. You don't actually give a fuck and I'm sick of seeing all of your Ukraine flag profile pictures, t-shirts, etc. because I know all you're actually waiting on is figuring out the next thing you're supposed to ""care"" about when they tell you to.",conspiracy,Ukraine

Reports indicate that Dr. Plummer was director at the NML for 7 years, including 2013 when the lab received the coronavirus from the Netherlands. 

Dr. Frank Plummer discovered dead in Kenya, Feb, 4, 2020, weeks after the outbreak.

The National Microbiology Lab is a level 4 virology laboratory that houses some of the worlds deadliest pathogens, including the ebola virus. The lab is affiliated with the University of Manitoba.

Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by Iran after departing Tehran. 63 Canadians were aboard the flight. Many were students and professors from the University of Manitoba. PhD's in microbiology.

July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were removed from the lab and the University of Manitoba, including Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Dr. Keding Cheng and students they brought from china with connections to labs in Wuhan.

The couple is under investigation in relation to an ""improper package"" that reportedly prompted a security breach.

When the shipment from Canada was uncovered, security access was revoked for Qiu, her husband, and the Chinese students. IT specialists entered Qiu’s office after hours to gain access to her computer, and her regular trips to China were halted.

>[https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/](https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/china-biological-warfare/)

Qiu reportedly made at least five trips over the academic year 2017-18 alone to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Chinese students from a notable range of Chinese scientific facilities have joined Qiu at the NML over the past decade.

Of those facilities, four are believed to be involved in Chinese biological weapons development. They are:

* Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun
* Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region
* Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei
* Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing

The Wuhan National Biosaftey Laboratory reportedly houses the Chinese Military's Virology department and presumably, the government's bioweapons program.

Lt. Col. (res.) Dr. Dany Shoham published a paper on the incident:

My only source of information is what is going on around me, what my friends in Lviv, Kyiv, and Herson tell me, as well as Telegram channels and YouTube.

I'll answer the most upvoted questions as Edits to the original post.

Here are some popular questions that I've seen in this Sub:

* Is war real?

Most definitely. The nearly constant sounds of shelling (or tank/artillery fire) outside are a clear indication of that. Aside from that my parents' apartment building roof has been obliterated. A group of people who wanted to buy some food has been massacred by a cluster bomb 20 meters from my house (google ""Pyatihatki"" and you'll be able to see the result). The war is around me DESPITE the fact that I live in a ""quiet"" part of Kharkiv.

* Why is there so little footage despite the fact that everyone has a smartphone?

Yes. Everyone has a smartphone. But unlike in movies, you have no fucking idea how scary it is to have air bombs or artillery fire at you. Even if the ""action"" is about 1 KM from your house, your whole house is shaking from the explosions, the sound is overpowering. To actually be near a window (the most dangerous place of all) and film anything is absolute Insanity. Whoever records live footage is incredibly brave and stupid to do it.

* Do Russians shell/air bomb indiscriminately?

No. They specifically target certain objects. Sometimes it’s military structures, most of the time it’s civilian structures, which is why civilian casualties are a lot greater than military casualties at this moment. In my district, Russians have specifically targeted our research institute that has no strategic significance, except the fact that it had our centralized heating station. Now we have no centralized heating while it's about -10 C at night outside.

* Why are Russians failing so miserably to capture a small country like Ukraine?

Overconfidence. They thought that they would go in guns blazing, catch everyone with their pants down and Ukraine would quickly surrender. This is why they sent many young soldiers who were in training just as a show of force. They never thought that they would have to use them to fight. But our military viciously resisted and was able to halt the Russian advance. This is the reason why the casualties among Russian soldiers are so horrific. Most of the Russian soldiers are horribly unprepared, never knew that they were going into war, and are now used as cannon fodder.

***Edit#1***

* Questions regarding Biolabs in Ukraine

As you could have guessed, a regular civilian has absolutely no knowledge of these Biolabs and what is going on within them. All I can say as a person who has a medical degree is that the Russian claims are very inconsistent and preposterous.

* What about AZOV?

Azov is a far-right military group. The best way to describe them is that they are **extremely patriotic**. However, if you were a military regiment who had to deal with Russian mercenaries in Donbas for 8 years straight, wouldn't you become extremely patriotic as well? I don't blame them.

* Your English is too good for a Ukrainian

First of all, thank you for your kind praise. Second, despite the fact that I have a medical degree I have never worked as a doctor since the salaries are ridiculously low. For the past 12 years, I have been working as a content creator and translator. I mostly write articles about app news as well as pharmaceutical articles.

* Prove that you are who you are because I don’t believe you!

Honestly, I don’t give a flying fuck whether you believe me or not. I wanted to write this article as a way to vent my frustration at the situation at hand. I know enough about psychology to understand that this post will not sway anyone’s mind.

***Edit#2***

* Для русских ребят которые это читают.

Нам говорят что вас уже начали призывать и выдывать повестки. Не идите. Сломайте себе руку у местного хирурга и откосите. Рука отлично заживет месяца за два зато живы будете. У нас тут правда никаких нациков нема. Протесты всякие это всё хуйня, не поможет это. Но не идите сюда, не умирайте за Путина. Добра вам.

***FinalEdit***

* But what about the symbols that AZOV uses?

Guys. Do you realize that we are being invaded here with a real chance of **death** or destruction of property? Invaded because we are Ukrainians; because we are **""an imaginary nation that shouldn't exist""**. Do you fucking understand that?! Who the fuck would care what symbols they use??

No that's just the oppression you're seeing on the big screen now because the whole fucking media is blasting the Ukraine/Russia situation to you bottom feeders 24/7.

b-b-b-but the vaccine mandates are being removed on March 1st anyway! /s

And even if they remove SOME OF THEM on the provincial level does that mean we just ROLL OVER and let our Prime minister keep up the travel bans? As I already stressed, we have LITERAL travel bans on our own citizens, yeah kind of sounds like fucking TYRANNY doesn't it?

The point is, you should stop shaming us just because ""rEaL tYrAnNy"" is happening on the other side of the world. Where were you fucks when Obama bombed the living hell out of Afghanistan? Where were you fucks when Trudeau painted his face BLACK and stuck his tongue out with a banana in his hand singing ""DAYOOO"" (or honestly during any of his other million scandals).

But most importantly, where the FUCK were you when the Canadian government decided it would be a good idea to ban your fellow citizens from travelling across our great country, or when Canadian universities & colleges banned and de-enrolled their unvaccinated students on a split second decision (who PAID for their educations and got ROBBED).

Where were you all this time? You don't have to stare at your computer screens and seethe about Russia/Ukraine to feel like you're united against tyranny when it's already in the atmosphere around you.

Here is the proof that the DKIM in the email was signed by gmail's public domain key: https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/hunter-dkim/blob/main/verify.py

What does this mean? 

It means an email of exactly the text above (it cannot be altered) was sent by Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden on Friday the 17th of April , 2015.

We need to get the other emails on that laptop so we can verify their validity, but this one was real.

It appears that Hunter introduced Joe to energy executives in the Ukraine while being paid by these executives when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States. 

That's called pay-for-play. It's corrupt.

**1) For the lying shills claiming the sending email isn't really from a Burisma advisor, well, yes it is (see the link).** Do you really think Pozharskyi is going to commit fraud with his work email account? Here is the link: https://blog.intelx.io/2020/10/14/an-osint-investigation-into-the-alleged-hunter-biden-email/

The TLDR: 
>Therefore, it is accurate to historically associate Vadym Pozharskyi as a member of Burisma Holdings with the email address, v.pozharskyi.ukraine...

**2) For the other lying shills claiming DKIM doesn't verify the content of the email, shocker... you are LYING.  YES IT DOES.**

Here are the fields verified by DKIM, **which include the body of the email.**

Let’s take this piece by piece to see what it means. Each “tag” is associated with a value.

* b = the actual digital signature of the contents (headers and body) of the mail message
* bh = the body hash
* d = the signing domain
* s = the selector
* v = the version
* a = the signing algorithm
* c = the canonicalization algorithm(s) for header and body
* q = the default query method
* l = the length of the canonicalized part of the body that has been signed
* t = the signature timestamp
* x = the expire time
* h = the list of signed header fields, repeated for fields that occur multiple times

The sender is Pozharskyi. The receiver is Hunter at his shady hedge fund. The text of the message is exactly what was written above or the bh tag (a hash of the body of the email) would change and break the verification. The DKIM signature timestamp was 4/17/15. That can't be spoofed.

Tiktok is known for affecting mental health and children's attention spans.

Its also been shown that Tiktok causes short attention spans due to its high energy, short, looping format.

This is what China wants. It's no secret that China wants to control the world. This war with Ukraine is egged on by China, they are preying the Russian economy collapses d

25,Almost $100 Billion Has Been Officially Sent To Ukraine Which Is Around The Amount Of Money Required To End All Poverty In America,2378.0,x1mt2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x1mt2b/almost_100_billion_has_been_officially_sent_to/,415.0,1661875201.0,"The senile adult diaper soiling ice cream eating pedo criminal puppet and his illegitimate administration waging a full spectrum soft war on We the People on behalf of their One World Government handlers has to date gifted nearly $100 billion to the illegitimate CIA-run Ukrainian government.

The official number is staggering, but the shadow books sum is far larger. These funds are primarily being used as CIA black ops money laundering and kickbacks to D.C. politicians and various assets and entities.

Congress is the only government entity that may vote for war. It has not voted for a single war since WW2. Thus, all of the wars since Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and every other war America has been engaged in have all been illegal.

America is currently illegally engaged in a proxy war with Russia. This too is illegal.

Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for even a cent of money to be sent to foreign nations for their wars. This is theft.

The illegitimate Federal government operating out of the foreign nation of Washington, D.C. is illegally stealing the fruits of We the People’s labors via their fraudulent agency known as the IRS. The government does not need this money. No matter what percent of taxes is stolen, the government is equally as insolvent and spending at a similar rate.

Taxation is nothing more than [social engineering](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/original-social-engineering-sin) to control and ultimately prematurely murder Americans.

For some perspective on the more recent crime sprees of this fraudulent and sociopathic “government”:

* $100 billion dollars distributed to poor Americans would more or less eradicate poverty\*
* $100 billion dollars distributed to homeless Americans would more or less eradicate homelessness\*
* the $80 billion recently allocated to the unconstitutional IRS and their new army of armed goons that have no [legal powers](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/memorandum-of-law-the-legality-of) to steal direct un-apportioned monies via “taxes” (i.e. “income” taxes) from Americans would eradicate most if not all poverty and/or homelessness in America\*.

Let that sink in: $80 billion stolen from you to fund more theft from you that simultaneously steals away productive GDP and as such decimates the main economic driving forces. The middle class and poor will become poorer thanks to the money that was stolen from them in the first place. Talk about a viciously depraved and wholly unconstitutional feedback loop.

But alas, this latest IRS scam serves to reinforce the WEF and UN Great Reset agenda perfectly, because this illegitimate government is only beholden to the One World Government which necessitates the destruction of the American populace it pretends to serve. The $100 billion in Ukrainian “war” money is just their fuck you money slush fund that is also being used indirectly and directly against We the People.

The only way to survive this criminally out of control government is to offer total nonviolent noncompliance in every facet of our lives. This must be done en masse, and done now.

Do NOT comply.

>Psychosis is when people lose some contact with reality. Mass formation psychosis is when a large part of a society focuses its attention to a leader(s) or a series of events and their attention focuses on one small point or issue. Followers can be hypnotized and be led anywhere, regardless of data proving otherwise. A key aspect of the phenomena is that the people they identify as the leaders – the one’s that can solve the problem or issue alone – they will follow that leader(s) regardless of any new information or data. Furthermore, anybody who questions the leader’s narrative are attacked and disregarded.

>There are four key components needed for an environment to experience a mass formation psychosis: lack of social bonds or decoupling of societal connections, lack of sense-making (things don’t make sense), free-floating anxiety, and free-floating psychological discontent. Free-floating anxiety is a general sense of uneasiness that is not tied to any particular object or specific situation.

>When followers start to participate in a strategy to deal with the object of anxiety, new social bonds typically emerge and people change from a highly aversive negative mental state and isolation, to the exact opposite to the extremely high-level of connectedness that exists.

American media is in complete meltdown and panic mode and yet here few people seem concerned at all.

The American media makes it sound like Mordor is knocking at our door, and all they have to do is step over the threshold and the country is in ruins. 

In reality, life continues the way it always has. No one is building bunkers in the city, grocery store shelves are as full as they’ve ever been, there are no emergency preparedness billboards or commercials anywhere.

The other part of me thinks that this panic is to distract America from bad times. I don’t know. But whatever is actually happening, the news in America about Ukraine does not at all match up with the reality I’m experiencing.

1. The FDA on Tuesday released a large tranche of Pfizer clinical trials documents in response to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request by the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency. The documents show that the company knew people were at risk of experiencing more than 1,000 unique adverse side-effects to the mRNA injections.

2. Additionally, scientists last week revealed that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine can enter human liver cells and be converted into DNA—something the fact-checkers and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control assured the public could never happen. 

3. Scientists also recently discovered that a sequence of genetic material patented by Moderna in 2018 bears a suspicious similarity to the spike protein in Sars-Cov2.

4. A new study published on March 2 found that the synthetic mRNA found in the vaccines does not degrade quickly as promised, but continues to produce spike proteins for nearly two weeks.


5. The virus continues to rage through highly vaccinated countries, afflicting the triple-vaxxed most of all.

Then Zelensky getting on the Grammy awards for a propaganda speech to the American public? Unbelievable! Daresay, unprofessional! I can't think of any time in recent history where a foreign head of state was given a public platform at an award event. I wonder who greenlit THAT.

The net result is that i don't care anymore. We have a war going on that is bankrolled by the very countries that are sending money, weapons and sanctions to oppose Russia.

I told her not listen to the news and do not go along with the government mandate narrative.

I used any analogy that I could to convince her the vaccines are not because of Covid, but Covid is because of the vaccines. End if the day, she got vaccinated. She caved because of her doctors, news, media posts and her wired co-workers.

Yesterday she called me and absolutely snapped. I've never heard her like this. All imaginary and creative language was used to discredit the whole ""plandemic"" that was orchestrated. She's acknowledged she's been lied to for 2 years, division within the public, losing 2 years of her life with lockdowns, non-stop masks, global media narrative etc etc. 

So what did it take for her to finally smell the bullshit? No, it wasn't the fact that vaccines don't stop the spread, or that more people die from vaccination that Covid, or that the case numbers have been falsely inflated by hospitals, or that the elite are trying to tattoo QR codes on our forehead and treat us like cattle with a microchip...

It was the fact that she called her close relatives in Russia to ask them about the whole Russia taking over Ukraine news she just saw. Her relatives said that there is absolutely no tension between Russia and Ukraine and that most likely the North American coverage on the topic is false to discredit Russian and Putin.

The veil has been lifted which quickly escalated to a series of ""connecting the dots"" between all pandemic topics. A uphoric waterfall slept her off her feet and gave her vision of the bullshit that she has been lead to believe.

Ukraine is not going to beat Russia in a war. 
How naive can ppl be? 

That $40B was a transfer of wealth from the American taxpayer to the military industrial complex and every single Democrat that voted on the bill voted to pass it. 

Hey Lefty warhawks…what’s a war’s carbon footprint? 

Gas is close to $5/ gal., inflation is at record highs, our border has never been in worse shape, there’s a baby formula shortage, and food shortages are incoming but let’s send 3x more than the entire music industry in America makes ($12B) in a year to Ukraine.  

$40B is a shit ton of money. How bout picking 40 mid-sized cities and sending them each a billion for infrastructure upgrades? 

And just like us, the Ukrainian people aren’t going to see a dime of that money but they’re far less important than showing support for the latest thing anyway. 

Any politician who truly cared about the Ukrainian ppl would be urging the Biden regime to let Zelensky negotiate peace with Putin, not enable the killing of more Ukrainians by prolonging a war they can’t win.

The narrative that I was lead to believe was incredibly far from the whole truth.. Only sharing for anyone else like me who was believing a wildly inaccurate narrative.. Some of this was just for context, but a lot of it are things I've only recently learned.

Sorry if its a bit scattered, there was a lot of things I didn't know. Maybe everyone else already knows all the details, if so, I apologize for wasting your time.

It turns out, they're all crooks.

Burisma is a Ukrainian natural gas company that was founded and ran by a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, who was basically the poster-child for corruption.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky

The SFO investigator Richard Gould claimed in the April 2014 court hearing that Zlochevsky’s dual position in Ukraine as both a politician and a businessman gave “rise to a clear - wilful and dishonest exploitation of a direct conflict of interest by a man holding an important public office - to an abuse of the public’s trust in him”.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/the-money-machine-how-a-high-profile-corruption-investigation-fell-apart

“May 13, 2014: Burisma Group announced that Hunter Biden [and Devon Archer] would be joining its board. Around that time, Burisma’s founder, a former government official named Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for alleged money laundering by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-timeline-idUSKBN1W82HK

Zlochevsky is still suspected of bribery and other crimes by several different countries. (His whereabouts are currently unknown.)

https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senate-probe-finds-john-kerry-falsely-claimed-he-had-no-knowledge-of-hunter-bidens-role-in-burisma/


Viktor Shokin was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in 2015-2016. He was leading an investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shokin

According to him, ""On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of [Burisma], but I refused to close this investigation.”

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/documents-heighten-scrutiny-on-biden-ukraine-dealings-indicate-hunter-may-have-made-millions


So Burisma.. The same company that sent Hunter Biden $83k every month to do nothing?

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf

“Hunter Biden sat on the Burisma board from April 2014 (while the company was already under investigation) until April 2019.”

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/13/20912336/hunter-biden-resigns-chinese-firm-impeachment-inquiry-joe-trump


So we know Hunter Biden was on the Board of Directors at Burisma while they were being investigated by Viktor Shokin.. Well here’s where it got interesting to me..

Testimony from sworn affidavit of former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin:

“6. ...[President] Poroshenko asked me to resign due to pressure from the US Presidential administration, in particular from Joe Biden, who was the US Vice-President. Biden was threatening to withhold USD$ 1 billion in subsidies to Ukraine until I was removed from office…""

“7. The official reason put forward for my dismissal was that I had allegedly failed to secure the public's trust. Poroshenko and other state officials, including representatives of the US presidential administration, had never previously had any complaints about my work, however. There were no grievances against me or any allegations that had I committed any corruption-related (or, indeed any other) criminal offenses. Biden never stated anything of the kind either…”

“8. The Truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings (""Burisma""), a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors. I assume Burisma...had the support of the US Vice-President Joe Biden because his son was on the Board of Directors.”

“9. On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company, but I refused to close this investigation. Therefore, I was forced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration. In my conversations with Poroshenko at the time, he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma. When I did not, he said that the US (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice, therefore, but to ask me to resign.”

- December 8, 2019, former Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by a reporter whether he knew of Hunter Biden’s activities during his tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry told the reporter regarding Biden’s position on the Burisma board. “What would I know about any—no. Why would I know about any company or any individual? No.”

However, Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee that he informed Kerry personally of Biden’s role at Burisma. Wade received an email on May 13, 2014, from Kerry’s stepson, Chris Heinz, telling him that Hunter Biden and associate Devon Archer had joined Burisma.

""According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Bohai is China's oldest private equity firm, having launched the country's first yuan-denominated fund in 2006....Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm founded by Michael Lin and James Bulger, son of former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger.[3] Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm, founded by Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Hunter Biden""

“The firm InfoUSA, headed by major Clinton backer Vinod Gupta, has placed Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi Jr., on its payroll – even though he has no experience in the company's main business activities, NewsMax has learned.”

“Just four weeks after Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House this past January, Gupta and InfoUSA hired her son as a senior vice president. He told NewsMax InfoUsa pays him $180,000 a year.

Even though his job with InfoUSA is considered full-time, Paul Pelosi continues another full-time job, as a home loan officer at Countrywide Home Loans, part of Countrywide Financial, in San Mateo, a suburb of San Francisco.”

At the expense of bloodshed, they can manipulate the psychology and opinions of everyone on the globe. The media is force feeding pro-Ukraine pro-NWO propaganda down people’s throats. They’re so blinded by initial, irrational emotional reactions from seeing shellings and death, that they can’t foresee the actual implications of this unification under a globalist scale.

All wars are about money and power. Transactions are being made every second and people are getting rich as we speak, donations to Ukraine will be used to proliferate war crimes, and to line the pockets of the elite. Countries that aren’t a part of NATO will be incentivized to join through fear from the staged war. Once they do they will be taxed into oblivion, and once again that money will be used to fuel this agenda and to line the pockets of the elite. Sanctions will be used as a guise to hike prices, again so the rich can profit.

Once the good guys save us all from the bad guys, they will require more trust from us. They will require more control. A one world government will be instated, as well as a one world bank. Your actions will be monitored through social credit systems, to make sure you aren’t a bad guy, so that they can keep protecting you. This is all a theatre, and before our eyes we see people blindly choosing sides, and believing everything that they see or hear.

People are very sensitive to shock value, and it makes them herd into the desired direction that the propaganda tells them to head towards. In this case, this staged war and propaganda is leading us to the full-on acceptance of the NWO, and brainwashed individuals will stand by it tooth and nail that it is a welcomed control.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

EDIT: (please read to avoid misunderstandings)

1.) When I say staged I don’t mean faked, there is a distinction to be made here. Obviously there are people dying, and the fighting is real. What I meant is that the conditions for the war were set up intentionally by all parties involved. It is mostly out of the civilians control. 

2.) I am not right-wing nor am I attempting to spread Qanon, this is not related. I am not a Russian apologist or shill. I condemn the war in every manner. I simply believe it was set up by elites and has a much deeper agenda, rather than it simply being because Putin wants oil or land buffers.

3.) I am not attempting to move goalposts or make specific timeline predictions. The great reset began in 2020, and I suggest looking up the great reset agenda on the world economic forums website, as it confirms some of my stances.

Putin is a tyrant and a dictator, but he is also a globalist puppet playing out a script that was written long ago. Absolutely hate this dude but understand my hatred is what *they* want. Fuck Putin.

2. The [Ukrainian president](https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/special-address-by-volodymyr-zelenskyy-president-of-ukraine?fbclid=IwAR3ydsgyWlzw7tkx5KRGN3rbSEXnvkNE6XOXC9s7Zc3_TMhwlbsHFXyQA-Q) is an absolute joke, a literal sketch comedy actor with [extremely shady history](https://www.dcreport.org/2019/10/03/now-you-know-how-really-weird-this-whole-ukraine-thing-is/). All the praise he's getting all over Reddit should clue you in on what's going on. Propaganda is working quite efficiently. He is leading innocent Ukrainians to their death while he will come out unscathed. Also a globalist puppet playing his part. Fuck Zelensky. 

3. Yes geopolitics are incredibly complicated and I'm not saying things are as simple as the first two points, but in a theater performance, all of the production that happens behind the scenes is equally complicated and coordinated. 

4. I love my country. I grew up in western Ukraine. Ukrainians are incredibly nationalistic, patriotic and brave, and hate Russia with a passion because of historical atrocities. I can't help but feel that this hatred is being channeled for Ukrainian men and women to give their life defending Ukrainian glory in an absolutely needless conflict. 

5. Klitschko brothers in Ukraine, Tulsi in US, all these other various minor characters are also puppets with clear links to WEF. It pains me to say this because Klitschko brothers were my idols growing up, and I really supported Tulsi during the last election. Fucking WEF snakes - they're literally everywhere. Perhaps it's an over-reaction on my part, but at this point, anyone who shook hands with Schwab and was part of his programmes is guilty until proven innocent.

6. During COVID pandemic, republicans were more measured with lockdowns and mandates. Democrats turned into demons. Now, Republicans are ""supporting"" Putin and Democrats are seemingly doing the right thing by supporting Ukraine. These flip flops (I personally view them as such, you may disagree) on important issues are meant to subvert the political orientation of many Americans and confuse them. The two party system in the US and in many other countries is by design meant to confuse and blind, but I digress.

7. It pains me to see what is slowly becoming a real tragedy. I have relatives back in Ukraine who are in very uncertain place, mentally, emotionally, and in terms of pure physical survival. With that said, I find it incredibly difficult to get invested in these events because I know this is all, at the end of the day, a sick globalist game being played out to usher in their NWO dystopia. It does pain me to see people suffer. I want to and will help as much as I can, but I refuse to be mentally invested in this conflict just as I refused to be living in a constant state of fear with the scamdemic we just got through. 

8. Come what may, don't lose your humanity. Help those you can in your circle of influence and don't get too invested in this sick theatrical game that Klaus Schwab and his den of soulless parasites are carrying out.

EDIT: some are claiming this post is propaganda. If I was in your shoes I would be skeptical too. There is a lot of fuckery going on all over social media. You can go through my submission history, I've talked about being Ukrainian in the past, albeit not much since I do not like giving out any personal details on reddit. My username *konval* is taken from *konvalia* which is Ukrainian for *lily of the valley*, a flower I used to love picking in early spring with my grandmother. While I *am* Ukrainian, I do not currently live in Ukraine. I have lived in the US for more than half of my life. I love both countries, consider both *my* country despite rampant and increasing corruption in each. 

I want Ukraine to retain its sovereignty and I want Putin's botox clown face to fucking melt already. I'm not mincing my words - fuck soviet union and fuck Putin for trying to recreate it. With that said, I have suspicions to believe that the Ukrainian president wants Ukraine to fall. My intuition tells me, despite his theatrics, he couldn't care less about Ukraine or its poor people. There is no clean way to resolve this situation, and I believe it will only get worse, which is why I'm taking my emotions out of this political and wartime theater and focusing on how I can help poor people stuck in this terrible situation.

One last thing, [this statement](https://www.activistpost.com/2022/02/order-out-of-chaos-how-the-ukraine-conflict-is-designed-to-benefit-globalists.html) is spot on:

*""The Ukraine scenario could be easily defused if both sides took some basic diplomatic measures, but this is not going to happen. NATO officials could take a step back from their pursuit of adding Ukraine to the ranks. The US could stop pouring cash and weaponry into Ukraine to the tune of $5.4 billion since 2014. Over 90 tons of military equipment have been sent to the country in 2022 alone. Russia could stop sending covert special operations units into the Donbass and be more willing to come to the table to discuss diplomatic solutions. The reason these things do not happen is because they are not allowed to happen by the power brokers behind the curtain.""*",conspiracy,Ukraine

Joe Biden announced to send another $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine while many Americans struggle with record-high gas and groceries prices, baby formula and food shortages, 401Ks crashing due to market collapse, highest inflation, and highest interest rates since 1994.

Joe Biden announced on Wednesday after a phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he will send additional aid for security and humanitarian assistance. “I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas,” Biden said in a statement. “Today, I am also announcing an additional $225 million in humanitarian assistance to help people inside Ukraine, including by supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items,” Biden added.

Secretary Antony Blinken announced on his Twitter account that he would spend the $350 million for additional U.S. arms, equipment & supplies for Ukraine as part of the $1 billion assistance. ""As authorized by @POTUS, I am directing the drawdown of $350 million in additional U.S. arms, equipment & supplies for Ukraine—part of $1 billion in U.S. support announced today to reinforce Ukraine’s defenses against Russia’s senseless war of choice. ""    — Secretary Antony Blinken, June 15, 2022

“Speaking in Brussels, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. and Ukraine were working in lockstep to meet Ukraine’s requests for new capabilities, especially its need for long-range fires, armor and coastal defense,” CNN reported. “This package also includes $650 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds and that will help Ukraine defends itself with two additional Harpoon coastal defense systems and thousands of secure radios, night vision devices, thermal sites, and other optics,” Austin announced. U.S. President on Wednesday announced a fresh U.S. infusion of $1 billion in weapons for #Ukraine that includes anti-ship rocket systems, artillery rockets, howitzers, and ammunition.

The U.S. also plans to send another $225 million in humanitarian aid, Biden said.  “The Biden administration has previously provided Ukraine with over $5.3 billion in military assistance, of which $4.6 billion has come since February 24, according to Kahl. The $1 billion announced Wednesday is on top of these numbers,” R.T. reported.  Biden’s announcement comes after his rant about reckless spending on Tuesday. Joe Biden began screaming out of nowhere and scolded critics for claiming his reckless spending caused inflation rates to spike. “I don’t wanna hear any more of these lies about reckless spending!” Biden shouted.

Joe Biden spoke at the AFL-CIO labor union convention in Philadelphia where he defended his abysmal economic track record and lashed out at Wall Street. Biden repeated the same boring lies in his speech to 2,000 union members and state officials: “We’ve made extraordinary progress and put America in a position to tackle the worldwide problem that is worse everywhere but here, inflation!” Biden said.",conspiracy,Ukraine

160,An open letter to the whoever gives a damn. We are on the doorsteps of global communism. The new world order is upon us.,756.0,powq3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/powq3b/an_open_letter_to_the_whoever_gives_a_damn_we_are/,216.0,1631732978.0,"This is the only place where I can post this without censorship and, hopefully, ridicule. What follows is a summary of my reflection on current events. 

When I was about 5 or 6 years old living in a small rural town in western Ukraine I used to love visiting my grandparents, as any child would. The bond between a young child full of wonder and curiosity who is at the start of their adventure, and grandparents weathered by experience and life lessons who are at the end of theirs, is a very special one. While my grandparents had a few toys that I liked to play with, it was their company that I always looked forward to when visiting. Specifically, I used to love having them tell me stories and read books. Their book collection, from what I can remember, was modest, and didn't really have much in a way of children's books. One such book from their collection always drew my attention. It was an intimidating, large book with a black front and back cover. I wasn't encouraged to look at it, but at the same time I wasn't forbidden either, so with as much curiosity as a child can have, one day the little old me looked inside. It was a picture book, but not one filled with age-appropriate children's characters and fantasy stories; no - this one was a photo documentation of Holodomor. 

Holodomor was a forced starvation of Ukrainians by Stalinistic Communism in 1930s. Ukraine was considered a ""breadbasket"" of Europe because of its rich and fertile fields of wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, and many other foods. The ravenous and growing Soviet force wanted all of the resources possible for their expanding socialist empire, so they raided Ukrainian farms and took all of the wheat, all of the produce, all of the livestock. Any kind of nourishment was confiscated. For a system that is all about redistribution, there wasn't any of it going on to the poor Ukrainians. If you were found hiding something in the nooks and crannies of your house, you were likely executed. Movement was restricted, so if you wanted to flee and alert others, you couldn't. Such was the flavor of life in vast parts of the country. This man-made famine was needed sacrifice for the ""greater good"". Stalin's quote ""the death of one is a tragedy; death of many is a statistic"" comes to mind.

The book was filled with black and white photos of piles of dead bodies rotting in the fields and city streets, and famished children on the verge of death with swollen bellies and protruding rib cages. It chronicled - in very graphic and visceral detail - the real effects of communism. Some speculate that the famine was planned by Stalin to crush Ukrianian resistance and prevent an independence movement that would have otherwise threatened the expansion of Soviet Union. Hard to tell what the devil was planning, but sounds very plausible. About as many as 10 million innocent lives were lost - if not more - during this dark period in history. Exact numbers and facts are, again, largely unknown because ""fact checking"" and record keeping was as reliable under communism back then as it is here and today. Censorship is a very powerful tool in the hands of tyrants. 

I was probably too young to be exposed to this kind of material, but in a way I am glad I was, because it permanently ingrained in me an understanding of the reality of this world and the unbelievable horrors that can plague it. I was too young to realize at the time, but I've come to learn just how fragile and ephemeral everything that makes this existence worth enduring can be. I learned about what gives rise to the brutality of Soviet communism and German nazism. These tyrannical and totalitarian regimes and their unimaginable crimes against humanity always sneak through in the dead of night and gain foothold under the guise of ""greater good"" and other abstract and vaguely defined ideals that always come in conflict with individual need. 

While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives. This abstract ideal has most recently morphed into ""public health"" and those in power want us - need us - to sacrifice whatever they deem necessary for this ambiguous ideal.

The most important lesson that the Holodomor book and subsequent history-learning taught me was this: the evil that has gripped human civilization since the dawn of time and that manifested in Soviet Union doesn't magically disappear. We didn't defeat it when World War 2 ended or when the Soviet Union broke up. It didn't vanish when Hitler or Stalin or Pol Pot finally bit the dust. It certainly didn't end when we used 9/11 as a pretext to look for weapons of mass destruction, spread freedom and democracy, and destroy & destabilize the entire Arab world. No; this evil largely went out of sight and out of mind in order to regroup and recalibrate, and it is now re-emerging in full strength, ready - this time - to devour the entire world. 

Now, several decades later and as a proud American, I can say with as much certainty as I will ever have in this life that we are standing on the doorsteps of global Communism. The same kind of ""greater good"" mode of government that gave us Holodomor, Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, and Cultural Revolution in China. Everyone who is supporting this descent into the mouth of madness by cheering as liberty and freedom are being traded away for the illusion of safety is spitting in the face of the forefathers who sacrificed everything for you to be free. You are tearing apart what this country and its incredible constitution represent. You are enthusiastically enabling the slippery slope to global communist dictatorship the likes of which the world has never seen. Ironically, many of you ""liberals"" appear to know absolutely nothing about liberty. In fact, your ignorance and self-righteousness is leading us all in a very dark direction and one that is *opposite* of liberty. I know that this sounds hyperbolic and a little extreme, but if you pull away from the mind-rotting entertainment and ceaseless mental conditioning of the mainstream media, and if you study the past and understand the incremental patterns that evil takes in order to take root and grow, then you would understand the realness and urgency of what I am saying. 

I wish you all well.",conspiracy,Ukraine

It was totally FINE to be one and identify as one.

## Network overview

Of the 35 accounts found so far 6 are currently active, 11 are suspended, and 4 are shadow banned. The remaining 14 are inactive but still appear usable.

Most of the accounts were created in batches in 2021 and sat idle for several months to a year. A couple of them appear to have been previously used for spam and some of the accounts tried to earn karma by reposting old misspelled comments.

Here is a plot showing the full timeline for these accounts:

[Full timeline](https://preview.redd.it/dlanr6wh78n91.png?width=4040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45aff348dd8cdaf868250efc61e3ef768af698b7)

&#x200B;

Each row represents one account. The horizontal axis represents time. Black stars are when the account was created and the dots are days when the account made a post or comment.

Accounts with activity before 2022-03-24 were either being used for spam, or they were farming karma with misspelled comment reposts.

# Subgroups

This network can be split into 3 groups based on the dates they are active and their interactions with each other.

In each group, there is 1 or 2 accounts that make the bulk of their submissions while the other accounts leave comments on those posts and engage with other Reddit users.

The first group operated from the end of March through Mid June and included at least 13 accounts.

Here is a plot of their activity. The vertical axis represents time, each column represents one account, and each dot is when that account made a submission or comment.

[Group one timeline](https://preview.redd.it/99vcuor088n91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a096d956c42240d4aecb192bf93dfef4a98e027a)

You can clearly see the accounts going active and inactive at the same dates and times. This is when they were leaving comments on posts from one of the other accounts.

Here is a graph showing their interactions with each other. Each node is an account. Pink nodes are accounts that made submissions. Arrows show an account making a comment on a submission by one of the other accounts.

## Content overview

These accounts have made 119 submissions with a combined score of 95,000. They also made a total of 407 comments with a combined score of 4,700

The majority of their submissions hit the front page of the subreddit with several taking the top spot for a day. There were a total of 25,000 comment replies left on their submissions from other Reddit users.

Most of their posts (76) are images hosted on `i.redd.it`. The next most common are self-posts (27).

The vast majority of their posts are anti-Ukraine in some way with the most recent groups focusing on discouraging US military aid. At least 8 of the accounts also participated in a thread in r-AskARussian on April 18

The posts that do not have to do with Ukraine are either reposts from popular old Reddit threads, or copied from other platforms. When they copy comments from other users, they change them (sometimes significantly) to try to avoid detection.

There are people monitoring and controlling the accounts directly and they reply to both users and moderators with original content. 

## Working hours

Most of the accounts are active between 2am and 9am US EST. Only one account was active after 3pm and their activity ranges from 2am to 5pm.

Several of the posts made by these accounts are screenshots of posts from Twitter showing their local time. Based on this and the times the Tweets were made, these accounts are operating in time zone UTC +8.

PUTIN (THROUGH INTERPRETER): Your excellency Mr. President, your excellency Mr. Secretary General, distinguished heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, the 70th anniversary of the United Nations is a good occasion to both take stock of history and talk about our common future.

In 1945, the countries that defeated Nazism joined their efforts to lay solid foundations for the postwar world order.

But I remind you that the key decisions on the principles guiding the cooperation among states, as well as on the establishment of the United Nations, were made in our country, in Yalta, at the meeting of the anti-Hitler coalition leaders.

The Yalta system was actually born in travail. It was won at the cost of tens of millions of lives and two world wars.

This swept through the planet in the 20th century.

Let us be fair. It helped humanity through turbulent, at times dramatic, events of the last seven decades. It saved the world from large-scale upheavals.

The United Nations is unique in its legitimacy, representation and universality. It is true that lately the U.N. has been widely criticized for supposedly not being efficient enough, and for the fact that the decision-making on fundamental issues stalls due to insurmountable differences, first of all, among the members of the Security Council.

However, I’d like to point out there have always been differences in the U.N. throughout all these 70 years of existence. The veto right has always been exercised by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, the Soviet Union and Russia later, alike. It is absolutely natural for so diverse and representative an organization.

When the U.N. was established, its founders did not in the least think that there would always be unanimity. The mission of the organization is to seek and reach compromises, and its strength comes from taking different views and opinions into consideration. Decisions debated within the U.N. are either taken as resolutions or not. As diplomats say, they either pass or do not pass.

Whatever actions any state might take bypassing this procedure are illegitimate. They run counter to the charter and defy international law. We all know that after the end of the Cold War — everyone is aware of that — a single center of domination emerged in the world, and then those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were tempted to think that if they were strong and exceptional, they knew better and they did not have to reckon with the U.N., which, instead of [acting to] automatically authorize and legitimize the necessary decisions, often creates obstacles or, in other words, stands in the way.

It has now become commonplace to see that in its original form, it has become obsolete and completed its historical mission. Of course, the world is changing and the U.N. must be consistent with this natural transformation. Russia stands ready to work together with its partners on the basis of full consensus, but we consider the attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations as extremely dangerous. They could lead to a collapse of the entire architecture of international organizations, and then indeed there would be no other rules left but the rule of force.

We would get a world dominated by selfishness rather than collective work, a world increasingly characterized by dictate rather than equality. There would be less of a chain of democracy and freedom, and that would be a world where true independent states would be replaced by an ever-growing number of de facto protectorates and externally controlled territories.

What is the state sovereignty, after all, that has been mentioned by our colleagues here? It is basically about freedom and the right to choose freely one’s own future for every person, nation and state. By the way, dear colleagues, the same holds true of the question of the so-called legitimacy of state authority. One should not play with or manipulate words.

Every term in international law and international affairs should be clear, transparent and have uniformly understood criteria. We are all different, and we should respect that. No one has to conform to a single development model that someone has once and for all recognized as the only right one. We should all remember what our past has taught us.

We also remember certain episodes from the history of the Soviet Union. Social experiments for export, attempts to push for changes within other countries based on ideological preferences, often led to tragic consequences and to degradation rather than progress.

It seemed, however, that far from learning from others’ mistakes, everyone just keeps repeating them, and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.

But how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.

I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what you’ve done? But I am afraid no one is going to answer that. Indeed, policies based on self-conceit and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.

It is now obvious that the power vacuum created in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa through the emergence of anarchy areas, which immediately started to be filled with extremists and terrorists.

Tens of thousands of militants are fighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic State. Its ranks include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Many recruits also come from Libya, a country whose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. And now, the ranks of radicals are being joined by the members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition supported by the Western countries.
First, they are armed and trained and then they defect to the so-called Islamic State. Besides, the Islamic State itself did not just come from nowhere. It was also initially forged as a tool against undesirable secular regimes.

Having established a foothold in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State has begun actively expanding to other regions. It is seeking dominance in the Islamic world. And not only there, and its plans go further than that. The situation is more than dangerous.

In these circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels of financing and supporting terrorists, including the process of trafficking and illicit trade in oil and arms. It would be equally irresponsible to try to manipulate extremist groups and place them at one’s service in order to achieve one’s own political goals in the hope of later dealing with them or, in other words, liquidating them.

To those who do so, I would like to say — dear sirs, no doubt you are dealing with rough and cruel people, but they’re in no way primitive or silly. They are just as clever as you are, and you never know who is manipulating whom. And the recent data on arms transferred to this most moderate opposition is the best proof of it.

We believe that any attempts to play games with terrorists, let alone to arm them, are not just short-sighted, but fire hazardous (ph). This may result in the global terrorist threat increasing dramatically and engulfing new regions, especially given that Islamic State camps train militants from many countries, including the European countries.

Unfortunately, dear colleagues, I have to put it frankly: Russia is not an exception. We cannot allow these criminals who already tasted blood to return back home and continue their evil doings. No one wants this to happen, does he?

Russia has always been consistently fighting against terrorism in all its forms. Today, we provide military and technical assistance both to Iraq and Syria and many other countries of the region who are fighting terrorist groups.
We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces, who are valiantly fighting terrorism face to face. We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad’s armed forces and Kurds (ph) militias are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.

We know about all the problems and contradictions in the region, but which were (ph) based on the reality.

Dear colleagues, I must note that such an honest and frank approach of Russia has been recently used as a pretext to accuse it of its growing ambitions, as if those who say it have no ambitions at all.

However, it’s not about Russia’s ambitions, dear colleagues, but about the recognition of the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world. What we actually propose is to be guided by common values and common interests, rather than ambitions.

On the basis of international law, we must join efforts to address the problems that all of us are facing and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism.

Similar to the anti-Hitler coalition, it could unite a broad range of forces that are resolutely resisting those who, just like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind. And, naturally, the Muslim countries are to play a key role in the coalition, even more so because the Islamic State does not only pose a direct threat to them, but also desecrates one of the greatest world religions by its bloody crimes.

The ideologists (ph) of militants make a mockery of Islam and pervert its true humanistic (ph) values. I would like to address Muslim spiritual leaders, as well. Your authority and your guidance are of great importance right now.

It is essential to prevent people recruited by militants from making hasty decisions and those who have already been deceived, and who, due to various circumstances found themselves among terrorists, need help in finding a way back to normal life, laying down arms, and putting an end to fratricide.

Russia will shortly convene, as the (ph) current president of the Security Council, a ministerial meeting to carry out a comprehensive analysis of threats in the Middle East.

First of all, we propose discussing whether it is possible to agree on a resolution aimed at coordinating the actions of all the forces that confront the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. Once again, this coordination should be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter.

We hope that the international community will be able to develop a comprehensive strategy of political stabilization, as well as social and economic recovery, of the Middle East.

Then, dear friends, there would be no need for new refugee camps. Today, the flow of people who were forced to leave their homeland has literally engulfed first neighboring countries and then Europe itself. There were hundreds of thousands of them now, and there might be millions before long. In fact, it is a new great and tragic migration of peoples, and it is a harsh lesson for all of us, including Europe.

I would like to stress refugees undoubtedly need our compassion and support. However, the — on the way to solve this problem at a fundamental level is to restore their statehood where it has been destroyed, to strengthen the government institutions where they still exist or are being reestablished, to provide comprehensive assistance of military, economic and material nature to countries in a difficult situation. And certainly, to those people who, despite all the ordeals, will not abandon their homes. Literally, any assistance to sovereign states can and must be offered rather than imposed exclusively and solely in accordance with the U.N. Charter.

In other words, everything in this field that has been done or will be done pursuant to the norms of international law must be supported by our organization. Everything that contravenes the U.N. Charter must be rejected. Above all, I believe it is of the utmost importance to help restore government’s institutions in Libya, support the new government of Iraq and provide comprehensive assistance to the legitimate government of Syria.

Dear colleagues, ensuring peace and regional and global stability remains the key objective of the international community with the U.N. at its helm. We believe this means creating a space of equal and indivisible security, which is not for the select few but for everyone. Yet, it is a challenge and complicated and time-consuming task, but there is simply no other alternative. However, the bloc thinking of the times of the Cold War and the desire to explore new geopolitical areas is still present among some of our colleagues.

First, they continue their policy of expanding NATO. What for? If the Warsaw Bloc stopped its existence, the Soviet Union have collapsed (ph) and, nevertheless, the NATO continues expanding as well as its military infrastructure. Then they offered the poor Soviet countries a false choice: either to be with the West or with the East. Sooner or later, this logic of confrontation was bound to spark off a grave geopolitical crisis. This is exactly what happened in Ukraine, where the discontent of population with the current authorities was used and the military coup was orchestrated from outside — that triggered a civil war as a result.

We’re confident that only through full and faithful implementation of the Minsk agreements of February 12th, 2015, can we put an end to the bloodshed and find a way out of the deadlock. Ukraine’s territorial integrity cannot be ensured by threat of force and force of arms. What is needed is a genuine consideration for the interests and rights of the people in the Donbas region and respect for their choice. There is a need to coordinate with them as provided for by the Minsk agreements, the key elements of the country’s political structure. These steps will guarantee that Ukraine will develop as a civilized society, as an essential link and building a common space of security and economic cooperation, both in Europe and in Eurasia.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have mentioned...

- Russian and Belarusian athletes are being banned from representing their country in any and all international competitions, while the Winter Olympics was just held in concentration-camp running China. 


- Russian athletes and pro-gamers are being dropped by organizations purely based on their nationality, despite being neutral or even speaking out against the invasion.


- WEF, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, etc are all on the side of Ukraine, and suddenly now care about a country's sovereign borders. They didnt give a shit when there was an invasion of millions illegal economic migrants that are still causing trouble over a decade later.


- Large protest gatherings and influencers/activists/celebrities praising the protests just a week after being silent/condemning the protests in Canada and around the world, labelling them as ""super spreader events"".


- There's propaganda from both sides but the only side that seems to be gaining viral status and global recognition is the Ukrainian propaganda. The ""Russian"" tank driving over a car? Turns out it was Ukrainian. The ""ghost of kiev""? Bullshit. The snake island 13 martyrs? Really ~81 and they all surrendered and are alive. The shooting down of Russian jets over Kyiv? Video game footage. The tactical strike that took out some top level Russian General? He never existed. I cant think of any Russian state propaganda that has spread as quickly and freely as any of these. Also, no fact checks have been done by any of the platforms that foamed at the mouth to fact check anything during the Pandemic, even if it turned out to be true. 


- Putin is **not** hiding in the Urals. He doesnt need to. Even if he was scared of an assassination or a coup (hes not, nobody stays in power as long as he has without a tight vice on the balls of everyone around him), he is many things but hes not a coward who runs to hide in the backwaters of his country. There are plenty of safe rooms and bunkers in/near Moscow where he can still reign easily.


- EU countries planning to remove Russia from SWIFT and block offshore accounts, even though they are still incredibly dependent on Russia for energy. Are they gonna be paying Russia in crypto? That's going to do wonders for their currencies.


- There are glaring similarities between what is happening now and what has happened in the past with the West trying to overthrow regimes that dont play ball. Gaddafi, Saddam, Assad. We were all told things that justified war which turned out to either be extremely embellished or outright bullshit.


- The Ukrainian government is being labelled as these heroic victims who were thrust into such an unsuspecting situation, when anyone with an eye for geopolitics and half a brain would have seen this coming a mile off. 


- Ukraine is a highly corrupt country, and human trafficking hub thanks to its size, its location on the black sea, and its connection into Europe. There is a lot of shady things going on there, more than meets the eye.


I want to be clear, I'm not blaming the Ukrainian people, I've lived in Ukraine and they're some of the kindest people I've met. I'm also not defending Putin and his decision to invade, war is fucked. But what were seeing on Twitter or reddit or the MSM is ***not*** what is truly happening over there.


TL:DR: Please, please, dont take things at face value. After 2 years of gaslighting, projection, and lies from the media how can anyone suddenly think we're being told the truth now? Take a step back and see the hypocrisy of how the world panders to China but condemns Russia. How they congratulate BlackFace Castreau in one breath, and then condemn Russia for arresting protestors of their own. Think, please.",conspiracy,Ukraine

At the moment of me writing this im not entirely sure where this will go, but I think we can all agree that the world is completely fucked at the moment. I don't know if it was always the case throughout history, but one thing is certain - the greedy, manipulative and most power hungry people in the world are turning our beautiful mother Earth into their own personal sandbox playground with absolutely no fear of repercussions, and modern technology makes it easier than ever. 

I am 24, live in Kyiv, Ukraine, and as the mainstream media seems to point out, the world is on the constant verge of ww3 which can start at any moment via major escalation. I am personally in the first operational reserve of the army, as ex-military, along with 350,000 others. We have a 250,000 strong active army with 50,000 national guard, 120,000 territorial defense force and more than 900,000 men ready to be mobilized on top. And you're telling me Putin wants to attack us with 130,000 troops? I know he has nukes and tech superiority. Of course we are all nervous about it, and no one knows what will happen for sure, we can only prepare, but it seems like this serves as a great distraction from all the other shitshow that is going on, and it seems to me like the US wants this conflict the most by constantly bombarding everyone and everything with news that invasion is imminent. The constant negative news is crippling our economy without any invasion even happening. The richest oligarchs and some of the parliament members just flat out left the country, abandoning us. Just shows the type of people they are - make their money here and rule us, and leave when they are most needed. I am very proud of the Canadian truckers on that matter, that is what freedom fighters look like.

I am personally unvacced, but have the luxury since I work remotely. I don't want to turn this into a vaccine post, but I think by now we all now it is the worlds biggest scam, and hundred of millions of people have been forced to inject ""vaccines"" that weren't properly tested with unknown long term consequences, some of which are already becoming apparent, and suppressed. 

I've been into conspiracies for a while now. I enjoyed watching Alex Jones and Joe Rogan a lot, and I understand a lot of it seemed like crazy talk at the time, but considering how much of it turned out to be true, it gave me the mentality to question everything in my life, to seek truth, and to avoid being a mindless sheep the human race i slowly being turned into. Even based on what they put in our food, its evident they are dumbing down the ordinary folk, stopping the human race from its awakening and spiritual development. I do believe in the existence of ET's, and how we already have anti-gravity technology, know how to create free unlimited energy, and how it is all being suppressed for the sake of the oil/coal/gas corporations to maintain absolute control.  

It's a sad state of affairs. Our technology is advancing very rapidly, but our spiritual side is far behind. Materialism is being shoved down our throats like it some kind of universal truth, but there is so much more to life and who we really are than many people can imagine. We are being lied to and manipulated by the ultra wealthy and powerful every day, and at this point, I don't entirely understand how ordinary people can bring this system down, if at all. 

As bad as everything is, I still have hope for humanity and a better future. I know that love is what will save us all in the end, and it's the only way forward if humanity wishes to become a true cosmic civilization. The Lord of the Rings is my favorite movie trilogy of all time, and while a lot of the quotes there are beautiful, one stands out to me: 

Frodo : I can’t do this, Sam.

Sam : I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are.   
It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  
Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end.  
Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. 

But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass.  
A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something.

Frodo : What are we holding on to, Sam?

Sam : That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.",conspiracy,Ukraine

I've gotten in a few debates over the last few days with people who are in complete denial that Azov is a Nazi battalion.

The US Senate passed a bipartisan $1.5 trillion bill on March 10th that included $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chuck Schumer touted the aid to Ukraine and pointed to it as a pressing reason for the Senate to quickly pass the massive $1.5 trillion spending bill. This was the same week that inflation hit 7.9% in the US — the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So where is the money going? Does anyone know? Does anyone care?

Here’s one answer.

The wife of former Ukrainian MP Ihor Kotvitskyi declared 28 million dollars and 1.3 million euros when entering Hungary.

These past two years have been crammed with bizarre occurences and instances that are taking place across the world. Food shortages, factory fires, diseases, the war between Russia and Ukraine, Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, race wars, gay rights, mass shootings...everything seems to have a bit of fabrication sewn into it. 

Now, assuming that 9/11 was an inside job, what makes you think the United States government wouldn't fabricate something like a school shooting? It's one of those events that's soooooo fucked up to even lie about, that anybody who dares to question its authenticity is immediately looked down upon in the grand scheme of our society. Because why SHOULD you even question the authenticity of a school shooting? How DARE you question something so mundane and vile? It seems like the perfect opportunity TO fabricate and commission something like this. If the overarching public opinion is to shun those who question events such as 9/11 or the Highland Park shooting...then why would you stop concoting events such as these? 

I'm not coming here to say that every bad event that happens in this country is a conspiracy, but it's getting to the point where I can't help BUT question everything's authenticity. The second the Highland Park shooting happened, my mind didn't go to the families of those who lost their lives, but it went right to the ""Where does the government play into this"" mode. And maybe...just maybe...that's exactly what they want us to do. Question everything and anything that happens in this country so the truth combines with the lies and fabrications...

From the New York Times:

>After hearing President Trump tried to persuade Ukraine to investigate a 2020 campaign rival, senior officials at the White House scrambled to “lock down” records of the call, in particular the official complete transcript, a whistle-blower alleged in an explosive complaint released Thursday.

>In an attempt to “lock down” all records of the call, White House lawyers told officials to move an electronic transcript of the call into a separate system reserved for classified information that is especially sensitive, the complaint said. During the call, Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

>The president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Attorney General William P. Barr were involved in the effort as well, the complaint said.

From the New York Times:

>“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that “if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

>The president’s call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have solicited assistance in discrediting the president’s political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help.

**Potential discussion prompts:** 

- Is it appropriate for a President to publicly request aid from foreign powers to investigate political rivals? Is it instead better left to the agencies to manage the situation to avoid a perception of political bias, or is a perception of political bias immaterial/unimportant?

- The framers of the constitution were particularly concerned with the prospect of foreign interference in American politics. Should this factor into impeachment consideration and the interpretation of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' as understood at the time it was written, or is it an outdated mode of thinking that should be discarded?

It also makes me wonder that just a few days earlier, Macron all but told the world that a nuclear attack on Ukraine would not prompt France to respond with a nuclear retaliation.  

Additionally, NATO has promised extensive arms after this latest Russian onslaught by land, air and sea with Kamikaze drones. Is it possible that the Russians are about to launch a more extensive attack now before more supplies reach Ukraine which has prompted China to tell its citizens to evacuate now?

Mr. Putin, therefore, may become tempted to act sooner rather than later. Officially, Russia maintains that it has no plan to attack Ukraine at this time. 

U.S. officials saw Russia’s embassy evacuations coming. “We have information that indicates the Russian government was preparing to evacuate their family members from the Russian Embassy in Ukraine in late December and early January,” a U.S. official said in a statement.

Putin has in the past responded to such resistance such as in Syria and Chechnya with indiscriminate bombings resulting in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.

Russia has said it is standing by to continue the peace talks which was scheduled for today. Could the resistance and increased killings of civilians prompt Putin to reconsider and reach a settlement, short of what he has previously demanded of NATO?

A second person confirmed to The Associated Press that apparent Russian missiles struck a site in Poland about 15 miles from the Ukrainian border.

The Russian Defense Ministry denied being behind “any strikes on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish border” and said in a statement that photos of purported damage “have nothing to do” with Russian weapons.

A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the alliance was looking into reports of a strike in Poland. The U.S. National Security Council said it was also looking into the reports.

This does not appear to serve the Russian interest at first glance, but if U.S. intelligence confirms strikes were intentional would that obligate NATO pursuant to Article IV and V to respond and to what extent?

1. Every prominent Chinese international relations scholar except one predicted Russia would not invade.
2. Chinese officials rebuffed Biden administration representatives multiple times when presented with intelligence over the past 3 months, explicitly stating they ""did not think an invasion was in the works."" 
3. The Chinese embassy in Kyiv didn't issue evacuation notices to the 6000+ Chinese students studying in Ukraine and is now struggling to safely charter flights for them. This is highly out of character for a country that prides itself on looking out for its overseas citizens and makes propaganda films like ""Wolf Warrior"" to emphasize it.
4. While not explicitly supporting either Ukraine or Russia, China has expressed its displeasure of the invasion by having its state-owned banks restrict financing Russian commodities, abstaining from the UN Security Council vote, not helping Russia evade sanctions thus far, implicitly criticizing nations who ""unscrupulously damage other countries' sovereignty,"" and openly calling for negotiations and peace.

The Stimson Center's explanation for China's massive oversight in spite of their own satellite intelligence was their military philosophy based on Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War,"" which stresses ""winning without fighting"" and views all-out warfare as the least desirable tactic to be used only as a last resort. The Chinese expressed support for Putin's anti-NATO position before the Olympics fully expecting him to surround Ukraine with troops and negotiate from a position of strength, as they might do. Instead, Putin cashed their support in as a blank check for a full-scale invasion that united the West in fury and placed China in the crosshairs as a potential accomplice.

Aside from that the only actual change on the Russian front that took place is that Putin issued a decree that made General Sergei Surovikin, responsible for the execution of the Ukraine Front

This Russian General was described by the British Ministry of Defense as “brutal and corrupt.”  Four years after he ordered soldiers to shoot protesters in Moscow in 1991, Gen. Surovikin was found guilty of stealing and selling weapons. He was sentenced to prison although he was let off following allegations that he was framed.  

Gen. Surovikin, 55, earned a fearsome reputation in 2017 in Syria where Putin propped up the regime of his ally Bashar al-Assad by bombing Aleppo.

Since the start of August, Ukrainian forces equipped with US long-range artillery, Western intelligence and British infantry training have pushed Russian forces back from around Kharkiv in the north-east and near Kherson in the south.

Russian bloggers and online propagandists have accused Russian military commanders of incompetence, but they also welcomed Gen. Surovikin’s appointment.

Not only have there been hundreds of cease-fire violations in Ukraine’s eastern territories controlled by Russia-backed separatists as of late, there have been numerous reports that Russia is massing an unusual number of troops on its border with Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, these recent events have alarmed NATO and sparked much speculation as to Russia's next moves and ultimate aims.

Biden in his first telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy affirmed “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression,” according to a statement from the White House. Meanwhile, the 30 members of NATO have sent envoys to discuss the situation and express concern. On the other hand, the Kremlin warned that any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine would escalate tensions further and prompt Russia to take additional measures to protect itself.

Scholars and policy experts have speculated that Russia might be testing the waters and probing how the new Biden administration will react. However, some have not ruled out another full invasion and land grab by Russia. This is particularly because Crimea has been suffering from a debilitating water crisis ever since Ukraine shut down the [North Crimea Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Crimean_Canal). This action in the aftermath of the annexation has devastated the agricultural industry of the region and created huge financial strain on Russia. Last month, the Ukrainian government reaffirmed that they won't turn the water back on until Crimea is returned to them. It's therefore likely that Putin is planning, or at least considering, to further invade Ukraine to capture the source of the canal, and turn the water back on by force.

2. The invasion is primarily a result of Putin's desire to recreate a ""Greater Russia"" and is essentially driven by imperialistic ambitions rather than a reaction to anything Ukraine, NATO, or the west more broadly has done.

Macron, in a TV interview Wednesday night, gave a long and sometimes-ambiguous discussion of how France might react if Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear force were to come true.

His answer, to the France 2 network, suggested that such an event may fall short of France's own threshold for striking back.

The position was at odds with a much firmer statement by G7 countries Monday, in which France and other nations warned of ""severe consequences"" to the Russian use of nuclear weapons.

Macron was asked: ""Would France consider a tactical strike by Russia as a nuclear strike?""

 He replied: ""France has a nuclear doctrine. It lies in the nation's fundamental interests that are clearly defined. They wouldn't be questioned should there be a ballistic nuclear attack.""

France's [current nuclear policy](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04079/) is to use nuclear weapons only in self-defense, a definition Macron suggested would not be met by an attack on an allied nation like Ukraine.

Macron also tweeted on Wednesday: ""We do not want a World War.""

It came after the joint G7 statement, in which member states — including the nuclear-armed US, France, and UK, said: ""We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences."" 

His comments elicited biting criticism from several people including Ukrainian Journalist. Kate Levchuk who on Thursday slammed French President [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/emmanuel-macron) for his tweet after saying in a Wednesday interview that France would ""evidently"" avoid using nuclear weapons in case of a Russian nuclear attack in Ukraine.

Putin had been hesitant in the past, but now he could change his strategy. He will be giving a nationally televised speech on Ukraine Wednesday \[rescheduled from Tuesday\]; he may well approve of some limited martial law and escalate; if escalation occurs, it may well be reminiscent of attacks on Grozny in Chechnya and Aleppo in Syria. 

The Russian State Duma, \[its lower house of parliament\], passed on Tuesday a proposal which would allow concepts of 'mobilization' and 'martial law' into the criminal code.

Russia's parliament further approved harsher punishments for certain crimes, including desertion, harming military property and insubordination during military operations. A copy of the proposal suggests that voluntary surrender will be a punishable crime by ten years in prison, according to Reuters.

This movement coincides Ukraine's success, Russian occupied regions in the Donbas region announced on Tuesday that they would hold referendums to join Russia. According to RBC, the Russian backed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic will have a referendum on uniting with Russia between September 23 and September 27 - from this weekend. This may well include the partially occupied Kherson region. 

Ukraine for its part has maintained that only force can resolve its conflict and take back its territories. It has further asserted that the referendum only demonstrates Russian weakness. U.S. has rejected the upcoming referendum as a sham. 

Must US and NATO respond with direct involvement or should it ask Ukraine to compromise. Is there another alternative?

A few days earlier tensions soared in northern Kosovo after unknown attackers exchanged gunfire with police and threw a stun grenade at European Union officers overnight.

Animosity mounted after Kosovo scheduled local elections in four ethnic Serb-majority municipalities in the north for December 18, with the main Serb political party saying it would stage a boycott.

Explosions and shootings were heard earlier this week as election authorities tried to prepare the ground for the vote, while an ethnic Albanian policeman was wounded after law enforcement was deployed in the region.

Hundreds of ethnic Serbs, outraged over the arrest of a former police officer, gathered early last Sunday at roadblocks they erected the previous day, paralyzing traffic at two border crossings from Kosovo towards Serbia.

Serbian officials claim that the NATO and European Union-led peacekeeping missions are unable to protect the minority Serbs in Kosovo from harassment by majority Kosovo Albanians and that their security forces can do the job.

Aside from requesting authorization from NATO to send its own troop to Kosovo \[which it expects to be denied\], Serbia also raised combat readiness of its troops on the border with Kosovo and warned it would not stand by if Serbs in Kosovo, who make up less than 10% of Kosovo’s population, are attacked.

RAND's analysis suggests territorial debate is too narrowly focused on one dimension of the war’s trajectory. Territorial control, although immensely important to Ukraine, is not the most important dimension of the war’s future for the United States.

RAND concludes that, in addition to averting possible escalation to a Russia-NATO war or Russian nuclear use, avoiding a long war is also a higher priority for the United States than facilitating significantly more Ukrainian territorial control.

Furthermore, RAND acknowledges that the U.S. ability to micromanage where the line is ultimately drawn is highly constrained since the U.S. military is not directly involved in the fighting. Enabling Ukraine’s territorial control is also far from the only instrument available to the United States to affect the trajectory of the war. RAND highlighted several other tools—potentially more potent ones—that Washington can use to steer the war toward a trajectory that better promotes U.S. interests. Whereas the United States cannot determine the territorial outcome of the war directly, it will have direct control over these policies.

The alternative, RAND asserts, is a long war that poses major challenges for the United States, Ukraine, and the rest of the world.

Under what conditions, if any, can Ukraine find such a negotiated solution palatable?

The news has gotten me thinking about other celebrities and non-political figures who have run for elected office. Here is a list off the top of my head of some famous people who later served in office:  
  
* Donald Trump - The most famous and timely, Trump was a reality TV star and businessman before running in 2016.  
  
* Ronald Reagan - Reagan was a B-list movie star and President of the Screen Actors Guild before being elected in 1980.  
  
* Jesse Ventura - Ventura was professional wrestler who was served as Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota before winning an upset victory in the 1998 Minnesota Governor's race.  
  
* Al Franken - Franken was a writer on the popular SNL show during the 1970's and 1980's and a radio host before being elected to the Senate in 2008.  
  
* Volodymyr Zelensky - Zelensky was a comedian and comedy writer who was elected as President of Ukraine in 2019.  
  
* Arnold Schwarzenegger - Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder and actor before being elected as Governor of California during the 2003 recall election. He is the most recent Republican Governor of California.  
  
* Burgess Owens - Owens was a 10 season professional football player who was elected to Congress in 2020

As a matter of background, Klitschko supported President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's opponent in the presidential election in 2019. But the war unified Ukrainians and pushed most internal political differences to the side.

The [energy deprivation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/27/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-277) facing Ukrainians has renewed tensions between Ukraine’s president and Kyiv’s mayor amid a looming power crisis and the winter period setting in.

In his nightly video address on Friday, Zelenskyy said the Kyiv mayor [had not done enough](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/26/zelenskyy-criticises-kyiv-mayor-klitschko-over-power-cuts) to help beleaguered residents. “To put it mildly, more work is needed,” he added.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Sunday defended himself against allegations levelled by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that too many Kyiv residents were still without power and that centers that had been set up for them to stock up on food, water, battery power and other essentials were insufficient

 Klitschko wrote on Telegram that hundreds of such centers are in operation, as well as hundreds of emergency generators, adding that “I do not want, especially in the current situation, to enter into political battles. It’s ridiculous.”

Klitschko, who had been mired in several disputes with Zelenskyy before the invasion, said the president’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts, including “incomprehensible photos” posted online.

 “To put it mildly, this is not nice. Not for Ukrainians or for our foreign partners,” Klitschko said.

The Russian invasion in February has transformed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from a leader with sagging popularity into one of the world's most famous political figures. Yet before the war, Klitschko was better known globally, at least to boxing fans.  

Even when the Russians were nearby, Klitschko never stopped working out of City Hall, a massive stone building in the center of Kyiv, surrounded by sandbags. He said in a recent interview with *The Sunday Times* that he's left the city just twice since the war began. 

 Is Klitschko, a potential challenge to Zelensky?

There is no more Warsaw Pact. The EU centralizes Europe to an extent(albeit more economically than militarily) and there's the United Nations Security council which accounts for the worlds superpowers and the veto gives France, the U.K. and the US the power to block motions from China and Russia and vice versa. I've heard people argue that Putin wants to destabilize EU and NATO but how is NATO at all as important as the EU in the modern age? And if it exists to protect Europe from Russia then couldn't the argument be made that there should also be protection put in place against the US given our track record in the Middle East and South America? So why do NATO deserve to exist in the 21st century?

Edit: Let me clarify something. I'm not saying the US would go to war in Europe. I'm saying that the US(the most powerful member of NATO) has relationships with countries, like Cuba, Chile, Iran etc., that are comparable to Russia's relationship with Poland, Romania, Ukraine etc.. I would even go as far to say that the US has a more imperialistic track record than Russia/USSR. There was a time when NATO(united military of capitalist countries) was at odds with the Warsaw Pact(united military of socialist states), but the Warsaw Pact is gone. And I see that Russia is a threat to former eastern bloc states and I know that it is powerful and but other countries in the modern day could say the same thing about the US(from a Syrian perspective, what is the difference between Russian interference and US interference).

Thus, having Ukraine in NATO might lead to war with Russia, or undermine the world's belief in article 5 if Russia attacks Ukraine and we *don't* respond. Both of these are hideous outcomes which is why almost all international relations experts don't want Ukraine in NATO.

If the party of the incumbent president loses six or more keys, a president from the opposing party is expected to win the next presidential election. This has predicted the outcome for every presidential election since 1984 except for the 2000 election.

Link: [https://pollyvote.com/en/components/models/mixed/keys-to-the-white-house/](https://pollyvote.com/en/components/models/mixed/keys-to-the-white-house/)

1. The party of the incumbent president made gains in the house of representatives in the midterm: As of November 13, 2022, we do not know whether democrats will retain a majority in the house. What we do know is that they have lost seats.
2. It's pretty clear which candidate will win the primary of the incumbent president's party: There's talk on whether Biden will run again. If he does, this point will favor the odds of a democrat winning the 2024 election.
3. The incumbent president will be running again: Like key 2, this is contingent on whether Biden runs again.
4. No third party candidate holds significant support: We'll have to wait and see for the 2024 campaign. If DeSantis runs for president and wins the primaries, Trump may run as a third party candidate.
5. There is no recession during the election campaign: This one is up in the air but economists are predicting a recession.
6. Real per capita economic growth exceeds that of the previous two terms: Although inflation and more expensive consumer goods have made headlines, US GDP growth has been so far good to Biden. If a recession does come, it could undermine overall GDP growth, hurting Biden.
7. The incumbent party's administration achieved major policy change: Biden has accomplished a few policy changes, mostly him undoing what Trump did.
8. No social unrest: So far, there's been no significant social unrest but anything can happen in two years.
9. The incumbent president has not faced a major scandal since taking office: Biden has not faced a major scandal since taking office.
10. Major foreign policy success: The Ukraine war seems to be going well. Since the US is sending supplies to Ukraine, Biden may get credit for this.
11. Major foreign policy failure: Biden has faced blame for the withdrawal of Afghanistan.
12. The candidate from the incumbent's party is charismatic or a national hero: Sleepy Joe Biden may have roused up some support from that speech but it's still a far cry from the likes of JKF, FDR, and Ronald Reagan. Nor was he a national hero like Ulysses S. Grant or Dwight Eisenhower.
13. The challenger is not charismatic or a national hero: We can't be sure since the GOP primaries have yet to even start but it doesn't look like Biden will be facing any charismatic candidates.

The republicans have taken three keys for sure. Three are securely in the hands of Biden. The rest are up in the air. If Biden chooses to run again, Trump runs as a third party candidate after DeSantis wins, and there's a recession in 2024, that would be six keys for the republicans, just enough to favor DeSantis over Biden.

Just to be clear, this has much more to do with the perceptions of voters rather than a perfectly rational outlook. For example, Joe Biden may not necessarily be to blame for the lackluster withdrawal from Afghanistan but the voters nonetheless blame him for it. Same can be said for the war in Ukraine. As for the GDP key, the incumbent president isn't so much being graded on how well the economy is doing as he is compared to how good it was in the past. In that case, it might not be as difficult for Biden to retain this key as it first appears since the previous two terms would be Trump's one term and Obama's second term, neither of which saw stellar GDP growth. Social unrest is a key because people want to feel safe. Trump may not have been to blame for the death of George Floyd but the ensuing protests and riots certainly painted him in a bad light.

You might notice that none of these keys touch upon the election campaign itself. That's because American voters ultimately care about the quality of governance. If they are satisfied with how the government was run in the previous term, they will keep it going. If not, they will seek a change. If this model is anything to go by, voters are more likely to be swayed by performance in the past than promises for the future. Anyone can promise anything but it takes good governance to deliver good results.

You might also notice that none of this concerns how close candidates are to the center. In fact, many charismatic candidates tend to be further from the center such as FDR who pushed the new deal or Ronald Reagan who was most certainly further from the center than Jimmy Carter. If the American people are satisfied or unsatisfied with the quality of governance over the past four years, they don't necessarily care about how close to the center the candidates are.

I think it's worth talking about the 2000 election and why Republicans ended up winning despite only taking 5 keys. It bears worth mentioning that Al Gore still won the popular vote and that it all hinged on Florida. I don't know why Florida was so close but even though Ralph Nader got fewer than 5% of the popular vote in that state, he still got many more votes than the amount by which Bush lead Gore. In light of that, it's possible that republicans will take 6 or more keys, yet still not take the presidency, simply because Trump loses the primaries and decides to run third party, spoiling the race for DeSantis. The keys may moreso reflect whether more people vote for a conservative or progressive politician as opposed to which candidate gets the most votes. Even though the guide says that third party candidates work against the incumbent, they can spoil the election for a challenger. I mgiht also add that I don't really see the voters trying to compare economic growth under Biden's current term to Obama's second term since they're both democrats, Obama will most certainly endorse Biden, and because Biden is riding Obama's legacy. I can see what it's going for by comparing the economy under the current term to the previous two but it will likely be to Trump's term as opposed to Trump's term and Obama's second term.

The Magnitsky Act was passed in response to the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison, and provides a mechanism for sanctioning individuals for human rights abuses. Russia's reaction to passage was a ban on US adoption of Russian children, as well as travel bans on a list of US officials, along with ongoing lobbying efforts.

The initial sanctions list included individuals directly connected to Magnitsky's death, with more individuals added over the years. According to the [Treasury website](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/), there are currently 44 individuals sanctioned under Magnitsky. I will include the list in the comments section. There are also a variety of downloadable SDN lists (specially designated nationals and blocked persons) available via the Treasury site.

Given the relatively small size of the list, this could be viewed as a rather specific grant of authority. With sanctions over Ukraine, Crimea, and Russian meddling in our elections, are Magnistky sanctions getting special attention? Should they?",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

Protests have been ongoing in Ukraine since Viktor Yanukovich stated that he would abandon efforts to strengthen trade agreements on November 21st of 2013.  Indeed, there have been no shortage of protests since the Orange Revolution in 2004.

However, until about 48 hours ago, the protests remained quite peaceful.

And what did Yanukovich do?  He first ignored them, then dismissed them, and ultimately imposed draconian laws making various forms of protest fucking illegal.  Cue the Berkut forces and Titushkas.

Now, shit gets real.  Who knows who provoked whom first, but at the end of the day violence breaks out.  Protesters start setting fire to shit, including cops.  The cops beat the shit out of people.  Individuals in the opposition are killed, with strong implications it was done very brutally.  Government offices get stormed.  You know the deal.

Only then does serious coverage start happening, and the rest of the world start giving two fucks.  Hell, CNN finally broke down and pulled Bieber off its front page.

Not everything that happens in the world is the president’s fault. Sometimes you are given a bad hand of cards, and you do the best you can do with those cards. 

Let’s take a look at the three overarching issues that have led to the cratered approval ratings of this administration: economy, pandemic, and war. 

The Trump administration, however you may feel about Trump, have enjoyed historic economic gains. Of course, these gains cannot be sustainable forever. As fast as the economy shoots up, it’s destined to come back down. Anyone, even if it were Trump in office now, would see these historic inflations.  Because historic gains lead to historic inflations, and we have a recession about every 10 years in this country. So how has the Biden admin dealt with this issue? Biden has sent out money to everyone to help stimulate the economy and is currently raising interest rates to slow down inflation, while also being careful as to not crumble the economy. 

Secondly, we have Covid. That’s an unforeseen and frankly, unstoppable, pandemic that could have happened no matter who’s in office. Again, we must look to how this administration has reacted to it. The Biden admin distributed testing and vaccines nationwide, at record volumes and record speed. But viruses, as viruses naturally do, have mutated and now we have various forms of Covid to deal with. This pandemic is an ongoing problem that we’ll probably wrestle with in some form for the next decade. 

Finally, we have war. Russia decides to attack Ukraine and the world has to figure out how to deal with this. Fighting back with troops is out of the question, since no one in their right mind wants world war 3. Short from war, Biden and his European allies have done everything else. Give weapons to Ukraine? Check. Sanction Russia? Check. It’s so severe that the Russian economy is crumbling before our eyes, and innocent Russian people are suffering. But this was a a sacrifice that needed to be made to respond to Putin. 

So, that leads us, to why the Biden administration sees itself with terribly low approval ratings. Is it because the Biden admin hasn’t been public enough touting their own efforts and achievements?  Is it because after all of this, the public still doesn’t feel like the Biden admin hasn’t done enough? Is it because no one knows or cares about what the Biden admin has done, but seeing food and gas prices as historically high prices is enough to lose confidence in this administration? 

Where is the disconnect?",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine
104,Two main Russian state media outlets have released op-eds on the Clinton/Trump race. What does the wording of these articles say about the Kremlin's stance on the candidates?,76.0,4vz6gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4vz6gm/two_main_russian_state_media_outlets_have/,25.0,1470239554.0,"Excerpts and my analysis appear below

RT:

>Despite a concerted campaign in America to link the Republican nominee with the Kremlin, there is no evidence to support the narrative that the Russian government wants Donald Trump to become the next US President. 

>To anyone who lives in Russia, or has spent considerable time here, the notion that Moscow could recruit Trump and bend him to its bidding is frankly preposterous. Russia remains a great power, but one with considerable domestic challenges, economically and socially. As a consequence, its authorities, to state the completely obvious, have better things to do than conniving overseas on this scale. Not to mention that Trump is so erratic that you’d barely trust him with a drinks order, let alone a plan so cunning and convoluted that even John Le Carré wouldn’t touch it. It’s really that ludicrous.

>Armed with this knowledge, it’s reasonable to assume that Putin is not very excited about a putative US supremo, who in a moment of remarkable hyperbole, equated him to a man responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians. But that doesn’t mean Putin, a politician of immense experience, is overjoyed about the prospect of Trump either. If mere words were all it took to discommode the President, he’d hardly have survived close to two decades on the frontline of Russian politics.

>And so this brings us to the man they call ‘the Donald.’ It's hard to swallow the notion that Russia’s highly educated elite could favor anybody this uncouth and unstable. His foreign policy suggestions on NATO might sound like music to Kremlin ears, but the rest of his platform doesn’t. Trump isn’t merely proposing an American rethink on NATO-area Europe, but a wider American withdrawal from the world and an extremely isolationist outlook.

This appears very much addressed at the recent hacking controversy, but it looks to me to be almost as negative to Trump as to Clinton. 

Sputnik:

>Trump Probably Makes Russia Nervous Despite Backing Crimea Secession

>US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s call for improved relations with Moscow and his apparent backing of Crimea’s decision to secede from Ukraine are unlikely to inspire confidence in Russia.

>""It strains credulity beyond the breaking point that Putin would want Trump to be president of the United States, unpredictable as he is,"" McGovern, who briefed three US presidents and headed the CIA’s Soviet policy branch, told Sputnik on Monday.

>The whole premise is crazy, McGovern noted, that Trump’s embrace of better US-Russian ties somehow makes Putin a fan.

>""I know a little bit about Russian and Soviet leaders,” McGovern added.  “The last thing they want is somebody who is proud of being unpredictable and who gets irate at the slightest slight.”

>That Putin, McGovern added, would want Trump to have his finger on the nuclear button “is a leap of faith that I cannot possibly make and remain sane.”

>""With respect to Hillary, I’m saying there’s no lesser of two evils,"" McGovern said. ""I don’t think he [Putin] wants Trump to win. I don’t think he wants Hillary to win either.""

Germany opposes the initiative.

Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas would like to see an EU-wide travel visa ban on the Russian citizens in the next package of the bloc’s sanctions against Moscow. She said *“visiting Europe is a privilege not a human right”* and insisted that it was *“time to end tourism from Russia now”.*

Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin added it was *“not right”* that Russians are living a *“normal life”* while so many across Ukraine are going through such destruction.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, argued that *“it is hard to imagine”* that Schengen visas for Russians would be banned. The German leader said that the responsibility for the conflict in Ukraine lies with the Russian government and not its people.

There's two parts to the discussion I want to have.  There's a short version with just the question, then a longer version with more of an explanation.

**1.** **Short:** How do you think Sanders' foreign policy would actually play out?  I've been digging into his foreign policy positions some today, and the things I've read provide a somewhat conflicting message.  On one hand, he seems supportive of humanitarian intervention.  On the other, he seems unwilling to commit in ways often necessary to solve the conflicts.

**Long:** There's ample evidence to show that Bernie is not opposed to intervention when human rights violations, especially genocide and ethnic cleansing, are occurring.  He voted ""nay"" on a House resolution to criticize President Clinton for sending troops to Bosnia in 1995, he supported NATO airstrikes in the Kosovo War in 1999, and more recently maybe, possibly supported intervention in Libya (feelthebern.org seems intentionally ambiguous on Libya) with reservations about the cost and potential for a dragged out conflict.

At the same time, he seems unwilling to truly commit to these conflicts.  In 1999 at a [town hall meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dazZyVW7DaQ), he talks at length about how we can't allow ethnic cleansing and genocide, but then also talks at length about avoiding another Vietnam by not putting troops on the ground.  In [this interview](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/06/08/interview_with_senator_bernie_sanders_110147.html) with Wolf Blitzer, he steers questions about Libya and Syria (in 2011) into rhetoric about American infrastructure.  He opposes NATO-expansion because it would unnecessarily provoke Russia (feelthebern.org), but it's a weak NATO response to Russia's growing geopolitical aspirations, not a strong response, that has allowed Russia to annex part of Ukraine and wage a proxy war via pro-Russian rebels.  Even his platform on ISIS seems to have less US involvement than the already small role the US currently plays in Iraq and Syria.

All of this, to me, paints the picture of someone who wants to have their cake and eat it, too.  He wants to respond to humanitarian issues without actually putting much American skin in the game.  Which is an easy position to have in Congress, but not as easy as President.  Airstrikes and diplomacy were enough in Kosovo, but what happens when they aren't?  Do we just up and leave, like we did in Somalia?  Do we fail to commit to the follow through, like in Libya?  If we think it's too difficult to get involved, like Syria circa 2011/2012, do we just ignore it altogether?

**2.** **Short:** Why do you think Hillary Clinton is hawkish or even conservative on foreign policy and intervention?  Not to invalidate this opinion, just that I'm curious what evidence you see that makes you believe this to be true.  Ultimately, what do you think would be the differences in their intervention forays over the next 8 years?

**Long:** In my opinion, the idea that Clinton is hawkish on intervention traces back to her vote on Iraq.  However, 58% of Democrat Senators voted for the Iraq Resolution, including a who's who of today's Democrat leadership.  Clinton's Iraq war vote, however, was used by Obama in 2008 to paint Clinton as the more hawkish candidate.  Clinton is definitely on the interventionist side of the party, but she's still leagues away from conservative neo-con war hawks.  Just listen to her talk foreign policy during a debate, then listen to the current Republican candidates talk foreign policy.  But the idea that Clinton is a hawk who's gonna start a bunch of wars has continued to be perpetuated since the 2008 primary to the point where it no longer has to be substantiated to be taken as true.  This is a bit frustrating to me, because we have 4 years of her as Secretary of State to look at, and they're typically ignored in favor of rhetoric about her Iraq Resolution vote.",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

In the U.S. I could imagine it being something like 6-10$ gallons of oil, and...have literally no idea what could happen in Europe.  But are the average citizens of nations willing to make this sacrifice?

Edit/More Info people have pointed out:

1. The U.S. is 100% energy independent and is in no danger of physically running out of oil (the same cannot seemingly be said for Europe?)
2. Since oil markets are connected and America is a capitalist/free-market nation, if the price of oil increases in Europe, this will cause a proportional increase of price in America (U.S. companies won't sell gas for less in the U.S. than what they can get abroad).",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

A dysfunctional, chaotic Syria was preferable to stability with an Assad in power, able to free up of Iran's Shia Crescent. You can still see the U.S presence blocking a major highway in from Iraq.

There are some parallels here to Russia/Ukraine. If Russia cannot enforce regime change, Ukraine as a failed state could be preferable to Ukraine as a stable, western ally. The big difference is that while America could just fund proxies in Syria to prolong the war, Russia does not have that luxury, so it would be a massive commitment. Could Russia go here?

It has become increasingly well-known that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections, but this followed decades of other efforts to interfere. This information should not be partisan, but it has become that way, in large part because of Trump’s incredulity to that fact. Nevertheless, multiple intel sources have brought this reality to light, [including Robert Mueller regarding the 2020 election](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/25/robert-mueller-warned-2020-russian-election-interference-what-happened-2016/1827616001/).

## Sweden
Russia aimed to decrease voter trust in the election system and discourage their potential membership in NATO. Responses:

 - Trained local election workers to identify and combat interference

 - Media was used to combat fake news

 - A daily newsletter exposing disinformation was published to assist news media

 - Media literacy was expanded in schools

## France
Russia aimed to divide French society. They even hacked Macron’s campaign and dumped information online. France did the following:

 - Open a workshop for campaigns to increase cybersecurity

 - Raise public awareness of Russia’s intentions

 - Pressured Facebook to close fake accounts

 - [Directly addressed and accused Putin of using RT and Sputnik as propaganda networks](https://www.france24.com/en/20170530-macron-rt-sputnik-lying-propaganda-putin-versailles-russia-france-election)

 - Attempted to create an early warning system for Russian propaganda. This system has apparently not been very effective due to free speech implications.

## Britain
Russia was very pro-Brexit. This is what Britain did:

 - Theresa May directly accused Putin of planting fake stories in the media

 - Set up a security communications unit. Unknown how effective it is.

## Others

* Hit by soaring oil import costs and a dip in tourism revenue, Sri Lanka is racing to avert a default amid dwindling foreign-exchange holdings.

How much debt is Sri Lanka in?

* Authorities are struggling to contain the crisis. They've raised interest rates, devalued the local currency, and placed curbs on non-essential imports. But with a meager $2 billion in forex reserves and $7 billion in debt payments due this year, the battle is turning uphill.

Sri Lanka's economy is being crushed by war in Ukraine

* One of Europe's worst conflicts since World War II couldn't have come at a worse time for Sri Lanka, which is still recovering from a brutal 30-year ethnic strife that ended in 2009.

Nearly half of Sri Lanka's wheat comes from Ukraine

* 45% of Sri Lanka’s wheat imports are sourced from Russia and Ukraine. In addition, more than half of Sri Lanka’s imported soybeans, sunflower oil and seeds, and peas are from Ukraine. Overall, Russia and Ukraine account for 2% of Sri Lanka’s imports and 2.2% of exports in 2020.

What does Sri Lanka's crisis mean for Europe?

* The crisis in Sri Lanka is yet another reminder for the rest of the world that unless the Ukraine crisis is immediately resolved, the inflationary pressure in the Western markets, due to high energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks, will continue to increase. There is also a growing tendency for increased military expenditure in the long run, which might reduce the “peace dividends” for European households. 

Violent protests ensue due to the rising cost of living

* Civic groups have held vigils highlighting rising costs, while the main opposition party organized a mass rally in the capital city of Colombo on March 15. But two weeks later, anger against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s handling of the crisis has spiraled into violence, as hundreds of protesters clashed with police for several hours on March 31.

How is Sri Lanka dealing with the crisis?

* The nation's international bonds need to be restructured by July as Sri Lanka doesn't have the necessary resources to pay the $1 billion due that month, Citigroup said in Feb. Besides raising borrowing costs and devaluing the rupee, Central Bank of Sri Lanka also urged restrictions on non-essential imports of around 300 items from electronic appliances to apples and increases in fuel prices and power tariffs.",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

This is self-explantory.

4**) They don't have a major diaspora nor are they prominent in the media.** 

Ukraine was in the news because of the impeachment, plus people have been more aware of them since the 2014 Crimean invasion. Moldova isn't in the media and frankly most people haven't even heard of it.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and and annexation of it's territory has shocked the international community and has shown that Russia has little regard for the sovereignty of its neighbors and is willing to use force against peaceful nations. The threat of Russian invasion is deeply troubling to America's allies in Eastern Europe and has negatively affected the world economy and is destabilizing the region. Russia's gradual shift away from democracy is also very troubling to the international community. 

The 2nd challenge the world is facing is Isis, or more broadly speaking, Islamic extremism. Syria, Iraq, and Libya have become the battleground of Muslim extremists, disenfranchised ethnic groups, anti government rebels, the former governments of the regions, and a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. Isis has invaded the territory of Iraq, an ally whose government the U.S. put in power at the cost of thousands of lives and billions of dollars. The U.S. has done little to aid Iraq except the occasional airstrikes and has let an allied nation become partly occupied by a terrorist state without much of a fight. Syria, whose government was ally of Iran and Russia, Is currently fighting a war against rebels, terrorists, and the Kurdish people. U.S. supported forces have made little headway during the war and Russia has entered the conflict and is supporting government forces. The conflict has caused many middle eastern people to migrate to Europe, which threatens to destabilize the EU and cause division among the EU member states.

Without a doubt, the international community is facing a crisis. The U.S., the worlds only superpower has done little to effectively aid or allies or improve the situation, and has remained relatively ineffective in its job to be a stabilizing force in the world.

This statement along with [other](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nord-stream-2-companies-exclusive-idUSKBN2AO285) actions proves that the US is very determined to stop Nord Stream 2. I see the following possible reasons for the US to do this:

1. It is beneficial to the US gas exporters 
2. It helps to contain Russia
3. It helps Ukraine a lot

At the same time everything has its price, and the price the US is paying is:

1. Worsening the relations with Europe and especially Germany (they don't like the US's meddling in European affairs)
2. Killing a chance to normalize the relations with Russia

For me (*disclaimer: I'm Russian, so I'm very biased here*) it isn't obvious whether such course of action really coincides with the US interests. Worsening the relations with Europe is a big price to pay, having cold-war-like relations with a nuclear-weapon state is also a questionable idea (unfortunately, the worse the relations, the higher the probability of misfortunate accidents). The economic benefit for the US gas exporters doesn't seem to be the main reason here. Stopping Nord Stream 2 would indeed contain Russia and help Ukraine, but why is it needed? Russia is objectively weak, so why the US thinks that it need to be contained even at the cost of the relations with Europe? How does it help the US?

>So, let me spend the rest of my time describing my vision for how
the United States of America, and our military, should lead in the
years to come, for you will be part of that leadership...

While he certainly has a fair bit to say before and after that mark, both the President [and Pundits seem to be trumpeting his speech as a turn](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/obama-west-point-foreign-policy/index.html) in American foreign policy. This seems to me to be a great place to start when reviewing the speech.

>First, let me repeat a principle I put forward at the
outset of my presidency: the United States will use military force,
unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it, when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the
security of our allies is in danger.

This seems to be very much the position of every presidency to me. Does it differ from Bush or before?

>For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism. But a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is naive and unsustainable. I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy, drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold.

I'm not sure why the President is not trumpeting Libya as a success or failure to learn from here. In fact, he really doesn't mention the 2011 military engagement with Libya that lasted 9 months and had [10,000 sorties and toppled the government there at all in this speech.](http://world.time.com/2012/05/16/how-many-innocent-civilians-did-nato-kill-in-libya/) But again, I don't really see how this idea is unique or different to US policy. We have always sought allies and always will.

>And the need for a new strategy reflects the fact that today's
principal threat no longer comes from a centralized Al Qaida
leadership. Instead, it comes from decentralized Al Qaida affiliates
and extremists, many with agendas focused in countries where they
operate. And this lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style
attacks against the homeland, but it heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi. 

I'm not sure why the ""decentralized al qaida"" would be unable to mount another 9/11 style incident. That plot used 20+ people. And again... the president isn't mentioning that the attack in Benghazi that happened in 2012 occurred after the US, France and UK bombed Libya and destabilized it... He seems to be referring to it as if the US had nothing to do with the state of affairs in Libya at that point. To me, it has long been obvious that the issue he is talking about occurred because the US did not learn from the lessons of training and rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan and instead they left Libya without committing to any re-building. The result has been a long slide into a militia run country and has only grown worse over time. This seems to me to be the only moment he refers to Libya at all in the speech.

>So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse
threat, one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch
our military too thin or stir up local resentments. We need partners
to fight terrorists along-side us. And empowering partners is a large
part of what we have done and what we are currently doing in
Afghanistan.

This certainly makes sense, and is a traditional argument for all presidencies really. Why [was there an exception to this rule in Syria](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/politics/us-syria/) when the president argued for unilateral missile strikes?

>But sustaining this progress depends on the ability of Afghans to
do the job. And that's why we trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan
soldiers and police. Earlier this spring, those forces, those Afghan
forces, secured an election in which Afghans voted for the first
democratic transfer of power in their history. 

If this was so important, why was it not done in Libya?

>A critical focus of this effort will be the ongoing
crisis in Syria. As frustrating as it is, there are no easy answers
there. No military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering
any time soon.

This seems to contradict the president from a year ago in that he felt a military solution was worth a ""limited strike"".

>Let me make one final point about our efforts against terrorism.
The partnerships I described do not eliminate the need to take direct
action, when necessary, to protect ourselves. When we have actionable intelligence, that's what we do

I couldn't agree with the President more, and this sounds much the same as the Bush Doctrine.

>but as I said last year, in taking direct action, we must uphold standards that reflect our values. That means taking strikes only when we face a continuing, imminent threat, and only where there is no certainty -- where there is near certainty of no civilian casualties. For our actions should meet a simple test: we must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield.

Again, I would argue that this simple test has not been met by the way the Obama Administration left Libya. Or the way drone strikes work for that matter.

>And this issue of transparency is directly relevant to a third aspect of American leadership, and that is our effort to strengthen and enforce international order.

This has been an argument from the Administration from day 1, I think. It is certainly a sensible argument- However ""transparency"" in the days of Snowden and NSA wire taps and Drone bombing and IRS scandals seems to have a different meaning.

The president went on to talk about Russia and Ukraine, Iran and ends

>America does not simply stand for stability or the absence of
conflict no matter what the cost. We stand for the more lasting peace
that can only come through opportunity and freedom for people
everywhere.Which brings me to the fourth and final element of American leadership -- our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity.

This again rings hollow for me because of what was done in Libya, and also Syria, and Egypt during this administration. We very specifically do not commit to rebuilding or any ground troops because of the cost, and today [the US government is telling it's citizens in Libya to leave the country because it is too unstable.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27599301). The entire argument for entering Libya was to protect civilians and ""act on behalf of human dignity."" - but in the end we armed 1700 militias and left as soon as we saw evidence of Gadaffi's death. In Egypt, the President himself announced that he asked [Mubarrak to step down](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/02/04/obama-administration-urges-mubarak-to-step-down) and since then Egypt has been involved in a coup after coup. Syria's situation is far worse now than it was when it started 3 years ago, and still worse than it was a year ago when the administration publicly threatened attacks but took no action.

While much of the rhetoric seems to be in agreement with my views, I don't see where the actions hold up. It also seems to me like the majority of the rehtoric is not new at all, and exactly something Bush would outline as the ""Bush Doctrine"".

However, that system most benefits the status quo -- the countries that already enjoy natural benefits get to keep enjoying them, stemming from historical conquest or historic claims or whatever nonsense is used.

But if a country wants to better itself through some vital resource or condition, access to some river or body of water, securing more farmland or population center, how can that be accomplished now? The landlocked country of Belarus -- what if it decides that it needs a port? Will the world forbid it from marching on Lithuania or Latvia? What if Angola decides that it too wants to enjoy large Cobalt deposits? Can it decide to annex Katanga, Congo?

And if they cannot, then do we just say it was the luck of the draw that you didn't get certain resources or minerals? That seems like even more reason to invade -- by securing these areas or rights, I can set up my future generations to prosperously mine lithium, trade on the oceans or any number of things that might be important to my country.

> For Paul R Pillar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Security Studies at Georgetown University and a former senior CIA officer, the initial fault lies with the West.

> ""**The relationship went wrong when the West did not treat Russia as a nation that had shaken off Soviet Communism**,"" he told me. ""It should have been welcomed as such into a new community of nations - but instead it was regarded as the successor state of the USSR, inheriting its status as the principal focus of Western distrust.""

Sir John Sawers, the former head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), is also a former UK ambassador to the United Nations said this

> ""**If there was a clear understanding between Washington and Moscow about the rules of the road** - that we are not trying to bring down each other's systems - then solving regional problems like Syria or Ukraine or North Korea - which is coming rapidly down the path towards us - **would be easier**,"" he said.

He added: “After the coup d’etat, foreign advisers and instructors are working in Ukraine. But today, Washington essentially coordinates and develops military operations, thereby directly participating in the hostilities against our country.” 

Although the U.S. did not respond to the comments from the Russian Duma Chairman this Saturday morning \[5/07/2022\].  Last week, multiple outlets reported that U.S. intelligence had helped Ukrainians kill an increasing number of Russian Generals and others reported U.S. intelligence helped Ukrainians sink the Russian flagship Moskva in the Black Sea.    

The New York Times, for instance reported last week \[05/04/2022\], that the U.S. provided intelligence to Ukraine as part of a program to provide real-time information to aid the country’s military. 

Pentagon press secretary on Thursday \[05/05/2022\] said that while the U.S. provides intelligence to Ukraine, it doesn’t give information on the “location to senior military leaders on the battlefield.” 

On Thursday night \[5/06/2022\], [several news outlets reported](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3479159-american-intel-played-a-role-in-sinking-of-russian-warship-reports/) that American intelligence played a role in Ukraine sinking the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva.

Kirby [refuted these reports in a statement](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3479388-pentagon-denies-providing-specific-targeting-information-in-sinking-of-russian-warship/), saying “We did not provide Ukraine with specific targeting information for the Moskva. We were not involved in the Ukrainians’ decision to strike the ship or in the operation they carried out.”

Russia does not have the manpower or equipment to fight a convectional war with the U.S. even if it were to mobilize all of its reserve troops.  Although the Russian reserve has over two million former conscripts and contract servicemen on paper, few are actively trained or prepared for war. Historically, only 10 percent of reservists receive refresher training after completing their initial term of service.

Russia also lacks the administrative and financial capacity to train reservists on an ongoing basis. According to a 2019 RAND analysis, Russia only had 4,000 to 5,000 troops in what would be considered an active reserve in the Western sense, meaning soldiers attending regular monthly and annual training. 

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has repeatedly stated that the Russian Armed Forces hoped to have 80,000-100,000 active reserve members.

Putin also cannot afford to withdraw altogether from Ukraine, that leaves it only with limited options.

Given the Duma comments this Saturday and given the anticipated speech by Putin during their annual victory day parade on May 9, 2022; is Putin likely to announce a coming major escalation, but limit it to Ukrainian territories?

Biden’s approval has been stuck in the low 40s for months. Inflation has shown little sign of abating, especially with the war in Ukraine affecting fuel and food prices, and there has been talk that the economy may [soon experience a recession](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/recession-is-almost-inevitable-former-feds-ferguson-says-11651500207). Almost everyone is expecting the Democrats to lose big in this years midterm elections, essentially freezing Biden’s presidency for the remainder of his term. Obviously, the questions about Biden’s age and health will only intensify as we get closer to 2024. And just from what I have observed in online circles, there seems to be a sense of complete demoralisation and malaise among the Democrats base, whether it was the failure to pass ambitious legislation like Build Back Better due to the party’s more conservative elements like Manchin, lack of seeming progress to address the country’s various social ills, and now the prospect of Roe being overturned and restricting access to abortion for millions of American women. This has led to concerns that 2024 could see a plummet in turnout for the Democrats that would prove fatal. 

By contrast, it would appear the Republicans have all the momentum and energy on their side thanks to their mastery of political messaging and their permanently engaged base always guaranteeing high turnout from their side. This in spite of the fact that the party seems to be turning even more radical and extreme which should normally repel voters, but instead appears to be actually strengthening their coalition. 

To put it mildly, things appear so bleak and hopeless for the Democrats that I’ve seen some, perhaps half-jokingly, say that the real 2024 election will be the GOP primary.

Yet in spite of all that, I have seen those argue that it’s far too early to count Biden and the Democrats out for 2024 and that in reality, their chances of winning are better than some believe. 

As the saying goes “a year is an eternity in politics”, and the Democrats have at least two years for economic conditions, especially inflation to improve in their favour. It’s also not unheard of for incumbent presidents to rebound from a brutal midterm drubbing and win re-election as seen with Reagan, Clinton and Obama. Many have pointed out that Biden still enjoys the incumbency advantage which has traditionally been very difficult for challenging candidates to overcome. It’s been often said that Trump effectively gave away what should have been an easy re-election win due to his handling of the pandemic.

Speaking of, the likely prospect of Trump running for the presidency again is often said to be another potential factor that could help the Dems in motivating mass turnout in 2024 just to keep him from becoming president again. I’ve often heard that many of those who voted for Biden in 2020 did so less out of support for him, and more because he was “not Trump”. The prospect of another Trump term and all that implies could very well recreate that effect. 

Whereas, another Republican candidate like DeSantis could prove much more difficult for the Democrats simply because they don’t invoke the same feeling of polarisation and revulsion among Democrats as Trump does.

We know the Russians have a pretty strong foothold in Crimea, whether you recognize it as a legitimate territory of Russia now or not. 

But the Ukrainian government (and presumably now, the majority of the Ukrainian public) will never recognize its annexation to Russia, aside from the large population of Crimeans who may have supported 2014 secession.

Ukrainian control over the Donbas would likely return if the Ukrainian military capitulated the secessionist  insurgency since Russia has not claimed the territories for themselves, and you can’t recognize an “independent state” with no leadership.

But if Ukraine forces the Russian military out of its 2022 borders, Crimea will certainly need to be readdressed. 

If Ukraine wanted to take back governance and security over Crimea, would Russia see that as an invasion?

If Russia did see that as an invasion would they even be able to do anything about it following a recent defeat in Ukraine? Would any other powerful world actors see it as an invasion and act or would we return to status quo?

Lastly, would Crimeans themselves resist liberation attempts after years of Russian occupation?

Luckily for Beijing, they have a powerful navy, so they don't have to worry about Naval superiority. What they have to worry about tough is Logistics. To complete the invasion, China would have to:

1. Assert total Air and Naval Superiority over Taiwan, but Taiwanese EWS might detect the hordes of bombers and fighters heading for them, and scramble their fighters and Navy.
2. Bring an invasion force of 70,000-700,000 across a 180 Mile stretch of Water while Taiwanese Planes are bombing you.
3. Immediately start fighting in Dense, House-to-House, Urban Combat, just like those you'd find in Ukraine as soon as you get off beaches that make Omaha beach look like a joke.
4. Start fighting in steep, Forested, and Damp Jungle terrain, like the hills of Afghanistan, the trees and vegetation of Vietnam, Constant attacks from Taiwanese soldiers out of nowhere, and you're doing it all in the middle of the ocean.
5. Rule Taiwan with an iron first, keeping Tens of Thousands of men on an island while Riots, Guerilla warfare, Bombings, and Sabotage are occurring non-stop, not to mention demoralized troops.

And I've watched both the Russian state media, and feel as if I have a good feel of what narrative they want, and I've watched and read Western media, and while it's obvious that their media is more open, there still is political posturing occurring on that side as well. 

I feel that one of the most overlooked parts of this whole story is that Putin wants to act as if there is Western aggression. He wants there to be a new cold war. Why? Well Russia's economy wasn't every strong to begin with. It's still basically a 2nd World country (Or maybe a 3rd world nation) the average monthly wage there is around 700$ and the average lifespan is like 60. Corruption is rampant everywhere, and one can be faced with having to bribe people on everything from getting admitted to a college to wanting to open a shop.  Remember, this type of corruption was the same thing that created the tipping point situation in Ukraine.  Therefore it was immediately important to stress that the revolution in Ukraine wasn't about people standing up to a corrupt system and removing an absolutely corrupt leader, but instead a violent coup perpetuated by Nazis funded by the US. This may sound like something from Alex Jones, but it's actually a pretty common belief. At this point, in their minds, pretty much everything bad that happens involving Russias is the work of Western covert agents. The Tartar who was tortured and killed in Crimea for being against Putin? Most believe he was killed by Ukrainian nationalists trying to frame Russians and make them look bad. At this point everything is the fault of the West, and that's just what Putin wants, and needs to stay in power. Seriously, you wouldn't believe the amount of anti-American and anti-European attitudes on Russian state media (which is now the only media) .

On top of that there are serious ethnic problems in Russia between native Russians and ""Kavkaz"" (non natives.. In their eyes at least) . Then of course there are obvious problems between Russians and Chechens, Ingush, Dagestanis, and Central Asians. Putin needs to ""Unite"" the country somehow, and The West is the perfect target. 

And lastly, Russia is simply an incredibly depressing place. Don't get me wrong it's totally unique and badass in a multitude of ways, and has an amazing history. But at the same time, it's just fucking depressing. There's a reason why a lot of people with money or upward mobility are fleeing the country, and that's because there simply isn't a lot of opportunity. But instead of blaming the oligarchs in power, you guessed it, the blame is on The West, once again. 

So, in my opinion the best tactic would be for US and their European Allies to engage in would be one that doesn't give Putin what he wants (which I believe they currently are doing). However, I don't know a viable alternative to sanctions, and travel bans. However I feel that at the same time they will feed into the same propaganda outlets which want to shift the blame for all their ills on America and Obama.

TLDR: Putin needs the US and an ""Us vs Them"" narrative to push in order to keep his power and his people in check. Without the bogeyman of the West, the people may start blaming their own leaders, and their own government for the problems in their lives. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

I can’t imagine how it feels like to live in a regime like that, but personally it’s very easy to see them as cowardly bystanders to a brutal slaughter of civilian Ukrainians and it’s likely that they will be remembered as such. 

For me it’s also hard to understand that people just continue living their lives when their last 2-400 years of governments have repeatedly used them as cannon fodder.

It's creating an interesting atmosphere I think.  Maybe I'm wrong about some things and I'd like for you to correct me.

First off, Russia has been trying to reassert its power lately and has a military base in Syria, very close to Turkey, a NATO country, Cyprus, who has oil fields, and of course their history in Middle Eastern countries along with Israel and we all know what has been happening there.

Neo-Nazism has been gaining traction in Greece at an alarming rate and although they have been ""European"" in recent years, many Greeks feel close to Russians because they're all Orthodox Christian.  Greece has also been doing poorly economically as everyone knows and many Greeks feel some sort of, I don't know the right word, maybe anger, at the EU because this happened to them.  A lot of these Neo-Nazis hate Turks.

Then there is the issue in Ukraine where we don't know if they will join the EU or what.  They are close to Russia.  Will they kind of be like a satellite of Russia in the near future?  Will they want to try to do their own thing?

Sandwiched between Greece and Russian influence is a NATO country and important U.S. ally, Turkey. Turkey's economy has been growing very quickly and they've been doing business with Middle Eastern countries in recent years to help them grow and become a bigger influence in the area.  They have been fighting Kurds for many many years now although in recent weeks I think some agreements have been made.  Still, the Kurds want a Kurdistan on very important land to Turkey.  Eastern Turkey, right where the Kurds are, is where like 70% of the world's Boron reserves are.  Turkey can't mind this Boron until 2023 I think because of a treaty about a hundred years ago, but once they can, they are open to a 100 billion $ market.  Boron is supposedly going to be a very important source of energy in the future.  Turkish people are also very split.  You have 1/3 of the people who are more ""European"", 1/3 Kurds, and 1/3 very religious Turks.  The PM is also bat shit crazy. 

I know there is tension in Bulgaria because Turkish politicians are gaining power and that's not what most Bulgarians want.  Of course many Europeans are having trouble with Muslims and Turks.

Europe wants a pipeline going through Turkey from the Middle East for more resources but Russia wants to control this market.

i've been observing the recent events in the ukraine, and i've come up with the theory that russia does not want the ukraine to join the EU because of tensions with japan and the western world. 

Now before you jump to conclusions quickly consider this:

- in China/Japan tensions are rising, the Russians have seemed to side with china and in turn the U.S. have sided with Japan.

- now if the Ukraine were to join the EU that would make it so if there was any kind of war were to break out the U.S. and other allies would have an easy access door to Russia.

- if China and Japan were to start a war the russians would now have to fight both the east and western borders of their country, which in fact would make them vulnerable to attack especially from their western border. (with Moscow only 490km's or 300 miles from the Ukraine border).

They seem to be totally unaware of the following: 

* Bill Clinton didn't invade Iraq in the 8 years he was in office. 
* The spirit of the times in 2002 was that we should stick together and support the president, even if you didn't agree with him
* Bad intel was foisted off on members of Congress
* For that matter, it was a mostly Republican congress

The bottom line is, if Gore had been president, we wouldn't have invaded Iraq. There is evidence to suggest Bush had planned to invade Iraq BEFORE 9-11 happened. Or even before he was in office. His reasons for doing so were, quite possibly, somewhat personal (Saddam tried to murder his father). Could Bush have been presented with bad intel as well? Possibly. But the buck stops with him. 

So blaming people for supporting a president in a time of strife seems like a cheap attack. And it matters because, as we consider our leaders going forward, you've got to give the Democrats some credit for not engaging in frivolous or ""optional"" wars. I know quite a few Republicans who think Obama is ""weak"". When pressed on what they think he should be doing, usually they seem to think we should be deploying soldiers somewhere (the Ukraine, elsewhere).

Russia has had more success in the south and east of Ukraine, gaining control of a fair amount of territory. While Russia has had difficulty holding and pacifying larger cities in this region such as Mariupol, they have successfully cut them off from reinforcements and humanitarian aid. Mariupol is unlikely to be able to hold out indefinitely as food supplies dwindle. Unless Ukraine makes large territorial gains soon to break the siege, which seems unlikely, Mariupol will likely fall as its occupants either surrender, are defeated, or are rendered incapable of fighting due to starvation. This will give Russia control of a contiguous land bridge from Crimea to the previous Russian border, while also cutting Ukraine off entirely from the Sea of Azov. Russia has already started the process of kidnapping and deporting residents of this area, presumably to resettle it with Russian loyalists.

As Russian forces around Kyiv dig in and set up defensive positions, there is a growing belief that the southeastern gains were the ultimate objective all along, and Russia's ""failed"" advances in the rest of the country are simply meant to prime both Ukraine and the West to be more accepting of a scenario where Russia ""only"" gains the Donbas region and the land bridge. In exchange for being ceded those regions, Russia can pull back its forces in other parts of Ukraine as a concession, even if it never had any intention of taking and holding the rest of the country. The small Ukrainian gains around Kyiv are undercut by their seeming inability to push back the Russian forces in the southeast. If Russia abandons its attempts to seize territory in the north, this would allow both sides to bring more force to bear in the south and east, possibly shifting the dynamic of the stalemate.

As the conflict transitions to a long-term, grinding campaign, the economic fallout in Russia will only increase, as the sanctions do not look to be lifted anytime soon. Western media is full of experts claiming that Russia's economy and its oligarchs will not be able to bear these sanctions, yet day after day goes by without any sign of Russian retreat, changes in Russian demands, or even a change in Russian leadership. It appears that Putin has a tight enough grip on the country to stay in power and continue with the current strategy even in the face of continued sanctions, heavy losses/poor morale among the armed forces, and domestic protests against the war. The high cost of continuing the fight is clear at this point, but Putin still seems willing to pay it in order to achieve his goals. The West seems to have used nearly all of the diplomatic tools it is willing to; there is not much else that can be done short of a military intervention (which would be a third World War) or a complete ban on European imports of Russian oil. 

The following questions assume there are no radical departures from the current status quo: Russian forces make limited or no further territorial gains, Ukrainian forces are unable to reclaim lost territory, Mariupol remains cut off and is eventually captured, Western aid continues to pour in and allows Ukraine to continue fighting, and the sanctions are not lifted.

\- If Russian forces retreat from all of their held gains except the southeastern land bridge connecting Crimea to Russia (and perhaps the Donestk and Luhansk People's Republics in the east), will Ukraine have any appetite to continue hostilities, or will it concede those areas in exchange for stopping Russian airstrikes from causing further damage and deaths across the entire country?

\- If Ukraine continues to fight in an attempt to regain its lost territory and rescue its kidnapped citizens, do they have any chance of pushing back the Russian forces? So far, Ukrainian fighters have been incredibly effective fighting a defensive war, striking at Russian supply lines and making any gains extremely costly. However, they have not been able to demonstrate the ability to push Russian forces back from their defensive positions, except in isolated cases. Fighting an offensive war will undoubtedly be much more difficult, and while Russia has suffered heavy losses, they still have far more military strength than Ukraine if they wish to commit it.

\- Is there any realistic scenario where Russia capitulates to Ukrainian demands and gives up its territorial gains in order to stop the ongoing economic impact of the sanctions? Or will these sanctions be the ""new normal"" for Russia for the coming years and decades? The longer Ukraine can draw out the current stalemate, the more damage the sanctions will do to Russia's economy, but Ukraine will sustain more losses of property and lives as well. So far, it seems like neither side is blinking, but the costs are mounting on both sides.",PoliticalDiscussion,Ukraine

This was interpreted as a [massive gaffe](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-foreign-policy-gaffes-2016-213345) because NATO's Article V commits the USA to go to war with any country that attacks a NATO ally - so it matters a great deal whether Ukraine is in or out - but maybe Trump is simply signaling a retreat from NATO? He also said he wants South Korea to ""pay for"" the US's security guarantee - just like he wants Mexico to pay for the wall, and take a royalty from a Canadian pipeline across US soil, and impose a 35% import tariff against Japan.

**The Republican Party has traditionally been the more internationally engaged of our two parties, especially under the neocons. Is that changing?**

One thing to consider is the USA is actually the world's most isolated economic power in terms of trade. Exports/imports account for less of our GDP than Japan, Germany, the EU, or China. We look even more disengaged when you take out energy imports and the 'overland' trade with our NAFTA partners.

Here's another thing to think about. After WWII, the USA built a series of institutions including Bretton-Woods, NATO, the San Francisco Model, GATT, WTO and the UN. These institutions [have been interpreted as a decades-long trade between the USA and non-communist Europe and Asia](https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/geopolitics-united-states-part-1-inevitable-empire). The USA, as the only undamaged superpower, would take on several commitments: it would finance postwar reconstruction, unilaterally open its consumer markets, and use its military might to guarantee the freedom of the seas and international trade as a public good. These moves were deliberately designed to supercharge the shattered overseas economies. In exchange, those economies would commit to becoming satellite states under the USA's nuclear umbrella and global leadership. In this way, the USA prosecuted and won the Cold War. 

However, what is the USA's commitment to this series of institutions now that the Cold War is done? Despite Putinism, Russia's demographic and economic problems are so severe that she can never become more than a regional power. The USA used to be extremely sensitive to freedom of the seas because of energy imports, but in the long term with shale and renewables that could change.

Granted a lot of that comes from the right wing, which will criticize him no matter what he does. 

But, could this be a case where being ""tougher"" actually be the best course of action?

In Syria, there's a strongman dictator that has taken a brutal stance against his own people. He's obviously better equipped and he's using that military to law waste to entire cities. The chemical attack, whether it came from him or someone under him, was an ""unforgivable sin."" Obama said that using weapons like that was a red line that couldn't be crossed. In the end, they got really lucky. A diplomatic solution kind of just fell out of the sky, but in a way it didn't really back up the President's threat. What would be wrong with bombing the government buildings in Syria and sending in Green Berets to help train the resistance? It shows the world that when we say ""if you do this, there will be consequences"" and we mean it. Also, we wouldn't be putting our own troops into another war. We bomb them, hit them hard, all from the air. Maybe a plane or two is shot down and maybe a few green berets are lost, but that's their job - to go in to the dangerous places and help those that need it. 

As for Ukraine; once Crimea was gone, why not bomb the gas lines that go from Ukraine to Crimea? It's a strong statement. It says ""Fine, you can have it. But that doesn't mean we have to accept it."" Working with the government in Ukraine, destroying the gas lines into Crimea could be accomplished without hurting anyone. Putin is a bully. He's going to push and push the line as far as he can until someone makes him stop. Anyone that's dealt with bullies before knows they only stop when someone punches them in the teeth. As long as you let them continue to get away with what they're doing, it only encourages them to do it more.

12,Megathread: Fmr. National Security Advisor John Bolton Alleges President Trump Tied Ukraine Funding to Investigation Into Bidens,59120.0,eugha0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eugha0/megathread_fmr_national_security_advisor_john/,9443.0,1580087891.0,"President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton alleges in his forthcoming book that the president explicitly told him ""he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens,"" the New York Times first reported.

The revelations present a dramatic 11th hour turn in Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. They directly contradict Trump’s claim that he never tied the hold-up of Ukrainian aid to his demands for investigations into his political opponent Joe Biden.

In a 51-49 vote, the Senate defeated a push by Democrats to depose former national security adviser John Bolton and other witnesses on their knowledge of the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump’s impeachment.

Two Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah — joined all 47 Senate Democrats in voting for the motion. Two potential GOP swing votes, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, stuck with their party, ensuring Democrats were defeated.

22,Megathread: Lev Parnas States In Interview ‘Trump Knew Exactly What Was Going On’,52039.0,epd4aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/epd4aj/megathread_lev_parnas_states_in_interview_trump/,9246.0,1579143312.0,"Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday, that the president was aware of and involved with his actions connected to a pressure campaign in Ukraine at every step of the way.

Specifically, Parnas and Giuliani were instrumental in Trump's efforts to strong-arm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into publicly committing to investigations that would be beneficial to Trump's reelection campaign.

Parnas and one of Giuliani's other associates, Igor Fruman, were arrested and charged last year with violating campaign-finance laws connected to their work for Giuliani. They pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, and Parnas has since embarked on a media campaign to cooperate with the ongoing impeachment proceedings against the president.

27,Megathread: House Republicans disrupt closed impeachment hearing in protest,51261.0,dm1qbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dm1qbm/megathread_house_republicans_disrupt_closed/,25901.0,1571848030.0,"About 30 House Republicans led by Matt Gaetz, attempted to force entry Wednesday into the closed-door hearing where Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense, is scheduled to testify in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and Ukraine.

The group alleges that they are being shut out of the impeachment process, but there are Republicans on the three panels conducting the investigation — the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees — that are present and able to ask questions at every hearing.

The Republicans walked into the hearing room with their electronics, which is prohibited in the space, known as a SCIF -- a sensitive compartmented information facility -- because it's a secure room used for discussing and handling classified information.

He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on ""the president’s orders,"" confirming Trump’s active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.

In a letter to the Senate Intelligence committee chairs, Trump said he ""no longer"" has the fullest confidence in Atkinson. The letter says the removal will be effective ""30 days from today."" Trump added that he would be submitting a new nominee for the position to the Senate ""at a later date.""

Atkinson first raised concerns about a complaint involving President Trump's communications with Ukraine, which led to the impeachment inquiry.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

Gordon Sondland did not appear for his closed-door meeting with Congress on Tuesday morning, as his attorney Robert Luskin said he had no choice following the White House orders. 

“He is a sitting ambassador and employee of State and is required to follow their direction,” the attorney reportedly said. 

Mr Sondland became enveloped in the president’s impeachment scandal after text messages and a whistleblower complaint revealed he was a witness to allegations against Mr Trump after his July phone call with Ukraine. 

The text messages released by House Democrats show Mr Sondland working with another one of Mr Trump’s envoys to get Ukraine to agree to investigate any potential interference in the 2016 US election and of the energy company that appointed former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter to its board.

The July 26 call between Trump and Gordon Sondland was first described during testimony Wednesday by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor said one of his staffers overhead the call while Sondland was in a restaurant the day after Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that triggered the House impeachment inquiry.

The second diplomatic staffer also at the table was Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv. A person briefed on what Jayanti overheard spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter currently under investigation.

In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose banks accounts.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Expected to testify are William Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

The hearings are scheduled to begin at 10:00 EST.  You can watch live online on  [CSPAN](<https://www.c-span.org/video/?466134-1/impeachment-hearing-william-taylor-george-kent>) or [PBS](<https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-the-trump-impeachment-hearings-day-1>) or most major networks.

---

Reportedly, today's hearing will follow a unique format, and will look/sound a bit different to those of you that are familiar with watching House hearings.

The day will start with opening statements from House Intel Chair Adam Schiff, ranking member Devin Nunes, and both witnesses, William Taylor and George Kent.

Opening statements will be followed by two 45 minute long continuous sessions of questioning. The first will be led by Chair Adam Schiff, followed by Ranking Member Nunes. The unique aspect here is that both the majority and minority will have staff legal counsel present, with counsel expected to present many, if not most, of the questions. Chair Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes are free to interject their own questions (during their respective times) as they wish.

Following the two 45 minute sessions, each member of the Intel Committee will be afforded the standard 5 minute allotment of time for their own questions. The order will alternate between Dem/GOP members.

Today's hearing will conclude with closing statements by Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes, and is expected to come to a close around 4pm EST",politics,Ukraine

Expected to testify are William Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

The hearings are scheduled to begin at 10:00 EST.  You can watch live online on  [CSPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?466134-1/impeachment-hearing-william-taylor-george-kent) or [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-the-trump-impeachment-hearings-day-1) or most major networks.

---

Reportedly, today's hearing will follow a unique format, and will look/sound a bit different to those of you that are familiar with watching House hearings.

The day will start with opening statements from House Intel Chair Adam Schiff, ranking member Devin Nunes, and both witnesses, William Taylor and George Kent.

Opening statements will be followed by two 45 minute long continuous sessions of questioning. The first will be led by Chair Adam Schiff, followed by Ranking Member Nunes. The unique aspect here is that both the majority and minority will have staff legal counsel present, with counsel expected to present many, if not most, of the questions. Chair Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes are free to interject their own questions (during their respective times) as they wish.

Following the two 45 minute sessions, each member of the Intel Committee will be afforded the standard 5 minute allotment of time for their own questions. The order will alternate between Dem/GOP members.

Today's hearing will conclude with closing statements by Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes, and is expected to come to a close around 4pm EST",politics,Ukraine

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, announced on Tuesday that an intelligence community whistleblower who allegedly has information about President Donald Trump’s misconduct in office would like to speak to the committee and has asked the acting director of national intelligence how to do so.

In a [tweet](<https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1176564220407767042>) posted Tuesday, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee is in contact with the whistleblower’s counsel and looks forward to the individual’s testimony.

The whistleblower’s complaint stems from initial allegations that Trump urged the president of Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s potential 2020 opponent, for political purposes.

As of this date, March 3, 2022, Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, in much the same way as I have predicted here and elsewhere.  The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

I originally submitted on December 8, 2021, before Reddit Admins decided to [censor all Russian domains, in response to Putin's invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/t66l5f/reddit_blocked_all_domains_under_russian_cctld_ru/).  Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:

**********
**********

After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",geopolitics,Ukraine

The [current turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/europe/belarus-protests-guide.html) resulted.  As is fairly common in certain Eastern European elections, the 80% margin by which he claimed victory gives rise to obvious doubts as to legitimacy.  Mass protests and demonstrations resulted.  Lukashenko has 'won' past elections by similar margins, at least 85-90%+.  Lukashenko has arrested most of his political opponents, and jailed or exiled others.  Journalists which report on the extent of his corruption (of which there is no shortage) tend to find themselves in prison.  His title as Europe's so called 'last dictator' is well deserved.  

**The Global Response to Lukashenko's Purported Re-Election**

The global response to Lukashenko's purported re-election has been largely as would be anticipated.  Western countries -- and specifically the United States, through Mike Pompeo -- have expressed their reservations.  The results are self evidently suspect.  Despite this, Russia and China both endorsed the results and both countries have officially signaled their endorsement of the results.  Notably, Russia historically has been Belarus's strongest and closest ally, the animosity between Putin and Lukashenko in the recent years notwithstanding.   

**Uncertainty from Russia**

Despite the official endorsement from Putin, uncertainty remains as to the future of Russian and Belarusian bilateral relations.  Several prominent Russians, including those inside Putin's inner circle, have signaled that the Lukashenko's backing from Moscow is not guaranteed.  

Several developments this year contextualize the current status quo.  First, negotiations for discounted oil broke down in totality earlier in February 2020.  Russia not only suspended deliveries to Belarus, but offered future sales at ""[market rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-russia-putin.html)"" on a purely commercial basis.  Second, the oil negotiations broke down after Putin's proposal to merge the two countries was [flatly rejected](https://www.rferl.org/a/day-of-reckoning-as-pressure-mounts-belarusians-balk-at-prospect-of-russia-merger/30309691.html).  Natural gas sales were still discounted somewhat, but the lack of a market rate discount for oil sales to Belarus was a significant blow to the integrity of their relationship. 

The basic idea here is that when global oil prices were high, Russia could with very little significant loss discount its sales to Belarus to gain favor and geopolitical influence.  When oil prices bottomed out -- as they have in recent years -- the costs of that deal to Russia rose, so Russia sought to re-negotiate.  In the past, Lukashenko made few concessions (and in fact used the potential of closer ties with the West to extract that concession from Russia, consistent with his historical maneuvering of the animosity between Russia and NATO to his distinct advantage).  At the very least, Russia wanted closer economic (and by implication, political) integration; potentially, integration to the level of merging the two countries once Lukashenko left office.  Lukashenko predictably rebuked any such proposal. 

**Shrinking Russian Sphere of Influence**

From the outside looking in, it may not make sense why Russia would even want to integrate with Belarus.  All doubt however is resolved in consideration of how the other near and distant dominoes seem to be lining up -- each of them to fall outside the Russian sphere of influence.  Consider Kazakhstan, for example.  Nazarbayev (Kazakh president) has made deliberate efforts to broaden its economic and cultural reach outside the sphere of Russian influence, even to the point that he changed [the Kazakh alphabet](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41800186) from Cyrillic to Latin in 2017.   The idea was to draw a line in the sand relative to the scope and extent of Russian influence in Central Asia in general and Kazakhstan in particular. 

The fact that Russia hemorrhaged allied states following the USSR's collapse is a matter of historical record.  Thirteen Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO.  So, when Georgia endeavored to join the EU in 2007, Putin invaded Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- both of which remain allegedly ""disputed"" territories to this day.   A [highly deceptive](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/HUDOC_38263_08_Annexes_ENG.pdf) analysis concluded Georgia was to blame; but the whole reason Russia invaded in the first place was because Georgia was actively seeking NATO membership -- of course, to prevent exactly such an invasion.  In reality, Russia invaded a sovereign country for the purpose of preventing it from joining NATO.  Putin's response shows that in Russia's analysis, Georgia is better as a fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

A similar pattern played out in Ukraine.  As I have discussed before, when Ukraine sought closer economic and political integration with Western Europe and the United States, that was met with Russian meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics, even to the point of installing Yanukovych as Russia's puppet Ukrainian president.  Thereafter, in the face of maidan, Putin invaded eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea.  In the example of Ukraine as in Georgia, the outcome shows that Russia would prefer that Ukraine be a failed or fragmented state than a NATO ally or EU member.  

Recall that the goal here was for Putin to create an economic alliance in at least Eastern Europe and Central Asia to rival the EU, and ideally as an insurance policy against further sanctions.  The first step in that process would be developing individualized economic integration projects among each of the former Soviet bloc states.  Instead, Putin lost Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine in the span of less than a decade.  Ukraine was the first such integration project -- and that resulted in then-president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych's absconding Ukraine for Russia in disgrace. 

**So is Belarus next?**

Perhaps.  It's a question worth asking; especially considering what ""being next"" could mean.  

In a first set of possible worlds, Lukashenko is out because of his own decisions, or because he is forced out (potentially by the protesters, Russia or both).  In 2018-2019, when Russian-Belarusian bilateral relations were at their worst, it's conceivable that Putin might have tried something like he achieved in Ukraine -- but highly unlikely.  

It isn't obvious that Putin would be unwilling invade, given in particular the fact that he invaded Georgia and Ukraine under somewhat similar circumstances and that at this moment Lukashenko is very weak.  Lukashenko has never faced mass protests/demonstrations of this caliber before.  Putin has, and he survived them, but the public's dissatisfaction with Lukashenko's ""leadership"" is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, the consequential economic fallout attributable to the world's response to the coronavirus, and an increasingly ravenous lion to the east in its once-closer ally Russia.  

This combination of factors certainly suggests that if Moscow sees the opportunity to try to replace Lukashenko with someone more reliable to the Kremlin, that is exactly what the Kremlin would try to accomplish.   In that situation, Moscow would be re-running the same play-book it ran to get Yanukovych elected as president of Ukraine.  Even if such a far-fetched plan were to work -- and it almost certainly would not, in the short term or the long term -- who would take Lukashenko's place?  There is no one that would not leave Moscow worse off than they would be with Lukashenko.  While it's obvious why he's not ideal, given the recent history of strife between the two countries, there is no world where Russia's interests are -- at this time -- served by trying to replace Lukashenko with a Kremlin puppet.  

In the second set of possible worlds, Lukashenko remains and has to quell or pacify the Belarusian political unrest while maintaining ground against increasing Russian pressure.  To accomplish this, Lukashenko could do something like seek a trade deal with the EU, as both Georgia and Ukraine did.  But that would almost certainly would involve some kind of military response from Russia, just like Georgia and then Ukraine.  While there's an argument to be made that Lukashenko's historically closer relationship with Russia (however complicated) insulates him from the kind of retaliation Putin visited upon Georgia and Ukraine, he would still be playing with fire.  The Russian response to that kind of a bargaining chip from Russia would likely not come in the form of unwillingness to discount oil; it would come in the same form as was witnessed in Eastern Ukraine.  To be clear, neither Putin nor Lukashenko benefit in that case.  

The remaining option is most likely:  Lukashenko ""cracks down"" on the protests, and then everything goes back to normal.  

**Why Belarus is Different from Ukraine & Georgia**

As I wrote before, Belarus is not Ukraine.  Maidan in Ukraine was in direct response to Ukrainian government's preventing Ukraine from joining the EU.  The Ukrainian government opted for a counter-agreement with Russia instead.  In response, Ukrainians took to the streets and sought Yanukovych's resignation.  He subsequently fled to Russia.  There were other abuses that precipitated the demonstrations, like Yanukovych arresting his pro-democracy political opponents and arresting journalists who were reporting on the extent of his corruption, but the threshold moment was when Yanukovych tried to rebuke the democratic will of the Ukrainian people (shirk the EU in favor of the Kremlin).  So, for Ukraine, the goal was a clear and decisive move towards the EU and the United States (and NATO, by implication).  This was in response to decades of Kremlin meddling in Ukrainian domestic political affairs.  Maidan there was Ukraine setting forth a future for itself that did not include Putin.  

Belarus also isn't Georgia.  The purported underlying ethnic conflict behind the Russian invasion of Georgia was little more than an illusory pretext; Saakashvili's primary aim for Georgia was to become a NATO member and there was clear support for that in the Bush Administration because of the implications that would have to world oil markets.  Specifically, despite the fact that Georgia has no reserves of its own, a pipeline across Georgia would substantially decrease Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  Bush even outlined a pathway for both Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.  This was intolerable to Putin, and so he invaded as a result.  

Belarus and its present situation is almost wholly incongruous.  Belarus is now and has always been a far more authoritarian regime than Ukraine ever was, even at its worst.  Unlike Ukraine and Georgia, Belarus never made the initial step towards actual democracy that ultimately laid the foundation the Ukrainian maidan or the Georgian efforts to draw closer to the West.  Belarus also does not have ambitions of closer ties with the West, and the EU and Untied States in particular -- which Ukraine has sought for some time.  Lukashenko only ever used that as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from Moscow -- a fact of which Putin is invariably aware.  The riots taking place now in Belarus are not oriented towards any goal in particular, either.  It's arbitrary rage.  Even if they were oriented towards democratic reform, and it is not clear that they are, Belarus has no intention of divesting itself from the Russian sphere of influence -- however high the costs of maintaining that relationship may be.  

**Compromise / Cooperation best serve both Belarus's & Russia's Interests** 

If both Belarus and Russia act rationally, they will cooperate and compromise.  Russia will have little choice but to accept the fact that Belarus is not merging with Russia any time soon.  The costs of Russia's invading would be inexorably high.  There is no one in Belarusian politics that can replace Lukashenko that would be both able to preserve Belarus as a state and that would in the same instance be able to more effectively advance Moscow's interests.  Likewise, it is in Russia's interest that these riots and protests throughout Belarus come to and end -- as quickly and expeditiously as possible.  Political unrest in one totalitarian country has a tendency to spread to another; as Putin has experienced time and again, dating back to his time in Dresden through the present.  Further, this all comes at a time when Russian public confidence in Putin is at an all time low -- and the potential for another Moscow maidan (and perhaps one that might actually be successful) is at an all time high.  Given that, the more pertinent question in the final analysis might even be, if Lukashenko falls, is Putin next?  Their fates are tied together, whether they like it or not.",geopolitics,Ukraine

Troop movements can be considered rather normal, but having propaganda being broadcasted and lavrov being extremely aggressive and threatening surprised me a little bit.  That looks like a rather holistic move.

Russia and Ukraine are building up their forces near the conflict zone. The question is, why? This analysis will try to go into some of the potential end game scenarios and explain why it is happening. The reader should not take this article for anything else than an analysis from a hobby enthusiast.*

**The show of force**

The most likely reason seen is Russia trying to muscle itself in front of Kyiv and Washington. Many experts say the recent Russian military movement does not comprise sufficient force for a conventional Ukraine invasion. With Russia's military posturing, it appears to be primarily coercive and demonstrative in nature as of now.

This argument is backed up by the fact that Russia's Western Military District has, per April 3, not mobilised key regiments and divisions that would likely be necessary to support an offensive against Ukraine. Moreover, Russia has also not built up the required logistical depots — including fuel, ammunition, and medical supplies — for a major offensive. Although there might infrastructure left from the many skirmishes and threats of escalation the last seven years, it is less likely western and Ukrainian intelligence would not have picked it up.

The third point is the lack of stealth and subtlety in the military build-up. If an offensive were the primary goal, the Russian military would not have openly telegraphed ongoing deployments, according to Mason Clark, lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. \*\* On Telegram, Twitter and other Social Media, there are many pictures and videos of the troop deployment that makes it easy to follow the movement.

The timing has also been an argument against an invasion. Right now Ukraine and Russia are at that time of the year called Rasputitsa. The time where travelling on unpaved roads or across the country is difficult and definitely be a disadvantage for an attacking force. 

**The Peacekeepers**

The second reason that might explain Russia's action if preparing for a military campaign is to get Russian ""peacekeepers"" in the Donbas region. Russia has denied and official military forces inside the area, blaming all Russian casualties or prisoners as voluntary soldiers without Moscow's orders. A triggering event, either natural or fake, can provide Russia with the Casus Belli to move into Donbas after an ""invitation"" of the local government in the pretence of protecting Russian citizens.

It would have the merit of preserving existing territorial arrangements, at least outwardly, yet it would allow for the revival of military operations at any moment required by Moscow. Moreover, it is the one military option that fits observable evidence: the movement of forces from Russia and local reserves' mobilisation.\*\*\*

**The (water) invasion**

The least likely option, but not impossible, is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, of all the analysts found, no one saw this as the main reason for the Russian forces' escalation in the region. Often the Crimea Water crisis is an argument as a reason for war.\*\*\*\*

A forced takeover action of the canal from the Russian military should be considered a last resort, given that the cost of such an operation for Russia would significantly exceed the possible benefit in almost any category.

To try would mean it would be necessary to capture more than 70 km of Ukrainian territory up to the left bank of the Kakhovka reservoir, which would meet strong resistance from a different Ukrainian military that was in 2014 and also entail new sanctions.

Simultaneously, the decommissioned canal has deteriorated in the last seven years, and without a significant overhaul, Russia would lose most of the water during transmission. The canal will also serve as a high-risk target for sabotage from the Ukrainian military, demanding many resources to protect it.

An invasion in this degree would be based on more goals or motivation than just water for Crimea.

*So what is the reason for this escalation?*

**Testing a new President**

When Trump took over the Presidency in 2017, there was a celebration in the Kremlin. However, the party soon ended as both sanctions, and the distance between Washington and Moscow continued. In some ways, the pressure on Russia increased. Trumps administration sent and approved the use of the Javelin missiles for frontline duty. A much welcome weapon to combat Russian tanks for the Ukrainian military, although not a gamechanger. \*\*\*\*\*\*

Biden presidency has early shown its support to Ukraine, and the recent escalation might be to see how far the new administration is willing to go. Putin might hope that Biden is a continuation of the Obama presidency, a man that Putin did not take seriously. However, the Russian President might be disappointed. Biden history in US politics goes back to the 70s, and he has experience both with Putin's Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union.

**Stopping a new Zelensky**

Something happened with the Ukrainian President in 2021. First, he stopped three pro-Russian tv channels from the air, and then sanctions hit the country's oligarchs, even the owner of the tv channel that made Zelensky famous, Ihor Kolomoyskyi. These events could be seen as a domestic issue, supported by the US to approve his falling approval ratings. Then the real bombshell hit. On February 19, Viktor Medvedchuk was put on the Ukrainian sanctions list due to the financing of terrorism.

Medvedchuk has been named Putin's man in Ukraine, and the Russian President is also the godfather of Medvedchuks, daughter. A man who has always been in the centre of Ukrainian politics and who always have promoted Russian interest. The sanctions made him powerless in the country. Zelensky could not have made such a move without guarantees from an ally more powerful than national oligarchs and Russia. The fact is that within two months, Ukraine has taken down a pro-Russia propaganda network that took years to build up. It must have been a surprise for both Medvedchuck and the Kremlin to see him being played out on the sidelines so quickly.

**The Nagorno ghost**

The war in Nagorno Karabakh might have ushered us into a new age of warfare, the age of drones. The conflict, where Armenia was supported by Russian arms and Azerbaijan by Turkish, was almost a walkover for the Azerbaijani forces. Turkish drones destroyed Russian bought tanks and armour.

Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones became overnight a weapon in demand, and one of the first buyers was Kyiv, who already have managed to put 6 of them in use. A joint venture between Ankara and Kyiv has also been made Russia's headache, which now must use more resources to research and incorporate drone warfare into its armed forces. The JV is seen as a win-win situation as Ukraine establish a new market and military capabilities, while Turkey might avoid western arms sanctions.§

However, it is to be noted that, like the Javelins, the drone programme is not a game-changer. Still, it puts another weapon in Ukraine's arsenal that again demands more resources to counter. In that sense, it is not surprising to see that the Russian is transporting the S-300 missile or other SAM system near Ukraine. This system might be permanently positioned in Donbas, as evidence suggests that drone use has been a severe problem to the separatists on the front line. In a simple sentence, after seven years, Ukraine has found an area of warfare where Russia lags.

All countries bordering Russia, except China, strategies a war with Russia on the following equation: How much damage can we inflict before Russia sees it as not worth it. The best window for Russia was in 2014.

Although Ukraine is still heavily shorthanded, especially the navy, no one can argue against the progress made. Russia will win if this is one to one conflict, but the costs will most likely be high; many believe it's too high.

First is the idea that Russia is a declining power whose aggression towards its neighbors is borne of weakness, not strength. It is a defensive power with great strategic depth, but is riddled with weak demographics, a moribund economy, crippling and systemic corruption, an outdated military, and woeful social indicators from alcoholism to suicide to life expectancy. Its GDP is now 8% of the U.S. and 12% of China's (by far the biggest gap in more than a century). It is falling rapidly in the economic totem pole and peak oil will be its deathknell.

Second is the idea that Russia is a rising power whose tactical acumen on the world stage places it firmly in the space of the great powers. It is one of the Top 4 ""pillars"" of the geopolitical structure - along with China, the European Union and the United States, and their ties to the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America give them a major strategic advantage. Their frozen conflict inroads into Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova,  and their big stick diplomacy against Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, etc. are proof of Russia's growing might. They can outmaneuver both the EU and USA with ease and have manager the enviable feat of subverting Western democracy and institutions at pennies on the dollar.

My ""sources"" are a mixture of lectures from both [Polish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3xu1zimPVw&t=2s) and [foreign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7AgYqoaNs) observers of the subject, various [think tank events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dckWnhSO-EA) and [reports](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html), [articles from more specialized media](https://www.defence24.com/geopolitics/), as well as my own understanding of situation in a broader historical context, my own attempts to read between the lines of what the relevant world leaders are saying as well my perception of the mood in the country sampled from ""the word on the street"".  
If that seems insufficient to you, please keep in mind that my aim is not to bring you any shocking revelations and trend-setting conclusions. I merely wish to present to you the various ways in which more or less geopolitically-conscious Poles think and talk about the present and future of their country. So without further ado, let's begin:  

**The Stage**  

Poland is in its current shape and geographic location strategically indefensible and its geopolitical position independently untenable. With no significant natural barriers in either direction, in her 1000 years of history, independent Poland has never existed for long with greater powers to both West and East. That said, it's important to state that as tragic as the country's flat and indefensible geography is, the part of the Northern European Plain it's situated on is also the narrowest in the North-South direction and along with Ukraine constitutes a gateway between East and West. When Poland controlled most of those lands, her curse was also her blessing and contributed in a major way to Commonwealth's status as a great power. Poland lacking control of the entireity of this gate reaps none of the benefits of having a say who comes through and faces all of the threat of being in the way.  
Poland's current sovereignty can be attributed almost entirely to a ""freeze"" in great power politics brought on by the establishment of the so called ""Rules-Based Global Order"" introduced by the United States following World War 2 in order to bring the Western states together to help America stand against the Soviets.  
After the collapse of the USSR, a decision was made to maintain said order and invite Poland, along with other countries liberated from the Communists who were ready to take that offer, to the club, resulting in Poland joining NATO in 1997 and the EU in 2004. This, along with drastic and arguably haphazard, but comprehensive liberalization reforms carried out in the early 90s, resulted in steady growth of prosperity, culminating in Poland officially joining the ranks of developed countries in 2018.  

**The Predicament**  

Given Poland's unfortunate geography and relatively small population and economy, it can never realistically hope to stand against hostile foreign incursions of both hard and soft power without outside help. That makes it so that what Poland needs above all is a powerful and reliable ally with a vested interest in Poland existing as an independent state. This notion is as obvious today as it was in the inter-war period, but just as back then the allies proved not rich enough in the above qualities to keep Poland from Stalin, the fear is that should the Global Rules-Based Order unravel further, the same will prove to be true once again.  
Of course, great many people in Poland are free from that fear, trusting in lasting endurance of NATO as deterrence to outside threats and the EU continuing to be a stable environment for Poland to thrive in and increase her prosperity and it's entirely possible that they may prove to be correct, but we're not here to look at the world from a perspective in which geopolitical realities are assumed to be put on hold indefinitely.  

**The Dangers**  

The more things change the more they stay the same, the mortal threats to Polish sovereignty remain Russia and Germany. I'll start with Germany as that's the part that already raised more eyebrows and objections and I need to quickly clarify that educated, reasonable Poles on the most part don't consider Germany to be hostile to Poland or believe that it will turn hostile in the future. The threat I am talking about pertains to the sovereignty of Poland, not to Polish lives and basic individual freedoms and the loss of said sovereignty is to happen through further gradual osmosis of German soft power into its weaker neighbour, accelerated by further institutional integration within the EU (especially if conditions of this integration would be unfavourable to Poland), not armed conflict of any kind.  
A large segment of Polish society, what could be roughly described as ""liberals"", considers that outcome to be acceptable if not desirable. Some believe that by the time it happens, we will all be a one big European family and it won't matter who's stronger than who, some concede that it's the only option and it will happen no matter what, so there's no point fighting it and some even believe that being de facto governed by German politicians is prefereable to living under a Polish government. The ""conservatives"" largely see the threat of German domination as one of the main arguments against further European integration, but it's important to note that Poland still remains the most pro-EU country in Europe. I'll come back to that topic later.  

Now let's discuss Russia. Poles view Russia most unfavourably out of any nation in the world and there is virtually no diplomatic dialogue between the two countries. When you say ""foreign threat"" in Poland, you're saying ""Russia"", when Polish army trains, it trains against Russia, when Polish MOD buys equipment, people will judge the purchase based on how they think it will fare against what the Russians have. Polish politicians have to bite their tongue not to call Russia ""enemy"" when speaking publicly and the guy who tried to start a pro-Russian political party ended up locked in jail, because he was found out to be an agent.  
The reason for that is that everyone barring a handful of fringe political groups, especially from the extreme right, recognizes that Polish and Russian interest in the region are fundamentally irreconcilable, the same as they ever were.  
Other than the need for good allies, what is also universally recognized in Poland is that the country would greatly benefit economically and strategically from being neighboured by friendly, like-minded countries to the East. **Continued independence of the Baltics as well as integration of Ukraine and hopefully Belarus into the political and economic sphere where Poland resides are vital geopolitical interests of Poland.** Securing these latter two goals would push the Russian threat further away (I don't want to use the term ""buffer zone"", since that term has very negative connotations when applied to this part of the world due to what Russians understand by it), make Poland less periferial in this community of nations and preferably allow it to extert the same kind of influence that Germany exterts on Poland.  
Russia has obviously other plans for the region and I have to leave it at that, because explaining the point of view of Russia is a monumental task that goes far beyond the scope of this post.  
Now an important question is what geopolitically-literate persons in Poland exactly fear from Russia. Few consider an outright invasion of Poland to be a real possibility in circumstances remotely resembling the ones we have today, although it's important to note that according to most analysts and recently conducted war games, from a purely-strategic point of view and based on concentration of troops in the region, Russia is perfectly capable of swiftly beating Polish forces and forcing them to retreat beyond Vistula assuming access through Belarus.  
A more realistic scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the aforementioned countries of interest forcing Poland to either react and risk potentially even nuclear retaliation or concede to being encroached on by a threat that could one day turn existential.  
A specific and the most relevant example of such a scenario is a Russian incursion into one of the Baltic states. Assuming Belarussian neutrality (which is the better option for Poland), the aid provided to the Baltics would need to come through the Suwałki gap (the strip of land where Poland borders Lithuania) which is not possible due to the concentration of the area-denial missile systems in the exclave of Kaliningrad. To open the passage, those area-denial system must first be destroyed. So **in order to protect her vital geostrategic interests, Poland would need to get a go-ahead from her more powerful Western allies (i.e. United States) to attack Russian territory, destroy crucial Russian assets and risk starting a nuclear war.** Or go at it alone and get smacked down by Russia eventually. Nobody assumes that Poland has the green light to provoke a nuclear war, so that's a serious headache. And it gets worse.  

**The Future**  
*or riding two horses into the storm*   

As bad as being expected by your stronger allies to be the first to confront a greater threat without knowing how much political will to support you if you do there is, it gets worse without them. With increasing talks of a) EU wishing to become independent from US militarily b) American leadership reconsidering its commitments to Europe and shifting its attention towards Asia and (I don't want to make this political in the internal sense, but it would be dishonest not to mention it) c) Polish government's universally condemned transgressions against the system of democratic checks and balances weakening Poland's claim of entitlement to protection by the Rules-Based Order by default, Poland might soon face a situation where failing to secure firm commitment from one of her allies will leave her with none. Which one of those allies should Poland stake her chips on is the essence of the geopolitical debate in Poland and that's regardless of whether the participants realize that what they're talking about is geopolitics or not. If you exclude the fringe, and in my personal view, ignorant propositions that Poland should either stand alone against the world or cozy up to Russia (A sidenote: there is an intriguing notion that Russia might be willing to extend a very sweet deal to Poland to secure our non-interference in the next Russian adventure, but if such a thing was to happen, it would be because Poland is a problem for Russia, not because they like us, so that's not an argument for being pro-Russian before that happens), what we're left with are two directions, doctrines or options:  

**The Atlantic Option**  

Proponents of the Atlantic Option will tell you that Poland is a prime candidate to serve as a continental anchor for the atlantic sea powers of United Kingdom and United States and it's reasonable to expect those countries to be interested in keeping us an ally. The idea is that Americans and the British have a use for Poland as a form of a wedge between Germany and Russia keeping those countries from consolidating into something that could threaten them.  
Its opponents will tell you that Poland is on the wrong side of the Jutland peninsula to be the continental anchor and that turning our back on EU and clinging onto Americans for dear life like we currently do without even knowing if they will care about what happens in Europe is misguided. Whether the latter will prove to be true or not, the apparent pros of this option are enticing. For one, US being the (increasingly doubted, but still reigning) military hegemon and being too far to extert the kind of dominating influence a neighbour could, is the perfect ally for Poland assuming their commitment. And Americans, whether they mean it or not, assure us of their commitment at every occasion, so for as many things as you can fault our government, not being eager to mistrust them is not one of them. Secondly, to serve as this wedge, Poland would need to be in a decent shape not only militarily, but also economically and being economically propped-up by the largest economy on the planet (in nominal GDP, I know) is again a mouth-watering perspective. Finally a firm alliance with America would likely imply encouragement and support for Poland to extend its influence to the the countries of interests I mentioned earlier in order to incorporate them into the wedge, whereas European states could just easily have them for themselves.  
As for the cons, other than the lack of certainty of reciprocity, they are as follows:  
- being America's great landing strip would put us in greater danger than a humble existence within EU would  
- many people strongly favour European values and the institutions that foster them over American flavour of freedom with its for-profit prisons and things of this sort  
- turning our back completely on EU if we were ever forced to could be economically suicidal to the point where even the mighty US couldn't subsidize us out of poverty given how deeply Polish economy is integrated with the EU, especially Germany  

For now, despite the threat of United States turning its attention entirely to Asia (or even, God forbid, sacrificing us to Russia for their aid there), electing an islolationist president or an idealist president who deems alliance with Poland not worth tolerating our leaders' encroachment on democratic values, or even the possibility that when things get too tense, the Americans will reveal that they never cared that much to begin with, we put our faith in the Atlantic Option. That's a long list of cons and despites, which is understandable why many people prefer

**The Continental Option**  

The Continental Option stakes Poland's security on firm integration with the EU. Its proponents believe that just as good EU was for us economically as an economic union, it will be good for us militarily as a military union. They reasonably posit that Poland, being a country with a major interest in security matters, should jump at Macron's invitation to form a EU army and place their allegiance there instead of USA in matters like military equipment procurement and the choice of foreign expeditions, eventually even aiding in going against the interests of the United States should that ever happen to be good for Europe. They believe that a deeply united Europe would be a formidable force that nobody would dare confront and that a membership in this organization is more than enough to keep Poland safe. The problems with this approach vary from obvious, like the fact that no European country has currently any real capability to project significant force into Poland or the fact that major European powers don't share the same attitude to Russia as we do (see: Nord Stream 2), to very controversial like potentially questionable long term viability and stability of the union itself. The last problem, which I hinted at before, is the notion that even if things go splendidly in terms of ensuring Poland's security, integrating our armed forced into a structure that's in large part controlled by states which may not have our best interests in mind in matters less drastic than foreign incursions will result in finalizing the de facto loss of sovereignty that a deep integration into the EU entails. As many potential flaws as there are with this deal, it seems to be the one that is more likely to remain on the table should our worries about the direction the world is going were to materialize.  

**Conclusion**

As you can see, given that both options are, however much needed, far from perfect and in a nightmare scenario it's possible that neither will be avaliable or sufficiently realized when needed, if Poland is ever forced to choose (and we're not here to proclaim The End of History and state that it never will), it's reasonable to expect that things will never be as good as they are now that we have the luxury of enjoying all the military and economic boons that a one, amicable community of nations has to offer us.  
It's important to note that both sides of the debate have arguments with merit and it's near-impossible to objectively attribute the correct amount of weight to them without countless preconceptions and biases getting in the way. **It's a difficult and important debate and its outcome could determine not only the fate of countries that along with Poland would need to radically reconsider how they see their security situation, but even significantly influence the nature of the future relationship between United States and European Union.**

Russia has been claiming NATO is an offensive military against Russia and that Russia must buy these advanced weapons now.

But is this really? First off, Russia even with the fall of the Soviet Union, is a nuclear weapons state with thousands of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. Even a limited American incursion such as seizing Kalinigrad or Crimea could be met with hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons on NATO forces. Sure America has the more advanced weapons and may ""win"" as in come out on top in a non-city nuclear exchange, but why would America risk it? Historically, empires expand when they are desperate. The Romans needed loot and land to make up for farmland plundered by Hannibal, the British needed carve up the world as a a sea-power to compete with larger European land economic powers. The Nazis needed to expand into the Soviet Union for security, living space, oil and food. But the United States has no reason to attack Russia, it has the food, tech, oil, security, minerals, it won't risk even a conventional war against a foe like North Korea and Iran unless they were attacked first. Even in a conventional fight, where Russia held off nukes, Russia could tens of thousands of American troops, a war started by the US simply isn't worth it.

So why is this concern really? Historically, Russia has had a bad history of liberalization under the Yeltsin administration, where individuals were corrupt and the nation was starving. In comes Putin, coming up with reforms of controlling the Oligarchs and winning a victory in Chechyna against Islamic sepratists. Putin and George Bush got along at first, but concerns of American withdraw of ABM Treaty along with the US invasion of Middle Eastern states, gave Russia the feeling that US was pushing around its weight and reinforcing a cultural hegemony that could decide world affairs and break apart Russian economic partners. Combined with the Orange Revolution and the Euromaiden, Putin fears that these liberal revolts will spark one in Russia where the Putin regime would be overthrown.

So why the hate for NATO? Well NATO has had a history of increasingly expanding. Poland is known to be one of the members that angered Russia. Poland's economy saw rapid rise, and they could keep their military spending effective for they buy arms for the United States(cheaper). That means more money can be invested in the economy. This could happen to other Eastern European states as well such as Ukraine and Greece increasingly buying Western arms. Combined with the volumes of investment along with sanctions, Russia fears that the Eastern states will spread propaganda of ""the West is so much better than Nationalism, look at all this cool stuff I bought"", which could lead to a ""colored revolution of Russia"" which will lead to the deposition of the Putin regime.

Under this line of thinking, Russia ""won"" because (1) it showed how weak Ukraine was, (2) Russia was able to annex Crimea (the ""Taiwan of Russia"" since it was gifted to Ukraine by ~~Stalin~~ \[EDIT: Krushchev\] in 1954), and (3) it turned Ukraine into a frozen conflict with the Donbass, making it extremely unlikely it would ever be able to join the European Union or NATO.

But is this the correct take? It seems to me like Ukraine was a massive success for the West for a few reasons:

(1) Ukraine pre-Euromaidan was a 50-50 battleground between pro-West and pro-Russia. Russia's reaction, therefore, to annex Crimea and to sever the Donbass was short-sighted because (a) they took the most pro-Russia slices out of Ukraine (equivalent to the GOP losing Florida or Texas in the electoral college) and (b) they shifted a lot of soft pro-Russia support in the East of Ukraine against Russia.

The current geopolitical reality is that Yanukovich is likely the most pro-Russian leader that Ukraine will have for some time.

In a sense, Russia annexing Crimea was a pyrrhic victory, since it's hard for the pro-Russian coalition in Ukraine to take power having lost their base regions. The demographics aren't there any more.

(2) As a result of #1, Ukraine is now firmly Western-oriented. The long-running tug of war that long defined Ukraine between pro-Russia/pro-West has been replaced by a Kyiv Consensus, if you will.

Ukrainian politics now revolves around how pro-Western should the country be. The last election between Poroshenko and Zelensky highlights this new paradigm, with Western Ukraine (centered on Lviv) heavily and messianically anti-Russia (as always) and the Eastern parts (east of the Dnieper) now also anti-Russia, but of a more pragmatic flavor. Yuriy Boyko (the 2019 leader of the pro-Russia camp) was only able to secure wins in the rump Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts still under Ukrainian control, and only secured 12% of the vote, no longer enough to make it to the second round as the pro-Russia camp could previously do.

The end result of all this is simple: the Government in Kyiv is now anti-Russian. People focus on the 10% of Ukraine that the West ""lost"" but don't realize the 90% of Ukraine that the West ""won.""

If you told Western diplomats a decado ago whether they'd trade Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to the Russian sphere for a strongly pro-Western political class governing everywhere else, it'd be considered the bargain of the century.

Ukraine was essentially carved in 2014 with Russia getting 5 million and the West getting 38 million. That's a massive imbalance.

(3) As a result of #2, the West no longer has to play footsie with Kyiv, worrying that they cannot enter into meaningful integration because Ukraine might swing pro-Russia at the next election. Since 2014, cooperation between the West and Ukraine has massively increased, not just in terms of military aid, but political reform technical assistance, economic links, and booming trade ties. Some businessmen in the West are now eyeing Ukraine as the new frontier, as Poland and Romania's economic prosperity has made them more expensive bases for low-value manufacturing.

I could easily see Ukraine now becoming a foundry and a breadbasket for Europe. The end effect of course being that a Ukraine that is more enmeshed in the Western alliance is now more valuable given its value as part of the EU's supply chain. And a feedback loop is taking place. A parallel would be Taiwan, which long sought to become a supply chain link with the West that would enhance its military security by making it indispensable as part of the Western supply chain (see how much TSMC and semiconductors now factors into Washington's calculus about ""losing"" Taiwan).

""The received wisdom is that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has breathed new life, and a new sense of purpose, urgency and unity into nato. Someone forgot to tell Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Over the past month the Turkish president has blocked nato enlargement, warned of a new offensive against American-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria and stoked tensions with Greece, also a member of the alliance. A few pundits, in the West but also in Turkey, are once again debating whether nato and Turkey should part ways. This time, they are not alone. “Leaving nato should be put on the agenda as an alternative,” Devlet Bahceli, leader of a nationalist party in Mr Erdogan’s coalition, recently said. “We did not exist because of nato and we will not perish without nato.”

Frustration is also mounting in Western capitals, and in Kyiv, over Turkey’s willingness to accommodate Russia. Many in those places had hoped that the war in Ukraine would force Mr Erdogan to reconsider his romance with Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Opportunism has prevailed instead. Turkey has sold armed drones to Ukraine and closed access to the Black Sea for Russian warships, but it opposes Western sanctions against Russia and openly courts Russian capital. According to a report in the Turkish media, dozens of Russian companies, including Gazprom, are planning to move their European headquarters to Turkey.

Aside from a few words of condemnation at the start of the war in Ukraine, Turkey has remained on good terms with Russia throughout. When Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, visited Ankara this month his Turkish counterpart kindly suggested that the West should ease sanctions against Russia if Russia relaxed its blockade of Ukrainian ports. When Mr Lavrov repeated his claim that Russia had invaded Ukraine to liberate it from neo-Nazis, his host said nothing.

Mr Erdogan’s move to block Sweden’s and Finland’s accession to nato has further damaged Turkey’s standing in the alliance. The strongman has signalled that he wants the Nordic countries to extradite several members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (pkk), an outlawed armed group, and to drop a partial arms embargo against his country. He may also be shopping for concessions from America in exchange for withdrawing his veto, or from Russia for doing the opposite. Mr Erdogan occasionally sounds hostile to nato enlargement as a matter of principle. In a recent guest column for *The Economist*, he went as far as to blame Finland and Sweden for adding an “unnecessary item” to nato’s agenda by asking to join the alliance.

Mr Erdogan may have reasoned that a couple of foreign crises were needed to distract Turkish voters from their fast-diminishing circumstances, as galloping inflation, officially measured at over 70%, devours their savings and wages. In late May he warned of a new military offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria. Forced to shelve such plans, presumably because of opposition from Russia or America or both, he has since lashed out against Greece, demanding that it demilitarise Greek islands hugging Turkey’s western coast. He has also suggested that American bases in Greece pose a threat to Turkey (which hosts American forces itself). This might be bluster, and blow over. But obstructing Finland’s and Sweden’s nato membership while war rages in Europe is bound to have consequences, even if Mr Erdogan backs down. Sweden had been one of the few countries keeping alive Turkey’s hopes of membership in the European Union. That support has now gone.

That may seem a price worth paying to Mr Erdogan if the row fires up his nationalist base. Mainstream Turkish politicians, as well as many humbler Turks, see the pkk purely as a security threat, and have long criticised the West for not taking their concerns about the group seriously. They have bristled especially at America’s decision to team up with the group’s Syrian wing to bring down Islamic State’s caliphate. Westerners, meanwhile, tend to believe that Turkey bears much of the blame for the pkk’s emergence by refusing to grant the country’s Kurds the rights they demand. They have also concluded that Mr Erdogan cannot be trusted to decide who is or is not a terrorist. By applying the label to thousands of people, including bureaucrats, academics, peaceful protesters and Kurdish politicians, and often throwing them into the same prisons as armed militants, Mr Erdogan has cheapened the term as badly as he has Turkey’s currency.

Turkey and the West will never see eye to eye on the issue, and Mr Erdogan’s antics, as well as his habit of suggesting that the West, and not Russia, is the biggest threat to his country, will only make matters worse. Already, 65% of Turks say they do not trust nato, according to a recent survey, although 60% support membership of the alliance.

## Never say never

None of this spells doom for the relationship between Turkey and nato. Western countries will try to work round Turkey’s veto by providing Finland and Sweden with security guarantees. This may leave Turkey sidelined within the alliance. But its departure or eviction from nato is still fantasy. Turkey is on the front line of the war in Syria and close to other conflicts in the Middle East; it controls access to the Black Sea, which has been central to all of Russia’s recent wars; and it serves as a corridor for trade between Central Asia and Europe, especially in energy, notes Ben Hodges, a former commander of American forces in Europe. “I don’t even want to think of nato without Turkey,” he says.

Especially in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Turkey also has no interest in surrendering the power of deterrence that nato membership offers. “I don’t believe it will ever happen,” says Tacan Ildem, Turkey’s former permanent representative to nato. There is no credible alternative, he says. Turkey will probably remain a headache for the alliance, even when Mr Erdogan is out of the picture. But it is a headache nato will have to live with.""",geopolitics,Ukraine

This article will go into deep on what happened the last year, how the drone might change the conflict in Donbas and what we can expect in an era of new warfare. The article is written by a hobby enthusiast on the subject and should be treated as such.*

*UPDATED; 12 hours after this article was published Ukraine (if the source is to be trusted) confirmed that its Bayraktar is officially used in the frontline.*  

*Yuriy Misyagin, the Deputy Chairman of* [*#Ukraine*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hashtag_click)*’s Defence and Intelligence Committee:  “Bayraktar TB2 Armed UAVs made their first flights over the Donbas area and detected the locations of Pantsir-S1, S-125 and Tor anti-aircraft missile systems.”*

**Background**

February 2020. The Covid virus is just starting to get the attention it demands globally, but the headlines are in Ankara. The Turkish President has just ordered an offensive into Syria or, more specific, operation Spring Shield. \*

Just days before, many Turkish soldiers, from 36-100 depending on the source, lost their lives when the Syrian Air Force and allegedly the Russian Air force conducted airstrikes against Turkish Army positions. The following operation might just have changed warfare forever.

After five days the Russian President Vladimir Putin and Erdogan meet in Moscow, where a ceasefire was signed, but what happened in those five days?

The answer was a massacre. Turkey used for the first time its arsenal of drones that took Russian and Syrian countermeasures barehanded. Video footage showed them destroying one Syrian armoured vehicle after another, including more than 100 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and air defence systems. Reportedly dozens of Turkish ANKA-S and Bayraktar-TB2 drones attacked government targets and destroyed several Russian-made air defence systems. Hundreds of Syrian government soldiers were killed, and Turkey had pushed deep into the Syrian front in only six days; drones were seen as an apparent substitute for manned air-fighters for the first time.

* *The Assad regime suffered heavy losses as a result of the drone campaign: Several hundred soldiers, 151 tanks, eight helicopters, three drones, three fighter jets (including two Russian-made Sukhoi Su-24s), around 100 armoured military vehicles and trucks, eight aerial defence systems, 86 cannons and howitzers, ammunition trucks and dumps, and one headquarters, among other military equipment and facilities. -1*

It also, according to unofficial sources, took out the Russian Pantsir air defence system. This was the gamechanger that might have changed the course of warfare. 2

The events in Syria is not the first time drones has been used, but it was the breakthrough. The U.S had previously used drones, but their range, technological limits and inaccuracies had cost more than it was worth. The infamous Afghani wedding party strike in 2008 killed 37 civilians and a lot of U.S goodwill in the region.

The scenario was now different. The drones had performed their task optimally and hit targets precisely. It might also be the deciding factor in the Azerbaijani offensive later that year. However, the main point was not its effectiveness as a whole, but lack countermeasures that Russia could provide.

**A Ukrainian substitute**

One of the main problems that Ukraine is facing in upgrading its armed forces is the lack of funds and personnel to maintain a modern air force. The Ukrainian air force hasn't acquired a new manned warplane since 1991,\*\* It will cost much more than the current budget to replace or modernize them.

The second problem is that there are very few places, if any, where Russian surface-to-air missiles can not target Ukraine's aircraft while they're taking off. Even the country's Southern areas can not be safe for potential SAMs in the Transanitra region of Moldavia. So while Ukraine has logically bought and modernized their transport planes and helicopters, they have gone a different direction regarding the offensive air arsenal, rather concretely south over the Black Sea.

Since last year Ukraine has received and started operating 9 Bayraktar-TB2 drones for reconnaissance work in the front line. From 27 July 2020 until 7 November 2020, only three Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Donbas' frontlines. The reason could have been a shift of focus to Karabakh's ongoing war and reviewed peace talks. Still, it remains the fact that drones have provided a better overview and intelligence of separatist movements in the last months and, without a doubt, have saved the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.

Although I would be careful to state that Turkish drones' acquirement is the reason for the region's escalation, it will be reasonable to think the jargon and the top modern Russian anti-air system's movement frontline is connected. Political players would take the element of drone warfare into account.

**Turkish-Ukrainian cooperation, a Moscow headache**

Francis Fukuyama has stated that the world may have seen its last massive tank battle during the 2003 Iraq War. \*\*\*\* The success of drone warfare has have done much to promote Turkey's rise as a regional power in the year 2020, and the success of its domestic weapon industry is now seen as the country success story.

A more critical point, especially from Ukraine POW, is that the world has still not seemed to catch up with effective countermeasures against the new generation of drones. While Russia has unique and modern anti-air systems, it is still designed for fighter jets and planes, not drones with a wingspan of 12 meters or less. It can be argued that the Russian weapon industry has in its reach to modernize the formal aspects of military, tanks, planes etc., forgot the new technology of drones and laser.

A more severe concern for an attacking force will be if Ukraine starts with weaponizing its drone programme. In cooperation with the Turkish and Qatari weapon industry, the Ukrainians have started with a programme to introduce a small, lightweight catapult-launched loitering weapon system, dubbed RAM. \~ While it might be difficult to hit one Bayraktar drone, a swarm of RAM drones can be next to impossible. Ukrainian troops theoretically could deploy so many drones and loitering munitions—and add unarmed decoy 'bots to the mix, too—that there would be more targets than Russian missiles. The potential targets are then just limited by the scope of enemy material nearby.

The costs of the rockets might be higher than the price of the RAM drones also. The second countermeasures Russia has is jamming the drones. There is clear evidence they already are doing; just a couple of days ago, something jammed an observation drone by the OSCE. However, unlike non-protected OSCE drones, Ukrainian drones most likely use NATO/Turkish countermeasures that, by all indications, are more advanced.

Moscow might need new and better air defences and jammers. If Ukraine goes all-in on drones, Russia might have to go all-in on defences *against* drones, and that takes time, money and technology that will not be ready for battle within a month or so.

**Not a gamechanger in the concise run**

This article bases its arguments on sources and hypothetical situation based on the information available. The aspects of how ready Ukraine is and what countermeasures Russia have is very unreliable.

However, Turkey has decided and influenced heavily three regional conflicts based on the drone weapon platform and arguably have risen to be a regional power to challenge Saudi-Arabia and Iran. Another fact to consider is that the three losing factions (Syria government, Armenia, Libyan House of Representatives) have all been supported and supplied by the Russian arms industry.

The Armenians deployed foreign drones as well: the Russian Orlan-10 UAV. However, the Orlan-10 could not defeat the Bayraktar TB2 UAV. Turkey effectively concluded one of the 'frozen conflicts' of the former Soviet Union through the simple export of a drone fleet and removed a strong playing card from Russia in the region.

It would be wise of Russia not to underestimate Turkey's threat as it loses grounds on two fronts critical to Ankara's national interest. Turkey is in a prime position to leverage its defence relations with Ukraine against Russia, which it already has started with.

In November, Ukraine and Turkey stated they would form a JV to produce Ukrainian armed versions of the Bayraktar TB2 drones.

The Donbas war is also benefiting Turkey as an excellent spot to test the weaponry in live conflict.

To conclude the Turkish aspect, the country is seemingly rising as a global challenger to the Russian military industry as a 100% self-sufficient country in terms of military production. It has placed thoughtfully doubt in Russian hardware for many potential buyers. The Pantsir missile system was specially placed under suspicion as twitter videos showed them reduced to rubble from drone strikes.  The Pantsir system might be in use in the separatist area of Donbas.

On the other hand, Ukraine might finally have a card in the game to move away from the Minsk agreement that is seen as very skewed towards Russia from the perspective of Kyiv. The perceived new hand might also be a part of a renewed political push from Zelensky to remove pro-Russian influence from the country.

This position is where it can become dangerous for Ukraine. Like Saakashvili in Georgia 2008, Ukraine can think they have a more substantial card than reality display. The sheer machine of the Russian military demands more than just drones and history has been demonstrated that Russia will act if given a dare to do so. It is a different story to fight against Russian supported enemies than to fight Russia itself. Like all neighbourhood countries to Russia, the aim is always to make the nation bleed enough until most Russians say it's not worth it.

If the drone programme of Ukraine is as good as the recent confidence from Kyiv has shown, it can be a bloody conflict. Russia's air superiority will not be guaranteed, but there should be no belief that it alone will stop pure determination from Kremlin.

The most lucid optimistic argument comes from Igor Schatz in [this long twitter threat](https://twitter.com/copernicus2013/status/1495936129358520321?s=21). I have compiled it to readable form here. I am curious if anyone here sees major flaws with his reasoning. His basic is that Putin’s bluff has been called and Putin is now chained to an outcome he did not want. Schatz’s comments in essay form below:

My 2 cents on Putin’s decision today:

This is a strategic defeat for Putin and a full-scale war is even less likely after today then before. Let me explain in this thread. The primary goal of Putin has been to subjugate Ukraine and especially its foreign and defense policy to Russian interests and priorities.

In essence the goal was to make Ukraine into a vassal state, a la Belarus where Russia retains full political control and leverage and which is currently in the process of soft annexation. The primary tool to achieve this goal have been Minsk protocol 2 which were signed in 2015 after a Russian-military-led offensive on Debaltseve, a small town in Donbas but a major railway juncture. 

This agreement achieved a cease fire, a pow exchange and basically stopped the active phase of the conflicts. The protocol aimed at reintegrating the separatist part of Donbas into Ukraine proper but on the conditions drafted by separatists’ Russian handlers. More specifically, Putin’s focus on Minsk 2 was on the part that would require Ukraine to conduct a constitutional reform that would give the separatist region a special status that would allow it to veto any foreign and defense policy decisions. 

Since separatists are just Russian puppets and their leaders are in fact Russian citizens ( the current one is even a member of Putin’s party ), this would essentially give Russian government a direct political control over Ukraine, essentially eliminating its sovereignty for all intents and purposes. Additionally, the protocol envisioned full amnesty to separatists many of which engaged in outright criminal activity and human rights abuses that would be on par with Hamas. It also stipulated that the separatist militants would be renamed and remade into a local police with potential jurisdiction over the whole country, and it also put the region in charge of appointing its own judges and prosecutors, that of course would be drawn from the ranks of militants with the implicit advice and consent form Kremlin. You can imagine the kind of Justice that would be practiced by such judges and courts.. there was 0 chance that Ukraine was going to accede to giving up its sovereignty, as it has had 0 political and civic support for obvious reasons.

The confidence game put on by Putin that involved the massive show of force aimed at compelling Ukraine or compelling the west to force Ukraine to abandon its sovereignty via this backdoor maneuver. Putin’s calculus was that the west is divided and weak, Biden Administration is weak especially since he canceled sanctions on NS2 in may and practically agreed at the Geneva summit in June to do Putin’s bidding on talking Ukraine into Minsk 2. 

Putin also counted on destabilizing Ukraine politically by keeping the threats of force, potentially leading to the fall of government and divided country that would lead to a friendlier regime that he could either control or even potentially install. All of these assumptions of Putin were proven wrong… the west is united, and even Putin’s attempt to send separate letters with same demands/proposals to different countries in a gambit to try and pick some off didn’t work.

Instead he got one response from the EU directly basically telling him “buddy, why you wasting your time and printer paper sending your silly letters around when you can just send one directly to Brussels which is where you gonna get a single response from”. His progressive escalation also didn’t work on rattling Ukrainians.. there was no panic in the country, the political leadership was united and showed amazing resilience and resolve and the army was disciplined not to respond to military provocations. 

Putin kept escalating because inertia took over and because he assumed that credible threats of war (culminating with nuclear drills over the weekend) would scare soft Europeans who don’t want war and who are visiting the Kremlin like never before. At the same time, the US has turned up its own info war which basically meant to say that a) we are not going to honor your ultimatums and b) we have seen your war threats and are ready for war if that’s what you intend. 

The reaction from the Ukrainian government was similar a) your demands to give up our sovereignty are unacceptable; b) we will talk about our aspirations to join NATO louder because its our sovereign right to chose alliances we sign up for and c) we see your troops on our borders and hear your threats but we won’t panic and we are confident in our army that acquired a lot of combat experience since 2014 ( I’ve seen a number of 400,000 of Ukrainians with active combat experience ) and is highly motivated. Meanwhile, the UK, Canada, the US and a number of other NATO countries have been sending plane loads of weapons to Ukraine for weeks, on some days up to a dozen planes - to either help deter Putin or help Ukraine army defend the country more effectively. 

In the end, Putin’s confidence game has failed, since he never planned on the actual war which would be costly in resources and lives and very risky since given Ukraine’s resolve he wouldn’t achieve political aims even by military means, he doesn’t have enough troops to control the country which is the 2nd largest in Europe by territory and has a large population motivated to kill an invading force, and this adventure might even cost him his own regime at home.

The decision to recognize the separatist part of Donbas today is probably the worst outcome for him and the best for Ukraine: it buries Minsk protocols, getting Ukraine off the hook politically and preserves the status quo by freezing the conflict but in a favorable state: full responsibility for the area is shifted to Russia, Russian troops that are already present there would now merely operate actually wearing their uniforms and as such holding Russia more accountable for what happens there while accelerating military and economic aid for Ukraine as well as needed domestic reforms that would speed up the eventual path to the EU.  For Putin, this is a strategic defeat because he lost Minsk protocol as a tool for potential political leverage over Ukraine.

Ukraine is now more united, more anti-Russia and on a faster path of spinning out of Kremlin’s “sphere of influence”. Why did Putin go for this option ? Well, faced with western and Ukraine’s resolve in response to his ultimatums and what he thought were credible threats of force, but unwilling to make good on these threats (high five to the boys at Langley for confronting his bluff in the information space) he also needed to save face and show a win for all his Herculean confidence efforts. The win that he needed for this not so much to show to his domestic audience but to show to his own little circle of strongman that constitute his inner circle… because coming out of this as a loser in their eyes would basically dramatically shorten his reign.

The residual risks right now is that the separatists might want to expand their territorial control since they only control 1/3 of the administrative regions in Donbas and claim domain over the whole admin region. While this is a risk, it doesn’t seem highly likely since it would create a risk of a big war for Putin that he was trying to avoid, since expanding territories controlled by “sovereign republics” doesn’t score anything for Putin politically while risking far harsher sanctions and bad optics of dead civilians that allegedly he wants to protect, etc.. this is probably a good time for him to consolidate and absorb mild sanctions from the west while doing his best to shift attention from this issue for now he is likely to come back with another attempt at Ukraine at another time, but for now he knows he lost badly and its better to get attention away from this quickly to make sure the strongmen around him don’t think too hard and realize the same. 

It’s much better for him to focus on the ongoing soft annexation of Belarus which I predicted a month ago. Russian troops aren’t leaving after the end of planned exercises yesterday, and Belarus is holding a constitutional referendum on the 27th. Part of this constitutional reform calls for allowing Belarus to host nuclear weapons on its territory (guess whose wink-wink), and if you followed Belarus elections in August 2020, you’d know that results of the referendum are preordained. 

So we will likely have permanent Russian military bases and nukes on Belarus territory shortly… look on the map and you’ll see that Belarus is quite close to the center of Europe.. this would be a legitimate win for Putin and I think he’d want to focus the attention of his entourage as well as homegamers watching state tv on a legitimate win and away from Ukraine where he lost.. the small wild card is whether anti-Lukashenko protests that were suppressed in 2020 will will resume if the people realize that their independence and sovereignty at stake in a country where Lukashenko has little support and legitimacy.. mind you, Lukashenko has always been independent-minded on behalf of his country and this is a new development. 

Some final thoughts: why has Putin decided to raise the stakes now.. i think COVID is partially responsible.. during COVID Putin has been isolated and has narrowed his inner circle and the people he sees personally. Just look at him meeting foreign leaders to refuse to submit to the anal-probe Covid test at the opposite end of a 50 foot long table. 

My theory is that he is deadly afraid of COVID partly because he has grown more paranoid, partly because he might be immune compromised based on reports of some severe illness he might have had in 2019 (unconfirmed), and also because he is not vaccinated and he has seen the severe death toll of the unvaxxed in Russia. I am pretty confident that he is not vaccinated because he is too paranoid to allow himself to be injected with anything. 

Because his inner circle likely narrowed to the hard liners, this also means that his sources of information and advice have narrowed and he likely only receives advice and info that he wants to see and/or that his entourage wants him to see. And he probably miscalculated in his assumptions that his confidence van would succeed because they were based on information that wasn’t representative of reality. My theory also explains why his speech today was so unhinged. He came across extremely angry, but mainly because he has lost and he had to resort to the option in his arsenal that he wasn’t really planning on using.

To summarize: Putin played a high confidence game to compel the west to new world order and to compel Ukraine to loss of sovereignty and lost. There won’t be a full-scale war (though limited confrontation in the east Ukraine is still very much on the table). But there also won’t be a big deescalation, though I think we will see some troop drawdown shortly since he can’t keep the troops idle for too long living in tents in the middle of the Russian winter end. 

Basically, if Putin was serious about a full-scale invasion he wouldn’t need the theater of recognizing the separatist “republics” first; he also would have had the state prepare the nation for war through months-long war propaganda - which wasn’t happening … Putin thought he was going around open-carrying in Massachusetts but realized that he is in Texas instead... so he had to resort to grabbing a misplaced wallet and retreating to the nearest bar to get drunk.",geopolitics,Ukraine

72,I think Turkey is an extremely misunderstood US partner. Here's my two cents.,459.0,o0jyfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/o0jyfb/i_think_turkey_is_an_extremely_misunderstood_us/,186.0,1623778652.0,"Turkey opposes Russia in basically every front imaginable. Libya (where France’s support is against USA's interest), Syria, Azerbaijan, Ukraine etc, everywhere Turkey is in direct opposition to Russian position.

Forget about Libya, Syria, Azerbaijan maybe (I mean you know those very well). 

Take Ukraine, Turkey is doing what France or Germany should have been doing there. Making military agreements. Yet, as far as I can tell, Turkey doesn’t really hugely benefit neither does Ukraine have any ""huge"" geopolitical significance for Turkey. Granted, a bigger role by someone like Germany is needed to actually stop Russian aggression there.

Similarly, take Afghanistan, after ""official"" US soldiers, Turkey has the highest number of troops there. For what you ask? To serve US interest.

Turkey is also hosting 3.5M refugees or something like that (which is a pretty significant burden). I mean hosting that many people could destabilise entire country’s political balance.

Turkey also plays vital role in many other areas of geopolitical significance for the USA. Too many to write in one sitting.

Yet, there seems to be considerably negative public opinion on Turkey among the populace. Especially in Reddit and Youtube.

Also, the media spins surrounding Turkey also seems to be negative.

But I think this is bad for USA's relations with Turkey. As I think alienating Turkey would ultimately lead to them entering the Chinese sphere of influence.

One thing people point out is Turkey’s power projection. A lot of which is in fact, in support of USA's interest.

Also, Turkey seems to be growing in influence around the region and the Muslim populace. But, I mean, come on. If Turkey develops economically, it is inevitable that its influence would grow and so would its significance. What ultimately matters is that Turkey keeps on performing its roles in USA's interests.

Some people point out that, Turkey purchased the S400, therefore, Turkey is joining the Russia belt. But this line of thinking completely avoids any of the ground reality.

Turkey is a sworn enemy of Russia in almost every geopolitical spaces they are fighting in.

India is also in on S400. Should USA also distance itself from India for that reason? No.

Now, some people point out about growing authoritarianism in Turkey. But this is a complete bs non-issue.
As long as USA's interest is being performed by a country, USA never cares about what goes on within that country. Dictators, human rights violations etc all are done or present in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the other usual suspects. USA itself is probably the biggest savage of all. I don't think authoritarian tendencies should concern the USA as long as that country performs USA's geopolitical interests.

Now, regarding authoritarianism. I don't think Erdogan can do anything if he loses an election. The Turkish state is much bigger than Erdogan.
He is kinda like Trump. Popular among rural voters, conservative voters. And just like Trump, the more the media vilifies Erdogan, the more vote he gets.

But, just as Trump failed to do anything when he failed the election, Erdogan will also be unable to do anything. However, vilifying his voter base could even lead to him winning the election.

Although I think Erdogan will lose the next election due to the ongoing economic challenges in Turkey and the ongoing currency crisis.

Thus, I think this constant narrative of ""Turkey bad"" is incredibly harmful for US's geopolitical interests. And we should try to have more nuance while talking about this country. 
Moreover, pushing Turkey against USA would mean an incredibly useful and resourceful country will become antagonistic to our country. If USA were to win against the Chinese threats, it would be more useful if USA and Turkey remained true partners. 

Might I also point out that Turkey is probably the only Muslim country that has denounced Chinese aggression against Uyghurs in an official capacity, unlike some other so called allies of the USA.

TL;DR: USA and Turkey have a good partnership. Recent media and popular narrative against Turkey is unhelpful for overall geopolitical interest of the USA.",geopolitics,Ukraine

75,Russia's Pacific Strategy,439.0,ruegag,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ruegag/russias_pacific_strategy/,142.0,1641144390.0,"With the eyes of the world fixated on Russia’s border with Ukraine, Moscow is beginning to make major moves 7500km to the East on the Russian Pacific coast. Most major powers have already begun their pivot to Asia, and now Russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. Will Russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant China in this theatre? 

With its heartland west of the Ural Mountains, Russia has long been tightly Europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the Indo-Pacific, Moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. These regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the Soviet Era, and aside from hosting Russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in Vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in Moscow since much of Nuclear forces were redeployed to Kola.   
At present Vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the Kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. The Russian *Vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving Russia could rapidly deploy forces to the Pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of Kremlin planners. The exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. The Russian forces have been a predominately Western focused force, and that stokes fears that the Russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the Pacific front continues to gain importance.   

To try and combat this Putin set in motion his own Pivot to Asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the Russian far-east. Little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in Kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

This issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in Russian surface fleets. With 5 fleets to modernise, Russia’s Pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its Baltic, Northern, and even Black Sea fleets meaning that Vladivostok continues to receive the Russian navies leftovers.  Although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia’s hegemony in the region. 

With an ascendant China in the region though is Russia being delegated to a junior partner? We certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between Russian forces and the PLA and PLAN, and in those operations Russia has largely taken a backseat to China in regional issues, such as Korea. The caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still haven’t seen what would happen if China and Russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. The closeness of the Russia-China relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. For the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

The question I would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for Moscow to place the Pacific front on the same priority level as the Northern or Black Sea fronts, and how would Moscow react to a conflict in the South China sea?   
My gut feeling is that Russia would assist China with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in Europe? I am keen to get this subs thoughts though.

But what if these aren't the best options? Ignoring Ukraine for the moment, what if it is better to let China have Taiwan and then fight on terms better suited to the USA and its allies?

To defend Taiwan would mean putting a lot of US assets into danger - major fleet units would need to sail within range of shore-based aircraft and terminally-guided IRBMs, USMC ships would be even more vulnerable and any fight would be in contested airspace. China's huge SSK fleet is designed to fight in the Straits as are its short-range assets.

Would it not be better to trade 'space for time' as NATO planned to do in a war against the WP? This would enable the USA to utilise its force multipliers without keeping one eye on the clock. The Chinese invasion fleet is a one-shot weapon. It will suffer massive attrition from ROC defences alone, without outside assistance, and the people of Taiwan will not meekly submit to the CCP. The PLA can look forward to constant attrition and civil disobedience.

In the meantime, the US and allies can just pick off the Chinese multipliers one at a time until the PLA is a shadow of its former self and most of the Straits are covered in shipwrecks and splashed aircraft. Until national infrastructure (much less robust than that in the west) is collapsing and sanctions, combined with destruction/surrender of Chinese O/S assets (Gwadar, Trincomalee) are driving China towards starvation and economic collapse with no fuel for their military, no food or power for their people and an increasingly disruptive populace.

Surely this is better than fighting the enemy on a battlefield of his choosing at a time of his choosing?

EDIT 1. Thanks for the awards. I think this post has done its job of stimulating discussion of the matter.

EDIT 2. There seem to be a lot of commenters mistakenly thinking that I'm advocating the abandonment of Japan, ROC and ROK. This is not the case. These nations may suffer short-term pain from a lack of US 'boots on the ground' (or, more accurately, carriers nearby), but their survival depends on the ability of the US to project power, a power I believe will be severely attrited if it attempts to fight the long war on Chinese terms. I am exploring an alternative to the current narrative with the same goal of preserving the independence of Japan and ROK, the de facto independence of Taiwan and the elimination of the PLA threat to Taiwan and the SCS island groups..",geopolitics,Ukraine

This article will be based on tweets, open sources and speculations from analysts of third parties. Take into considerations that no one expects the inner circle of the Kremlin to know what the original plans were and that it is way too to try to make any sense of motivations and reason. Anyone who claims they know what was going on is lying or is propagandizing one side.

**Strange beginning of the year.**

On 21 March 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu in the forest of Siberia for a weekend vacation. The picture showed a smiling President riding off-road vehicles and having a meal with Shoygu in the woods. Only three days later, the movement of troops and equipment started transporting to the Ukrainian border. It is most likely that this was the meeting where the final decision was taken, and some few analysts took notice. The whole photo-op gave the first impression that the troop build-up was sable ratling first of all. The second was the flood of pictures of equipment that went to the border. In thousands of tweets, we could see hobby analysts retweeting Russian images of military equipment, usually followed by very uninformative words like ""this is bad/this is not good"". They were spreading more fear. However, the analysts could take some clues also. Russians did not cover all the sensitive equipment they usually do and was very open about troops and equipment.

On 13 April, some researchers concluded that the war alert was over,\* and by 15th, the U.S. military command had said that the build-up had plateaued and cancelled officially the two warships they promised to send to the Black Sea. Interestingly, the documents needed to cross the Bosphorus were sent in late March, meaning that the U.S. command was only sure that Russia was showing off at some point in mid-April and made the logical decision that having the U.S. ships in the area increased the risk for a conflict.

It was at least one week where the U.S. was not sure about Russian intentions. Around this time, we saw some Western reactions, most noticeable from U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, who in harshly words warned Russia about consequences if Russia starts something in Ukraine. Several U.S., Canadian and U.K. cargo planes landed at Boryspil Airport, most likely bringing military equipment. At some point, something happened that convinced the U.S. that Russia was not planning anything that would change the world order. The aeroplanes stopped coming. Shortly after, it was back to business for the U.S., who announced their long-planned sanctions for Russia. The reader should note that the U.S still provided air surveillance over the border area with drones.

**The lack of details**

There were questions about the adequacy of the logistics present – there was a lot of front-line hardware, very openly paraded, but armies secondary logistics, fuel bowsers, ammunition depots and field kitchen was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 when Russia marched armies near the border, offensive action was ruled out due to the lack of logistics, this time around field hospitals was put up, but the fact that BBC reporter got a lock into the area showed that this was something Russia wanted to show to the world.

In Russian term, it can be a metaphor that in April the army train for whatever comes from August to October. As the mud dries and makes country road possible to drive and thousands of new conscripts comes to serve. The training is always intensified in this period, and by itself, the exercises Russia did was not out of the extraordinary, but the fact that it all happened near the border was.  As more and more forces came, they crossed another checklist on what you need for an offensive. While in 2016 the crisis was quickly brushed aside based on the logistics, this time it felt different. Just like Moscow wanted. The Russian propaganda network at that time also went overdrive with the infamous Russia-1 tv show  Вечер с Владимиром Соловьёвым /Sunday evening with Vladimir Soloyvov calling Ukraine fascists that needed be to stopped. Eventually even the Russian government put out a statement that tv shows and public debate did not reflect the government view on Ukraine.

**The Ukrainian gambit**

2021 was a year Zelensky turned around his domestic policies. He was elected in a landslide in 2019 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the country. He tried to find common ground with Russia, which resulted in a prisoner exchange programme and little else. Frustrated with the lack of compromises Russia gave, he started with a more western friendly policy. He shouts down Russian TV channels and put sanctions on Putin's man in Kyiv, Viktor Medvedchuck.  It was on his background Putin maybe decided to show who Russia was in the region.

Some analysts speculate that Ukraine pushed the situation after a schedule rotation amongst the troops in the frontline of Donbas. That Zelensky added an extra tank battalion along the border. How true this remains to be seen as it was difficult to find any sources to back this up.

As Ukraine can never hope to win in a direct clash against the Russian forces, the Peoples republics in Donbas will collapse within a short time without aid from Russia, a behemoth in armed forces. Ukraine has gone from a corrupt, ineffective army to a normal function one that put up some fight in a potential conflict, making the price for an invasion a little higher in term of blood. However, the soldiers of LPR and DPR are in all categories a militia without any navy or air force. A conflict between Ukraine and the Peoples Republic would be laster much shorter than a war between Ukraine and Russia. In that term, analysts could speculate that Russia development was a strong signal that nothing would happen with Donbas without their permission. Shoygu and Putin could see that annual testing of forces in Crimea and the western part near Ukraine was an excellent way to hit two flies with one swing.

**The Saakashvili trap**

A total invasion of Ukraine was most likely never an option. Such an operation would have demanded much more resources and would be the most significant conflict on European soil since WWII, potentially turning it into a world war. For comparison, the Yugoslavian population right before the split was 22 million, and there is 44 million in Ukraine. Casualties would have been in the hundreds of thousands only indirect fighting. It would have been the total economic collapse for Russia as the international community would have kicked it out of every international agreement such as SWIFT and FX trade. Even Germany could not have defended their economic ties with the country anymore.

The world does not simply work like Victoria 2 anymore. You can not place your troops over a neighbour country capital until you get the choice to annex. Analysts also saw the land grab theory as unlikely to happen. The water shortage crisis in Crimea is severe for Russia, but trying to take control over the dam in Ukraine costs many times what it takes to ship water or build new infrastructure. Furthermore, Some analysts noted that the **Russian national guard** does not deploy to the frontline. This unit is tasked with population control in a hostile environment and would have been needed if concrete plans were to pacify the newly acquired region. If Russia were to control the canal, it would still take years to upgrade it and protect it from Ukrainian sabotage.

What's left was then an escalation in the Donbas region. Most likely, Zelensky was warned by several people not to go into a trap like former Georgian President and now head of the Ukrainian National Reform Council, Mikheil Saakashvili. In 2008 he ordered his troops to answer the escalation in South Ossetia, which gave Russia a casus belli to invade. Ukrainian forces around Donbas did not respond to fire from snipers and held back on mortar shelling, a move that was lauded by the western world. By 21 April, the steam had gone out on the borderline while the increasingly hostile rhetoric from the Russian tv channels cooled down. With Putin's anti-climatic speech on the 21st, the crisis seemed to have peaked.

**The Belarussian**

As a side note, there was also the involvement of the Belarussian President on April 18, where here claimed the U.S had tried to coup the country and kill him. By this time we had observed some Belarussian troops in motion in the southwest part of the country, driving speculation on what the country's role in this buildup was. Furthermore, Lukashenko promised to announce a change he called the biggest of his presidency. As he was scheduled to meet Putin the day after the latter speech to the nation, it was believed and in some cases speculated that the long talked about Union State was happening. However the meeting was about nothing and the announcement was about Lukashenko giving power to the security council, where his son is an influential member if he was assassinated. In those three days between April 21 to April 23, the situation was basically over.

**Who won?**

As the crisis seems to cool down, it might be wrong to say if there was a winner and loser, more the cards have reorganized. It appears that the U.S and the Biden administration managed to play the cards right by making both Russia and China step down while giving support to Ukraine. After all, a non-war is the best success there is.  Russia has tested its infrastructure, prepared a hasty campaign for the future, and got its summit with Biden. Ukraine President Zelensky got support from Erdogan, although the foreign office later vaguely stated they were neutral in the conflict. He also got his long-awaited call with Biden and 300 mln dollar check for new weapons. Money that, if well spent, can fill in some of the weakness in the Ukrainian military. Anti-air weapons, communication equipment and navy expansions should be on top of the wish list for Kyiv.

Although the polls are not back yet, Zelensky might have got out of this with his popularity intact and a new wind to push his reforms. However, his two years as President saw a slow down in the armed forces budget. One of Poroshenko's most enormous success was the turnaround of the military.   Ukrainian and Western officials say Kyiv's more vital armed forces would increase the military cost to Russia of an incursion or invasion. Ukraine's army has evolved from a core of trained soldiers supplemented by volunteer battalions to a more professional corps, hardened by years of fighting. Still, it also demanded about 4% of the country's GDP. It was understandable that Zelensky, who was voted into the office on a domestic and anti-corruption wanted to move those resources. Now he will be forced to follow his predecessor's stance in building up the military.

However, there are some clear losers in this. Many professional NGOs and analysts used public channels to spread fear and conclude that war was imminent, while some few managed to be objective about the situation.

The other losers are the civilians in the occupied areas and around the frontline. Despite this crisis, the situation is deadlocked and Kyiv will not go back to the Minsk agreement.

Referring, of course, to the proposal of appeasement with Russia in order to counter China. Ultimately, the article rejected the approach in favor of attempts to cause a rift between China and Russia through strategies such as allowing India to buy Russian weapons, but its acknowledgement of the idea, and the danger China-Russia represents, seems to be significant.

Is there a growing popularity for a softer approach to dealing with Russia, at least among the think tanks and journalists? President Biden notably [considered Michael Rojansky](https://www.axios.com/biden-national-security-council-russia-director-15d02b7f-f4ca-4386-93a7-893c06947ea3.html) for the role of Russia advisor, although the idea faced criticism due to Rojansky's alleged softness on the Kremlin. Clearly, the idea is not terribly popular in the Democratic Party for obvious domestic reasons. On this subreddit in particular, there have been numerous threads questioning the value of NATO's expansion and commitment to Eastern Europe. Others have written off Russia as a dead or dying power. But the recognition that China is the greatest threat to Western/American interests seems to be relatively unchallenged - and it is the assistance that Russia is offering to China (not vice versa) that has the authors of the above article most worried.

This leads me to several questions I'm curious about:

* Is the 'reverse-Nixon strategy' conceivable? Is it becoming a more popular idea in geopolitical circles?
* What would be the consequences of 'letting Russia have Ukraine' in its sphere of influence? Is Ukraine truly meaningful to Western interests?
* How dangerous is the growing partnership between Russia and China? What action should it warrant?",geopolitics,Ukraine

[https://ecfr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine.pdf](https://ecfr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine.pdf)

>The countries surveyed were Poland and Romania – frontline, traditionally Russia-sceptic, states in central Europe; France, Germany, and Italy – large western European states that previously earned reputations as Russlandverstehers (“Russia understanders”); Portugal and Spain – southern European states that have in the past generally been less involved in Russia policy; Finland and Sweden – northern European states that are applying for NATO membership as a result of the invasion; and Great Britain.

Polled people where divided into three main groups. Peace, Justice and Swing voters.

>...clear divisions emerge in the poll when voters choose between whether Europe should seek to end the war as soon as possible – even if it means Ukraine making concessions \[Peace camp\] – or whether the most important goal is to punish Russia for its aggression and to restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine – even if such a road leads to protracted conflict and more human suffering \[Justice Camp\].

&#x200B;

>While some pro-Russian (or anti-American) voters might be part of the Peace camp, this does not necessarily make the Peace camp a Russia-friendly grouping. While both Peace and Justice camps agree that Russia and Ukraine will each be worse off as a result of this war, the Justice camp believes Russia above all will be “much worse off”– while Peace camp members ~~Peace versus Justice: The coming European split over the war in Ukraine – ECFR/452 9~~ foresee that, of the two, Ukraine will suffer more. Some in the Peace camp may therefore want the war to end because they consider it is inflicting excessive suffering on Ukraine.

The peace camp amounts to about 35% of voters, justice 22%, swing voters 20% and rest 23% (Page 6). But numbers vary greatly in different countries. The biggest peace camps are in Italy (52%) and Germany (49%), while the justice camp amounts to 41% in Poland, who is a huge outlier, and 25% in Finland.

>The findings of the poll suggest that European public opinion is shifting, and that the toughest days may lie ahead. The resilience of European democracies will mostly depend on the capacity of governments to sustain public support for policies that will ultimately bring pain to different social groups. This will force governments to balance the pursuit of European unity behind pressure on Moscow with opinions that diverge both inside and among member states. The survey reveals a growing gap between the stated positions of many European governments and the public mood in their countries.

When asked who is mainly responsible for the outbreak of the war in Ukraine: Russia or any of Ukraine, EU or US the majority in all countries assigned the blame to Russia. Only Germany (66%), France (62%), Romania (58%) and Italy (56%) polled below 70%. In these four a substantial part of the population assign blame to Ukraine, EU, US (France 18%, Germany 20%, Romania 21% and Italy 27%). A median 12% either had no opinion or assigned blame somewhere else.

>War is like a rollercoaster: public opinion can change with every twist and turn, and it is also a hugely powerful driver. As Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times wrote recently, “The war in Ukraine is essentially being fought on three fronts and among three protagonists. The first front is the battlefield itself. The second front is economic. The third front is the battle of wills. The three participants are Russia, Ukraine and the western alliance backing Ukraine.

The challenge comes from swing voters (20% of the population), who are believed to be more likely to swing to the peace camp once their economic reality is under pressure, which might be felt fully come winter.

>While the Ukraine conflict could yet prove to be the midwife of a much more muscular EU, this research shows that support for increased defence spending is weaker among the public than it might appear if one were to listen only to political leaders.  
>  
>Perhaps the most worrying sign is that most Europeans see the EU as a major loser in the war, rather than reading its relative unity as a sign of a strengthening union.  
>  
>The danger remains that the Peace and Justice camps could yet become as polarised as the debtors and creditors in the euro crisis of the early 2010s. If this is allowed to happen – and if the EU becomes immobilised by its own divisions – then the war could signal the permanent marginalisation of Europe on the world stage.  
>  
>European public opinion fortified the EU’s unity in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is now up to Europe’s leaders to sustain this unity. Finding a language that appeals to the Swing voters – tough on Russia, but cautious about the dangers of escalation – could provide a way of squaring the circle of public opinion.

>If the EU manages to maintain the broad front it has shown so far, and if governments from all sides hang together rather than trying to humiliate one other, a stronger – geopolitical – Europe could still emerge from the shadow of war.",geopolitics,Ukraine

President Donald Trump threatened a new escalation of the trade war with China, saying US tariffs on Chinese goods would be “raised very substantially” if no truce was reached with officials in Beijing. 

Mr Trump’s comments at the Economic Club of New York highlight the trouble the US administration is having in its efforts to strike an interim deal with China that would bring a halt to the commercial conflict afflicting the world’s two largest economies. 

After Mr Trump announced that a tentative agreement had been secured in early October, US and Chinese officials have been haggling over the details, including where a deal would be signed and whether Washington would roll back existing levies as part of such a settlement.


Mr Trump said a “significant phase one deal with China” remained “close” and “could happen soon”, as Beijing was “dying to make a deal”. But he also warned that higher levies would follow if the talks faltered.

I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs

President Donald Trump on US trade talks with China
The US has placed 25 per cent tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and 15 per cent tariffs on a further $112bn of Chinese goods. It has threatened new 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese products in December. 

“I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs, they are going to be raised very substantially,” Mr Trump warned. 

Mr Trump used the speech in New York, his hometown, to defend his administration’s protectionist trade policies and his economic record ahead of next year’s presidential election campaign

He said his administration had “delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations” after nearly three years in office, but blamed the Federal Reserve for restraining growth under his watch. 

The president, who has frequently challenged the Fed’s independence by demanding easier monetary policy, said the US was at a “competitive disadvantage” because it had not followed the eurozone into the land of negative rates. 

“Give some of that money, I want some of that money,” he said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year, after raising them last year, but has since suggested it will pause easing for the time being. 

Mr Trump’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his presidency, on the eve of public impeachment hearings over the Ukraine scandal in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and less than a year from the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump wants to tout his economic prowess as a key selling point in the 2020 campaign, in a bid to hold on to the swing voters who propelled him to the White House in the race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. 

“We have ended the war on American workers, we have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Mr Trump said. 

Despite record highs in US stock markets, persistently low unemployment and strong consumption, there have been some warning signs for the US president about the health of the economy. The pace of growth has slowed throughout the year, with both agricultural producers and manufacturers in the American heartland bearing the brunt of the trade wars and weakening global output. 

This has exposed Mr Trump to criticism from Democrats that his policies have backfired, failing to live up to their promise of boosting the prospects of average middle-class households Despite all the pressure exerted through tariffs, the US administration has failed to secure any major concessions from China on the toughest trade issues like industrial subsidies and the theft of intellectual property. 

US agrees limited trade deal with China
Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank, said: “This laughable cheerleading in front of Wall Street pretty much sums up Trump’s economic agenda: no real results for the country at large, but delivering for the titans of Wall Street and corporate monopolies.”

Mr Trump’s more pugnacious, protectionist approach to trade has been a cornerstone of his economic agenda from the beginning of his presidency — and many businesses have complained that the uncertainty it created has frozen their investment plans.

But Mr Trump appeared to reject those claims. He said: “They were totally down. Now they’re a little bit down because a little bit, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars. But there is no uncertainty.”

As they await word on the US-China talks, investors and officials are also closely watching Mr Trump’s decision, expected this week, on whether to impose tariffs on car imports, after labelling them a threat to national security. Mr Trump did not mention the issue, which is a big risk to EU carmakers in particular, but the administration is expected to grant Brussels a new reprieve from the levies.",geopolitics,Ukraine

By the end I express the view that Assad's government has a chance of not surviving the next decades. 

It is becoming increasingly clear that Turkey plans to consolidate strategic control over Kurdish territories in Iraq and Syria, ensuring once and for all that Kurdish nationalism doesn't spill out into Turkey as it has done during the violent period of the Turkey-PKK war. Turkey is already rumored to have set up military infrastructure in the allied Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq. Same through the Syrian National Army and direct Turkish occupation in Syria. 
Turkey does not trust other governments to take care of the «Kurdish issue». Turkish policymakers remember how Hafez Al Assad allowed the PKK to set up camps in Syria in order to direct the Syrian Kurds attention from himself. Even the Kurdistan Regional Government, which is a Turkish ally, cannot keep the PKK out of it's own territory. Thus, I believe that Turkey will settle for nothing but direct control over those lands.

Additionally, Turkey views Assad/Alawite-dominated Syria as a source of instability and radicalization of Sunnis on it's doorstep. It considers a pro-Turkish, Islamist government in Damascus to be the key for stability in the Middle East. The rule of an Alawite minority Turkey sees as a death sentence for a stable Syria and constant source of future civil conflict. 

Thus, it would be logical to conclude that Turkey does not plan to ever leave Syria or abandon it's support for the Syrian National Army due to the points I listed above.


With the damage dealt to Russian internal stability and economy due to the invasion of Ukraine, demographic crisis and general decline, it is very likely that Russia will eventually end it's costly intervention and leave Assad, having far more important issues at home. 
The Syrian Arab Army without the backing of the Russian Air Force will not be considered a proper fighting force. It suffers from issues that will plague it as long as Assad is in power - corruption, low morale, sanctions affecting the quality and quantity of equipment. This means that without an external backer, Assad will not survive any serious Turkish offensive. 


With Russia out of the equation, the only state left that will be willing to support Assad is Iran. Syria serving as a crucial land link between Iran and Lebanon in any potential conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Iran will have to always maintain a friendly regime in Damascus. 
Iranian activities in Syria are estimated to be incredibly costly, and this is with Russia bearing a significant part of the financial burden, providing air support, modern SAM systems and other crucial aid. Soleimani was the one who invited Putin into Syria, and how Iran will be able to maintain it's presence there without Russia is not clear. 


This leads to the final question, comparing Iranian and Turkish military capabilities.

Iran's most threatening aircraft consist of old American jets left over from the Shah that the Islamic Republic has maintained using facilities built as part of Shah's contracts with American defense companies. Iran has no proper tank force, no specialized logistical vehicles that can withstand desert conditions, and lacks pretty much everything required for conventional warfare. This is why Iranian doctrine is reliant on asymetric warfare, but without Russian support this will not be an option in Syria. The Iranian ballistic missile arsenal is quite impressive, but attacks in the Turkish rear are out of the question due to Article 5 of NATO. 

On the opposite, Turkey is armed with advanced weaponry per NATO standards, fields an air force larger than France, a navy that will with ease blockade Syrian ports, and has an innovative domestic arms industry that will only continue to grow as time goes on. 


If we envision a future where Russia leaves Syria and Iran's presence in regime-controlled territory significantly weakens, won't it be very tempting for Turkey to fulfill the goals detailed in the beginning, solving the Kurdish «problem» and reshaping Syria into a somewhat stable state that won't cause problems for Turkey in the future? 

Theoretically, the open geography of Syria is favorable for swift armored maneuver as the Gulf War showed in identical conditions in Iraq. The majority of the Syrian population, Arab Sunnis, will probably be on the Turkish side. Israel will gladly provide intelligence and perhaps even military assistance. 

Of course, fully invading Syria will not be a cakewalk, as Turkey will have to confront Hezbollah and the IRGC, both potent fighting forces, but will this stop the Turks from securing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? Only time will tell. 

I will gladly listen to all comments disagreeing with my arguments.",geopolitics,Ukraine
109,Unanswered Questions on the Ukrainian-Russian War,316.0,uf5leq,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/uf5leq/unanswered_questions_on_the_ukrainianrussian_war/,211.0,1651301227.0,"Here are a few questions that I don't see being addressed much but should make for interesting discussion here:

* **What is Putin planning for the 1 million forcibly deported Ukrainian civilians?**
   * 1 million Ukrainians are estimated to have been forcibly deported from eastern Ukraine to eastern Russia.
   * The tactic does have some precedent in Soviet history but I suspect the strategy is different this time.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/04/02/russia-deportation-ukraine-baltics/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/04/02/russia-deportation-ukraine-baltics/)I'd be interested if anyone has any other precedents to point to.
   * There have already been reports of Russian offers to trade civilians for POWs.
   * This is potentially strong Russian leverage in peace talks. Is there anything Ukraine can do to counter this? Any sort of rescue operation seems out of the question given that Ukraine doesn't have a navy and that Russia's landmass is enormous.
* **Why is the Russian Naval force in the Black Sea still afloat?**
   * Everyone, including me, was surprised when Ukraine managed to take out the Moskva. Even more surprising is that by all accounts they managed to do so with their own missile technology (and a cheap drone distraction).
   * But now we are in a different phase. The western powers have made clear that they have no hesitation in handing Ukraine whatever weapons are available. And Turkey is enforcing an agreement that stipulates that warships cannot pass through the Turkish straits. Now no Russian naval ship can leave or enter the Black Sea.
   * So if you are a country like the US, UK, France, etc..., why not give Ukraine whatever stealth sub drones/stealth missiles you have that you think can take out Russian warships and let them loose in the Black Sea? For those countries/companies it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to test out their technology and eradicate an irreplaceable Russian fleet in the process.
   * Obviously you don't want that tech falling into the wrong hands, but frankly that should be manageable. Underwater tech is the easiest to self-destruct.
   * It may be that this will happen a month from now and it's only a matter of timing. It seems to me that this is not the occasion to be hesitant. And we've seen how severe a blow to Russian morale it was to lose a battleship.
* **Should Ukraine and the west offer a face-saving way out for Putin and if so, what could that be?**
   * The sanctions have considerably upped the ante on this war. Any resolution that does not include the relaxation of those sanctions will be a very tough pill for Russia to swallow. And I don't see the sanctions being relaxed as long as Russia continues to hold Ukrainian territory. At the same time, I can't see Russia declaring victory without holding any Ukrainian territory and I can't see Putin declaring defeat as it would very likely be his downfall.
   * So the question is -- is there something else that can be offered which would both allow a Russian declaration of victory and yet satisfy Ukraine and the west enough to end the war + sanctions? I can't come up with anything. Any ideas? If not, we may be looking at a very long conflict indeed.
   * The alternative is that Russia builds up leverage not just against Ukraine but against the West as well. They could for instance threaten to use Russian submarine attacks on cargo ships to block every major strait/western port. That would be extremely dangerous for Russia as their navy is heavily outmatched but perhaps there are some other similar moves I'm not considering. There is of course the scary possibility of building leverage through a demonstrated willingness to use tactical nukes/chemical weapons.
   * You could also answer that there is no possible resolution until Putin is replaced. But that is very dangerous for the world as well. Coups and instability in general in the world's second largest nuclear power are a terrifying possibility. A peaceful transfer of power supported by the population would be much, much safer. I don't like him either but thousands of loose nuclear weapons is something I dislike even more.
   * Really what we're asking here is, if Ukraine wants to fight on (and every indication is that they do), how can this war possibly end?
* **What is the demographic effect of this on Russia?**
   * Russia's demographics are already abysmal. ""In 2018, the total fertility rate across Russia was estimated to be 1.6 children born per woman"". And that was before Covid took a huge bite out of the population. Russian demographics have only been kept afloat in the last 20 years by immigrants. It has the third-largest immigrant population in the world (almost all from ex-Soviet States).
   * Now you have \~20-25,000 dead Russian 18-25 year old males (increasing with every day that this war continues) and you have hundreds of thousands - a million Russians who have emmigrated since the war has begun. [https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-russians-leaving-their-country/a-61364390](https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-russians-leaving-their-country/a-61364390).
   * Now the economy is suffering and millions of those immigrants who came to Russia for work are going to start going back. And the young native Russians fleeing the country are not just any Russians, they are the ones with the skills and education you most require to improve the economy long term. Now there are reports that Biden is going to waive visa requirements for highly educated Russians who want to move to the US. He won't be the last to do it. What happens when Putin declares that conscripts are going to start being sent to Ukraine as well? How many more will try to flee then?
   * I wouldn't be surprised if Russia tried to close its borders to stop emmigration a la the Soviet Union.
   * I should add that people often associate wars with population booms like the one that happened after WWII in the US. But I want to caution you not to have that expectation here. Not all wars are equal. Look at the figures after Vietnam, you will see the birthrate decline and stabilize, not increase. I wonder if population booms only come after major, *successful* wars? Wars that leave you thinking the world is now a better, safer place to raise children in? Regardless don't bank on that effect in Russia in the years to come.
* **Will any other countries see this as an opportunity to reclaim territory from Russia as well?**
   * With the Russian army looking both weak and thoroughly preoccupied at the moment, will any other countries be bold enough to jump on this chance? Japan just reestablished territorial claims on islands between Japan and Russia. Georgia has begun applying to join the EU. Moldova is increasingly nervous about Russian plans for Transnistria.
   * Let's say you are the Georgian or Moldovan government and you speak to Biden and discover that the US is willing to extend the terms of the lend-lease deal with Ukraine to you as well should you make your move now. And why not? Russia has taken your land as well, just like it has Ukraine's, and the US feels a bit hypocritical for not supporting you more then. Do you seize this opportunity? It's unlikely to come around again.
   * What about Chechens? Will they be tempted to rise up once more?
   * Russia has an incredible land mass. One that neither its population nor its economy can really support these days. Now there's blood in the water as well ...

111,Russian invasion to Ukraine. Russian opinion.,294.0,rgw8vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rgw8vt/russian_invasion_to_ukraine_russian_opinion/,240.0,1639564728.0,"I’m from Russia. I’m not a Putin paid troll, I’m actually an engineer. I also never voted for Putin and not going to cause I disagree with him on 2/3 of his internal policy. But this fact doesn’t mean that I can’t put myself in his shoes and guess what and why he’s doing. I also happen to watch American news sometimes and I haven’t seen there any explanation of this new crisis more sophisticated than “Putin is a dictator who wants to invade Ukraine for the sake of his self-esteem”. This situation forced me to write this post.

Let’s go back in time and remember Caribbean crisis. It all started with the United States deploying their intermediate range missiles in Turkey and the USSR replying with similar missiles in Cuba. For those people who never actually cared reding about missile types here is the shortest review ever:

Short-range ballistic missile: < 500km range.

Shorter-range ballistic missile: 500-1000km range.

Intermediate-range ballistic missile: 1000-5500km range.

Long-range ballistic missile: > 5500km range.

For obvious reasons, the shorter the range, the lower the price, which leads to deployment of intermediate (and shorter) range missiles to be pretty cheap which allows escalation to be fast and more dangerous. Ultimately this crisis lead to understanding of how dangerous this rocket spamming is and in 1987 the treaty was signed called Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which banned both Soviet Union and the US from deployment and development of shorter and intermediate range ballistic missiles. There are other treaties which were signed close to the end of Cold War such as New START, which reduced the quantity of nuclear devices in both countries, Treaty on Open Skies, which allows unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants, Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems and so on.

Those treaties lead us to this world we know where people don’t think of nuclear weapon much and war in general isn't somethink thought about often, at least in developed countries and many other places such as Russia or China. Ultimately, all those treaties created a balance where nor Russia nor the US can spam enough missiles to flood the world with them, can’t build a Missile Defense Systems large enough to counter those ballistic missiles which are still allowed for the other side and this guaranty mutual destruction in case of nuclear war. This measures also ensure that any nuclear strike if one is to happen anyway, leaves some time to talk it out while missiles are in flight (about 40 minutes). All of this prevents hot heads from actually wondering about what if… It’s mutual destruction. Period.

On December 13, 2001, George Bush announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems.

On August 2, 2019 Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

On November 22, 2020, Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on Open Skies.

Currently we only have New START left which was signed by Putin and Biden right after US elections left. So now there is nearly no obligations which prevent new Caribbean crisis from happening. And of course Putin is concerned about it. Now there are talks about Ukraine joining NATO. It’s just impossible for Russia to tolerate such thing because from Ukraine it’s less than 500km range to Moscow, cause the only way for Russia to enter the Atlantic ocean (nearly entire Russian trade goes there) is through Black See, and for many other reasons known in details to Russian military only.

During Caribbean crisis such threats to mutual safety lead to understanding of the danger by both sides, but now we don’t have such understanding. NATO is consuming ex-soviet countries, all the treaties ensuring mutual safety are being cancelled by the US and all concerns of Russia are ignored.

Let's suppose Mexico has joined a military alliance with China and is deploying chines military on the US boarder in 1 minute flight time from Washington. There won’t be any time to talk if missiles are launched, there won’t be any way to stop it in flight. There won’t be any defense from it which is economically possible. The idea that US government would say that it's fine, Mexico is a free country, we are fine with chineese missiles on our border is unbeliavable. And the Caribbean crisis is a proof of this.

Still Russian concerns are ignored. And this is why all of this war talks went this far. This invasion is actually possible in only one case: the case of NATO actually offering Ukraine to join, and Putin being left without a diplomatic solution of this. Nobody in Russia wants this conflict to happen, because what’s the point? American sanctions already decreased salary in dollars for people of Russia more than two times since 2014. Economical profit for Russia in case of invasion? None. Putin’s rating? It would fall cause people care about their salaries more than about anything else and nobody supports wars where you're actually supposed to fighn yourself and in case of this supposed war risks of mobilisation are pretty high. So there will be no Russian invasion unless NATO military are deployed there. And I really hope that americans are going to put yourself in our shoes and understand that US government went too far pretending Russia has no right to have any concerns about its safety while US are allowed to do anything not bothering to think about other countries interests.",geopolitics,Ukraine

It is not possible to cross the Gibraltar Strait without crossing Spanish Territorial waters. The same happens in the Baltic Sea: it is not possible to exit it without passing through Swedish or Danish waters (both in the EU).

Based on this, **I have two questions**:

1. **Does maritime law allow for Spain, Sweden or Denmark to completely block those straits to trade vessels?**
2. **How much would it hurt Russia?** \`This would completely block the port of Saint Petersburg and shut down all Russian maritime trade from the Black Sea.

After the collapse of USSR, Russia has been suffered from demographic crisis(population decline) and harsher geography for defense (borderline is closer to capital Moscow and the length of borderline is much longer). In order to get rid of strategical inferiority, Russian would try to retake some ex-USSR countries back and make Russian demographics and borderline more decent and stable. Military interventions in Crimea and Donbass region are just one of the first phase strategic actions, regaining its influence on East Europe. The next would be invading and annexing these ex-communist countries. According to him, Russia should hurry up before Russian military became too small to take military actions at least decently from youth population decline. The below is the summary of his proposed Russian strategy.

Of course, his overall thought has gone too far. He even suggested the war between Russia and some NATO states(3 Baltic States, part of Poland and Romania)/Caucasus region. Directly confronting and fighting NATO would be suicide for Russia. Getting involved in Caucasus would be also disastrous, considering Russian history that getting entangled in just Chechen region for a long time. However, if Russia ends its expansion on invading and annexing non-NATO and non-Caucasian states such as Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the overall strategy might be a little bit rational for Russia.

He is an attorney, political activist and blogger that gained notoriety through his [crusade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/net-impact) against Vladimir Putin.  Primarily through advocacy on YouTube, where his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NavalnyRu) as of this writing exceeds 6.4 million subscribers, Navalny highlights the Russian government’s corruption with particular emphasis on theft of state assets by Vladimir Putin and the circle of oligarchs that stand behind him. 

**Novichok & Context**

In August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in Germany following an assassination attempt with a [novichok nerve agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/world/europe/navalny-opcw-russia-novichok.html).  Novichok nerve agents are a type of binary chemical weapon.  Binary chemical weapons are stored and transported in the form of their less toxic chemical precursors, which makes them harder to identify and detect before use.  Novichok nerve agents belong to a class of chemical weapons developed by the USSR starting in the early 1970s.  While known to be currently manufactured by several other countries outside the current Russian federation, a similar novichok nerve agent was used for the purpose of assassinating Sergei and Yulia Skripal at their home in England in 2018.  

Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who acted as a double-agent for the United Kingdom’s intelligence services from the 1990s to 2000s.  Skripal was arrested outside his home in Moscow in December 2004, before being convicted of high treason against the Russian federation for his espionage activities in service of the British crown.  

Though sentenced to thirteen years in prison, he was exchanged for several Russian nationals who were imprisoned for life in the United Kingdom as a part of a spy swap in 2010.  While the Russian Federation had since abolished capital punishment, many [suspected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/sergei-skripal-does-revenge-for-treason-lie-behind-harm-to-ex-spy) that Skripal’s assassination was intended as a death sentence carried out from afar.  A similar fate befell the former FSB and KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a polonium isotope six years after he defected to the United Kingdom in the early 2000s with his wife and young son.  

And Vladimir Putin’s political rivals have not only died as a result of exposure to chemical weapons or radioactive isotopes.  For example, Boris Nemtsov was [gunned down](https://www.tvc.ru/news/show/id/62541) while jogging across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, in front of the Kremlin walls and near Red Square in February 2015, two days before he was supposed to attend a protest against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Few [seriously questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/world/europe/killing-of-boris-nemtsov-putin-critic-breeds-fear-in-russia.html) Putin’s involvement --- particularly in consideration of the fact that Ramzan Kadyrov’s former security chief almost certainly pulled the trigger.  A [show trial](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/3/russia-five-men-stand-trial-for-boris-nemtsov-murder) resulted in five Chechens being convicted for Nemstov’s assassination.  Beyond Nemtsov, at least Boris Berezovsky, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin all rank among assassinations behind which Putin and his government are the [common denominator](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-20170325-story.html).  

**Neither Death Nor Exile**

Before his return, one might have expected that Navalny would have availed himself of the opportunity to remain in [exile](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/06/508477662/political-exile-a-centuries-old-russian-tradition-returns), like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as opposed to the death he narrowly escaped before.  Navalny chose neither.  

After having recovered from poisoning by the novichok nerve agent, Navalny returned to Russia on January 17, 2021.  Navalny was arrested immediately upon return.  Navalny’s arrest was met with global outrage.  Navalny was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and faced a suspended sentence several years back --- despite the complete lack any credible evidence whatsoever to substantiate the charges.  He has been repeatedly arrested, served multiple prison sentences and he has been physically attacked by Putin’s “supporters” on multiple occasions.  In one such incident, a green dye commonly used as an antiseptic was [thrown in his face](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39735867) while in a [Siberian village](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-39337139).  Despite being subject to politically motivated fake criminal charges, assault and scores of other insults, Navalny has persevered.  

Two days later, on January 19, 2021, Navalny released a video titled [Putin’s Palace - History of the world’s largest bribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI), which has amassed more than 110,000,000 views since release.  The video alleges that a property valued at approximately $1.37 billion (US) located on the Black Sea was built for Putin’s benefit by the circle of oligarchs that form his inner circle.  Putin denies ownership.  [Yet, BBC coverage from 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17730959) quotes one of Putin’s business associates as having indicated that every last detail of the Bond-villain style palace was designed according to Putin’s precise specifications. 

Around the same time, Navalny released a [recorded phone conversation](https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-poisoning-underpants-202f470c2d1c19151b9deb564d94e8f9) in which he pretended to be an FSB officer, debriefing the FSB agent who poisoned him.  In the call, the poisoner apologetically states that the “situation would have turned out differently” if Navalny’s plane had not made the emergency landing that enabled Navalny to receive emergency medical treatment.  And of course, the situation might further have ended differently had Navalny not received medical care in Germany.  According to the call, the FSB agent placed the combined novichok agent inside Navalny’s underwear.  

Based on its OSINT investigation, Bellingcat [revealed the FSB team of chemical weapons experts behind Navalny’s poisoning](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/) who were likewise involved in a series of other [murders of Russian political activists](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/01/27/navalny-poison-squad-implicated-in-murders-of-three-russian-activists/).  The details of Bellingcat’s investigation are essentially confirmed by the phone call Navalny staged with the FSB operative who poisoned him --- though the FSB told the Associated Press that Navalny’s video was fake.

Following Navalny’s arrest, the largest protests in more than a decade erupted across Russia.  Tens of thousands took to the streets in sub-zero temperatures from Moscow to Yakutsk in which over 5,100 people [were arrested](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-moscow-coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-russia-085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c) in at least [109 cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/international-home/russia-protests-navalny.html) in each of Russia’s eleven time-zones.  Every single major city in Russia saw demonstrations in support of Navalny, prompting [unprecedented](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-moscow-60bb3ba4b68e80db4239e96c2d7ab060) repression tactics by Russian police. 

Rather than backing down in response, the pro-Navalny demonstrations have continued to gain [momendum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/across-russia-pro-navalny-demonstrations-continue-to-build-momentum) and show no sign of dissipating.  Masha Gessen [explained](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/alexey-navalnys-fearless-return-to-russia) that:

> [Navalny] has . . . show[n] people what they had always known about the Putin regime but had the option of pretending away.  He has shown the depth of the regime’s corruption.  He has shown that Putin’s secret police carries out murders.  With his return to Russia, he has shown the regime’s utter lack of imagination and inability to plan ahead.  He has also shown that, contrary to the Kremlin’s assertions and to conventional wisdom among Western Russia-watchers, there is an alternative to Putin. 

Now, there is no clear path forward where Putin isn’t the clear loser.  If Putin does manage to eventually kill Navalny, Russia may face international retaliation at least as severe as that imposed on Russia after Sergei Magnitsky’s murder.  On the other hand, if Putin does not manage to kill Navalny, Putin’s political rivals will continue to be emboldened, as Putin’s power-base ages and fragments.  While the point at which domestic and/or international political pressure rises to the level of an existential threat to Putin’s control remains unclear, Navalny has moved Russia in that direction.  Putin has never been weaker than he is now. 

**Geopolitics of Navalny’s Return**

The West is not without leverage against Russia, however limited the options may be.  Economic [sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-eu-idUSKBN2A924T), in particular, are a preferred means of coercion.  For example, in 2012 the Obama Administration signed the bipartisan Magnitsky Act into law, which imposed particularized economic sanctions against individuals implicated in Sergei Magnitsky’s murder in a Moscow prison.  Thereafter, numerous other countries passed similar legislation.  Magnitsky-style sanctions blacklisted named persons from Western banks and financial institutions and prohibited nearly all forms of commercial transaction with Western entities or individuals.  In addition, some states have denied visas, restricted travel and frozen and/or seized assets owned or controlled by individuals subject to such sanctions.  Russia maintains that these efforts violate Russian sovereignty and interfere with Russia’s judicial system.  

So far, the United States and Canada have condemned the Russian government’s actions in relation to Navalny and the protests supporting him.  And beyond Magnitsky-style sanctions, other punitive economic measures have been proposed.  

In Europe, two camps have emerged along familiar lines: (1) the United Kingdom, France, and Central and Eastern European countries like Poland, Romania and the Baltic states which historically take more [hawkish positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/18/alexei-navalny-us-europe-condemn-arrest-of-poisoned-putin-critic.html) toward Russia and Putin’s government; and (2) commercially entangled Western European countries like Germany and Italy, who seek to compartmentalize economic interests and human rights abuses.  

For example, [France](https://www.dw.com/en/france-presses-germany-to-ditch-nord-stream-2-over-navalny/a-56411291) has already urged Germany to scrap the gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, with Russia in response to Navalny’s assassination attempt and Russia’s anti-democratic political repression.  Yet, while Berlin has condemned the Kremlin and demanded Navalny’s release, Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman Martina Fietz has made clear that the German government has no intention of changing course with respect to future pipeline construction.  Likewise, Armin Laschet, who is the new leader of Merkel’s CDU party criticized any attempt to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool of political leverage against Putin’s government, [arguing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-laschet-exclusive/exclusive-navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-new-german-cdu-chief-says-idUSKBN2A51FL) that:

> For 50 years, even in the aggressive times of the Cold War, Germany has bought gas from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. The German government is following the right course.

German Economic Minister Peter Altmaier has likewise spoken out against linking Moscow’s political repression to Nord Stream 2, [stating](https://www.rferl.org/a/german-minister-warns-against-linking-fate-of-navalny-with-nord-stream-pipeline/31090454.html) that: 

> Business relationships and business projects that have existed for decades are one thing and serious human rights violations and our reactions to them are another.

Further, calls within the [United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55844146) to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who own or control interests in English football teams have been heard throughout Parliament.

But whether it is wise to punish Putin’s Russia for Navalny’s attempted assassination by sanctions or otherwise is another matter entirely.  Would imposing sanctions in response to the assassination attempt be nothing more than a symbolic gesture of condemnation?  Alternatively, would they be oriented towards *actually bringing about democratic reform* inside Russia and ending Putin’s regime?  Would the symbolic value of imposing sanctions at all be worth the risk that their imposition might wind up strengthening Putin’s hold on power?  And of course, would imposing sanctions make Navalny look like the Western puppet that many Putin supporters have alleged?  

The theoretical basis for when sanctions should work is straightforward:  impose costs greater than whatever benefit the target derives from continuing in the conduct for which he is being sanctioned.  And sanctions are typically effective at bringing about the specific harm they are oriented to cause.  The problem is that the harm sanctions create almost never translates to actual changes in policy consistent with the sanction’s intent and often bring about unintended consequences.  

Russia’s own punitive measures against Ukraine in the mid-2000s provide an illustrative example.  [Seitz & Zazzaro]( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2) found that when Russia punished Ukraine for democratic and pro-Western reform by raising gas prices, those affected “were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style political and economic systems” --- the exact opposite of what the Kremlin intended.  There is more to be said about why sanctions typically fail, but for our purposes it is enough to ask whether the foreseeable risks of backlash in response to Western sanctions outweigh any likely benefit.  

**The Future of Democracy in Russia**

Vadim Nikitin and others have [argued](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/putin-navalny-russia-protests/) that Navalny’s decision to return to Russia:

> … was an act of such singular courage that it seemed to send a jolt of electricity through the nation’s jaded conscience

It is by no means clear that Navalny will lead Russia to a democratic future.  Nor is it clear that Putin will not try --- and succeed --- to assassinate Navalny, again.  But this moment belongs to the Russian people, and the United States and Europe would do well to reflect on its significance.  For democracy to prevail in Russia, change must arise from within.  After all, these protests in support of Navalny mirror those that preceded [color revolutions across the Soviet bloc](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vladimir-putins-unchanging-unthinking-response-to-alexey-navalny).  Likewise, it is worth recalling that six months after Lenin’s [return from exile under similar circumstances](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/vladimir-lenin-return-journey-russia-changed-world-forever-180962127/) in Germany, he led the newly formed Soviet Union that emerged from Imperial Russia’s ashes. 

What is clear is that external pressure --- whether in the form of sanctions, cancelled business dealings or otherwise --- will reinforce Putin’s control of Russian politics and unite Russians against the West.  Several years ago, Navalny was the butt of Russian media late night jokes.  Then, even if many Russians themselves supported democratic reform, few saw Navalny as any kind of real transformative figure or alternative to Putin.  Now, they take to the streets by the tens of thousands in every major city in Russia across Russia’s eleven time zones to demand his release.",geopolitics,Ukraine
123,"A Framework for Understanding Russian Politics, for Westerners",255.0,86xe1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/86xe1f/a_framework_for_understanding_russian_politics/,83.0,1521938817.0,"I think that for a lot of Americans or Westerners and especially American academics who only read what other Americans say about Russia, there's a tendency to form unrealistic expectations as a result of being locked in an echo chamber. The purpose of this post is to offer a more realistic framework for understanding Russian politics.

The conventional American view is that there is a ""state actor"" that is ""Russia"" which acts to advance ""Russian interests"", as if it were just that simple. While I am simplifying here, the typical Western academic response is that Russians just want to maintain their status as a great power, while preventing further Western ""incursions"" into the so called Russian sphere of influence (usually inclusive of at least the former Soviet bloc). Many Western academics buy into the idea that American and/or NATO withdrawing from Central Europe will pacify ""Russia"", who only act in retaliation to ""western aggression"".

The problem with this view is both philosophical and practical, and it begins with a failure to appreciate the actual dynamics of Russian politics. It is critical to understand that there is no such thing as ""Russian"" interests as they would be ineligible to Westerners. When Western academics speak of ""American Interests"" they are referring to items of consideration that at least indirectly if not tangentially benefit ""Americans"".

For example, the United States has an ""interest"" in establishing a military presence in the South China Sea to ensure relative peace and stability in trade, to facilitate the importation of consumer products manufactured in China. Even though this ""interest"" is a few degrees removed from a direct benefit to the American people, there is at least a rational or logical connection between the US Military taking some action and a collective benefit to Americans. People may -- and certainly do -- disagree with this notion, but the rationale still exists.

In contrast, consider the Russian military onslaught into Eastern Ukraine. The reason Russia invaded Eastern Ukraine had nothing to do with any direct or indirect interest to the Russian people. The claimed reason was to ""protect ethnic Russians"", but the reality was that un-uniformed Speznaz troops invaded Eastern Ukraine (and forced a plebiscite at gunpoint in Crimea), in violation of international norms and international law. There was no threat of any kind by so called ""fascists"" in Ukraine, because the only internal rebellion was sponsored by the Russian government.

However, there was a very compelling reason why Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and why he caused a civil war to be fomented there. Putin's interest was in preventing Ukraine from establishing formal diplomatic and trade relations with the European Union, as the people of Ukraine wished to do. The reason Putin sought to prevent this was because this would be perceived by Russians as a sign of his own weakness, for having lost control of what Russians correctly understand to be little more than a puppet-state of Moscow. That perceived weakness would legitimize challenges to his authority, by legal means or otherwise and thereby pose a risk to his ability to stay in power. This is, to Putin, a direct threat to his remaining in power.

In addition, for Ukraine to have established formal diplomatic and economic relations with Western Europe would have had the second order effect of preventing Putin from realizing his ambition of creating an economic trading zone similar to NAFTA throughout Central and Eastern Europe for the purpose of reducing Russian vulnerability to Western economic sanctions. If that objective is to ever be realized, Ukraine must be a part of it and if Ukraine is economically integrating with the west, and Russia allows that to happen, Putin risks every other country in Central and Eastern Europe following suit. Creating such an economic zone insulates him politically from the fallout of the kinds of sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia now, hence his interest in it.

To define interests of the Russian government as ""Russian"" would imply that Russian leaders are in one sense or another acting to advance the collective goals of the country rather than their individual goals in amassing wealth and power. The only interests that matter in Russia, at this time, are the interests of Vladimir Putin and his political allies. Every other individual's or group's interests are irrelevant. So, whatever we regard as ""Russian"" interests must be limited in scope to be inclusive only of those interests of Putin and his political allies. Putin's interest is in remaining in power. The same interest is shared by his political allies, who benefit from his status and position. As such, the ""Russian Endgame"" in the present is doing whatever is required for the current regime to not be overthrown.

This view is supported by an objective review of Putin's ""accomplishments"" since he has begun to hold office. When Putin ran for ""president"" so many years ago, his by-line was that he was going to do something like 'make Russia great again'. In many respects, he was the political beneficiary of the economic conditions inside Russia during the Bush Administration's middle eastern adventurism which resulted in skyrocketing global oil prices. But, since Obama was elected oil prices steadily dropped and they have never returned to the rate they were between 2002-2008. This has caused Putin to have to reevaluate his political strategy, which he has now re-focused towards emphasis on so called ""Glory Days"" of the Soviet Union's military legacy in World War II (or, as it is known in Russia, the Great Patriotic War). It turns out that military mythology and nostalgia are all Putin is willing to offer the Russian people, for so long as they will accept that instead of the collective benefit that might have been had from the profits of Russian state-owned or managed industry. In this way, he pacifies Russian citizens in such a way as to prevent them from rebellion while in the same instance creating conditions for his political allies to steal from the state that money which should have gone to the Russian people.

While doubtlessly there is corruption of various kinds throughout every country, including the United States and Western Europe, liberal Western democracies exist fundamentally for the benefit of their citizens. This is not the case in Russia, the government of which exists for the sole and exclusive benefit of those who have the power to steal from it with impunity. Preserving this status quo is what drives all decision-making in the Kremlin. Western people should not labor under the delusion that ""Russian"" interests are anything more than Vladimir Putin's interests, which are materially congruent to the interests of his political allies.

tl;dr there are no relevant ""Russian"" interests that have any bearing on decisions Putin or anyone else in Russian government makes outside those limited interests that advance the specific goals of Putin and his political allies.",geopolitics,Ukraine

The legacy of Saakashvili rule as President of Georgia will be disputed and discussed many years ahead. His role in the South Ossetian war, human rights abuses and abuse of power marks his second period, but there is also little room to doubt that Saakashvili was at least partially successful expanding the Georgia government capacity to rule and that he started transforming the little country east of Russia into one of the best places in the world to do business in and making the private sector one of the most solid ones in Europe.  Low levels corruption has almost been eradicated^(1) and it's now one of the best countries in the world to do business in. In that sense, it is not surprising that when Ukraine in 2014 looked for help in Georgia to transform their same country. However, 4 years later, the results have been disappointing (although not without some bright spots) and most of the Georgians involved has left Ukraine altogether.

Let us first us take a look at how Georgia transformed one of the poorest and most corrupt countries into an economic success story.

**The Rose Revolution**

The rose revolution^(3) started a new era for Georgia. The former Soviet minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze, who had been President for 8 years had to flee to Moscow, and along with him every Russian influence that there were in Georgian government.  Although in hindsight the revolution was a defeat for Russia, the reaction from Kremlin was lukewarm.

The story goes that Putin was actually at a Georgian restaurant in Moscow when Shevardnadze had called him, asking for help against the growing number of demonstrators. Putin allegedly was not up to date on the situation and sent the current minister of Foreign Affairs Igor Ivanov on the first plane to Tbilisi. He arrived there without any direct orders. When he left, Shevardnadze had interpreted the lack of commitment by Russia as a sign that he was left alone and surrounded his presidency.  He lived the rest of his days in obscurity and died in 2014 at the age of 86.

Russia had been displeased with Shevardnadze, with some of the old guard blaming him for the Soviet breakup by signing agreements that damaged Soviets interest when he was Foreign affairs minister.^(4) Also, while Georgia at that time was in the Russian geosphere, Shevardnadze had been a promoter of building an oil pipeline from Baku through Tbilisi to Ceyhan, bypassing Russia. Chechen separatist also escaped into Georgia in the 90s to avoid the Russian military. When all was said and done, no tears were shed in Kremlin. This gave Saakashvili a unique opportunity and playing room in the earliest months of his presidency. Russia and Georgia were on good terms until the orange revolution in Ukraine, where Saakashvili supported the protest.

**Saakashvili's playbook**

Saakashvili won the President elected in 2004 with 96 pct of the vote and started work immediately.  He hired young, talented people from outside the political pool. He hired the liberal economist (and some say a Ogliarch) Kakha Bendukidze as the new minister of economy, who was a big supporter of privatization, and started to go abroad to seek economic assistance for reforms.

Secondly, The government created a fund where Georgian businessmen pledged some of the fortunes to go to the reforms as an investment, until the tax revenue the government got could take over.

Third, with large support and the Soviet era opposition gone, privatization swept the country, lead by Bendukidze.  In 2005, the Georgian government reported over 1.4 bln dollar in income after the initial start of the privatization reform. Enough to cover government expenses for the whole of 2004.

However, the fourth and most important strategy was the seizure of private assets gained in corruptive deals. This point was also the factor that stopped progress in Ukraine, but more on that later. The system of Shevardnadze Georgia and today's Ukraine has a lot of similarities. Big deals from government went to whoever paid most under the table to the person in charge. People benefited from this got their private assets confiscated. From 2004 to 2005, it was estimated that around 1 bln dollars were confiscated and put back into the state budget. In the long, it also dismantled the oligarchy system^(t) and brought faith into international investors.

At the end of 2004, the money need for the reforms in juridical and police sector was provided, and the second part of the reforms was rolled out.

**A new police**

It started with a dismissal of 30.000 employees in the ministry of internal affairs (responsible for police, juridical system, and border patrols), half of them fired in a single day. To replace them came 20.000 cadets, who had salaries 5x the former police rate. The cadets were trained in new modern academies with Western European teachers and with access to top modern police equipment, sponsored by EU and the U.S.

The remaining old guards were put on desk duty, without the opportunity to take bribes, police cars from the Soviet era was replaced with modern ones, and police stations were built with glass facades to promote the transparency of the new police force.

The corrupt traffic police were disbanded and the Ministry of Internal affairs was reorganized into a more open and transparent organization.

Zero tolerance of bribery was heavily enforced. Sting operations against police officers were performed at high intervals, where even the smallest bribe was enough to arrest and publicly film the police officer on TV.  In about a year, the police had been reformed in such a degree that they were ready to fight the real systematic crime in the country.

**Human rights second priority against crime**

Although Georgia now had a weapon against crime and corruption, there were still big problems. There was a gigantic crime syndicate network operating, and the border guards still were as ineffective and corrupt as before Saakashvili. However, the country was to get a new best friend in the U.S President George W.Bush who in 2005 meet with Saakashvili and was applauded in front of 100.000 people in Tbilisi. ^(5)

Not long after, Georgia got large aid packages from the US, most of it earmarked to fight to smuggle of illegal arms and drugs into the Georgian border. New border station was built, off-track cars were acquired, modern training was provided, even helicopters were provided to the Georgian border guards. The state budget increased by the new expenses but was supported by the large GDP growth the country experienced.

In domestic issues, new questionable laws were introduced and threshold to arrest and sentence criminals was significantly lowered, filling the prisons. From 2003 to 2012 the number of incarcerated in Georgian prisons more than tripled, with many of them getting their human rights violated by abuse and torture while inside,

In 2007 the first fruits of these reforms were starting to establish. Petty crime and small-time corruption had almost been eliminated. People walked alone in the dark again in the streets of Tbilisi, street lights got repaired and parks got renovated for family visits.

In the bureaucratic sector, modernization and effectivization took hold. Many processes were put over the internet, cutting the red tape and cutting the numbers of public office workers. Things that could take up to 30 days to register, now was done in 30 minutes. The long lines at the harbors and border stops was removed as processing cargo was now taking a 10th of the time, supporting the GDP growth. From 2003 to 2007 the GDP on average passed 8 pct yoy,

**You die a hero, or see yourself become a villain**

We could have mentioned more about Saakashvili, on how 2007 became his year on top before the downfall. On how he established a power structure like the one in Russia with him on the top, on how he handled the demonstrations of 2007, and not at least his role in the South Ossetian war, however, that is for another time, no matter how he is perceived, the fact is that he was in charge when a small post-soviet country managed to reform  and how these reforms still hold to this day.

In that view, there is no wonder why he was hired to run the Ukrainian Odessa oblast in 2015 and how his Georgian peers were sought after to help change Ukraine.

***The Ukrainian start***

A common pattern in East Europe when it comes to reforming its police force is to change the name from the more military connecting word Militiya to Police... The Baltics reformed it as soon as they became independent in 1990, Poland changed its name at the same time. Russia changed the name in 2011 from the more military sounding name Militisya to the more acceptable Police, and it was the first thing Ukraine did when announcing the new reforms in 2015.^(B)

The word Militia itself might be to largely connect to the Soviet era and a natural place to start when you want to promote changes.

So in a large (and widely publicized) ceremony in 2015 the Ukrainian militias force was changed to the Ukrainian Police force. Dressed in western clothes and with photogenic cops taking selfies with the ordinary population, everything was set for a large scale reform seen like in Georgia.^(c)

It started good, the almost universal hated Traffic police was disbanded and replaced with the patrol police.  The patrol police were created from scratch in 2015-2016. The new employees were promised good conditions of work and a decent salary.  Most of the old guard was either sacked or put on desk duty, away from people they could demand a bribe from.

However, unlike in Georgia, the sacked police officers got the judicial system on their side.  Only about 8% of policemen were dismissed. Moreover, a large part of that 8 % got reinstated through court appeals and still patrols on this day.  Lets first start with the beginning.

**Making Odessa the new Batumi**

When Saakashvili was appointed as the Governor of Odessa Oblast in 2015, it was with mild enthusiasm from the Ukrainian people. Odessa was a big problem when it came to the corruption, especially as it had the country most important harbor.

When Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko appointed Saakashvili it was most likely because of the latter experience in fighting corruption and effective the bureaucracy to release some desperately needed money to the state budget, little did he know that Saakashvili had own political ambition and a potential future rival to both Poroshenko and his supporters.

What is learned afterward is that the Saakashvili method only works when the highest boss in the land is Saakashvili. To go mercilessly after the top players only work if you are on the top or have the backing of the one at the top. Saakashvili did not have that.

As Spiegel wrote^(6) Poroshenko was no rose revolutionary or staunch reformist, and he wasn't elected with 96 percent of the vote as Saakashvili had been in 2004. Poroshenko was a politician and businessman, a classic product of Ukraine's oligarchic system, in which every major business leader is also involved in politics.

While he started the first steps of his own playbook he soon discovered that Ukraine is not Georgia.  Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fessenko describes politics in Ukraine as a swamp, where abrupt movements are not possible, instead to get something done you need patience and support of the elite, a task not easy when the elite is in the center of corruption.

So it went like it did, after first getting some of the major decision reversed, the Georgian disappeared one by one from Odessa. As Poroshenko also saw Saakashvili getting political ambitition the deal was over. A little over a year after he started, Saakashvili resigned as Governor and got later his citizenship revoked.

&#x200B;

We often look at countries (and their leadership) here as geopolitical players pursuing core national interests. This is a very simplistic view however. It's no doubt clear to all of us that public opinion also plays a fundamental role in predicting how a country's leadership will act. In order to correctly predict Putin's decision to mobilize for instance, you need some understanding of how the Russian public would react to such a decision.

Now the obvious answer to that is polling data but polling data can be misleading. I've found in the last few years that direct interviews with citizens, where you hear them explain their logic, is often an equally meaningful barometer of what's going on there in the field of hearts and minds.

In the case of the Russian-Ukrainian war, when I have struggled to understand the Russian outlook, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/1420channel/videos) has been a great resource. He goes to different areas and asks Russians direct and sometimes probing questions about the war, the mobilization, Ukraine, etc...

Similarly, with the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, I'm skeptical that you can speak knowledgeably on the topic without either a) spending a lot of time in the region or at least b) spending a lot of time watching Corey Gil Shuster's excellent [Ask Project](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoreyGilShusterAskProject), where he takes questions from viewers and then films Israelis and Palestinians answering them.

What other channels/resources are out there like these? I would similarly love to hear how Chinese citizens discuss certain taboo subjects. Or Iranians. Even from the evasions you can learn a lot. And places where it's less dangerous are interesting as well. Like Greeks and Turks for instance. And what are Swiss people saying about Ukraine these days?

Obviously this is dangerous work in many places but to the extent that it exists, I think we should discuss it more. Thanks.",geopolitics,Ukraine

# Key takeaways

Russia's Invasion of Ukraine caused the manifestation of China's worst fears:


* **China's long-term strategy to divide West ruined; its regional situation worsened.**

* The West, its allies, and even the typically-neutral have reacted swiftly, firmly, cohesively. 

* Peripheral states (e.g. Finland, Sweden) given impetus to join West. 

* Similar banding by states in Asia now more likely. 

&nbsp;

* **China placed in diplomatic lose-lose situation.**

* Weeks before, announced Russian friendship ""without limits"", desire to change global order; invasion not during Beijing Olympics. 

* Widely perceived to have at least enabled invasion. Worried about looking more culpable to West and suffering similar consequences during a critical period for their development.

* Must avoid looking like an insincere partner while not incurring wrath of West. Increased headwinds and crosswinds regardless.

&nbsp;

* **Regardless of Ukraine's outcome, China's longer-term outlook much worse off.**

* Running out of time due to demographic crises, climate change, critical resource shortages (water), end of growth spurt, festering financial malaise. These converge in a few decades. 

* Country and military not developed enough right now so would rather bide for another decade or so to reach golden window of opportunity (relative power) before confronting current order. Invasion creates more friction against development, brings controntation forward.
 
* Gains from Russian victory completely overshadowed by awakening and hardening of West and allies and regional banding. Russia's stability in question due to sanctions.

* Ukrainian victory means further instability for Russia on top of strengthening confidence in current global order.

* Either way, increased political headwinds due to perception of at least some culpability in invasion. Viability of Russia as long-term insurance against issues mentioned jeopardized due to chance of regime change. If it overtly shuts down a pro-West change, West will strike very hard. Worst-case: Russia becomes part of West.


&nbsp;

* **Due to all of the above, covert action to escalate the conflict between Russia and the West would be in China's favor, even if it causes some damage to self, as geopolitics at this level is about relative victories.**

* Dual-circulation and zero-tolerance policies in-place provide groundwork for further insulation.

* Putin portrayed as unstable and underhanded, with his nuclear forces armed, and the country cornered by sanctions--fertile ground for covert instigation. No speculation on form of covert instigation as too many options and too early to say. 

* Some other countries have similar motivations, but it's the most motivated and capable.

* Direct intervention: Very unlikely to assist Ukraine invasion; likely to try to prop up Putin or maintain favorable regime.

# ""Crisis: Danger and Opportunity"" - China's geopolitical opportunity in the Ukraine Invasion

&nbsp;

After lamenting for years the disunity displayed by the West and its allies on a wide range of issues, the swiftness, determination, and cohesion in their reactions to the Ukraine invasion is relieving; even touching. However, the economic asphyxiation of Russia has only just begun, and there's no telling what a cornered beast might do, and how third parties might take advantage of this perception to play both sides. The latent danger lurking below the surface might be greater than most, even on /r/geopolitics, realize. This conflict is the biggest opportunity in a generation for some states to reverse their flagging fortunes at the expense of the feuding factions and everyone else, and both Russia and the West would do well to be on guard against this. As there is no shortage of pundits discussing the threat of opportunistic provocateurs, this short article will focus on analyzing one major power's potential motivations and touch on the opportunities presented by the unfolding situation.

&nbsp;

Putin's actions caused the materialization of China's worst fears. On top of uniting, galvanizing, and even growing the West, it placed China in a diplomatic lose-lose situation and jeopardized its long-term insurance by making a Russian regime change a distinct possibility. In my view, virtually all unattended outcomes of this conflict do not bode well for its long-term future.

&nbsp;

A prevailing Russia would lead some neighboring countries to question the point of the West and fall deeper into Russia's orbit while shaking global confidence in the post-WWII order. Though in line with the CCP's goals, the benefits are completely overshadowed by the strategic costs of binding and hardening the West's resolve--something that has been their core strategy for many years. A Ukrainian victory would further strain Russia while having the opposite effect of strengthening the current order. Whatever Ukraine's fate, the world is left with perceptions that China had, at the very least, unwittingly enabled the invasion, and this on its own can have consequences. The fact the invasion began soon after Beijing's Olympics doesn't help, as military plans don't typically yield for sporting events; neither does their declaration of friendship ""without limits"" that would build a new global order at the start of the event. Given what's at stake for the current order, it would mean stronger headwinds from more directions at a critical period. Realizing this, Beijing is desperately trying to walk a fine line to avoid being seen as Russia's enabler or branded a fickle, undependable partner; dancing around in crosswinds, desperately holding on to its fig leaf of credibility. Its Foreign Ministry, known for its combative Wolf Warrior diplomacy that at one point caused the PLA to tell Xi that [it wouldn't ""pay the bill""](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/p0nqla/chinese_pla_unwilling_to_pay_the_bill_for_foreign/), has been reduced to a troupe of tightrope walkers and contortionists, with Putin as the eccentric ringmaster.

&nbsp;

Zooming out to the bigger picture: From their perspective, they would want to bide another decade or so since China is still fragile and vulnerable, especially relative to members of the order it openly seeks to topple as the country and its military are not yet mature. They probably planned to assert themselves most during their golden window of opportunity, but the confrontation was brought forward by the invasion. This would be a major headache on its own, but there's more: The CCP know their age of growth will soon be over; replaced by an age of climate change, demographic crises (plural), and critical resource shortages (water)--to say nothing of the festering financial ills being exacerbated by the zero-tolerance policy it's stuck with. These seem set to converge within a few decades at most, and then it'd be as if the universe was collecting on its biggest debt. Things will be rough, but at least there's a friendly northern neighbor that can be counted on to act as a like-minded strategic ally, a massive land buffer, and a source of cheap, accessible, dependable natural resources (including water). Or so it was thought.

&nbsp;

One possible consequence of this war is a regime change--a possibility reserved not just for Ukraine, but also for its invader. With Russia being economically decimated by sanctions and Putin's oligarchs getting stripped, the stage has been set for Putin's departure; and with this comes the possibility of an overhaul in governance and allegiances. In my view, one of the few things stopping Russia from joining the West [is its leadership](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/lcmxhh/the_longer_telegram_toward_a_new_american_china/gm4ccby/). Its people, caucasian and culturally Christian, naturally gravitate towards the West--at least, more so than to China. I have [for years](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/g961ry/is_covid19_a_turning_point_for_chinas_role_in_the/fpc2ygp/) thought about a Russian regime change as being one of the lower hanging fruits for dealing with China, all stemming from basic [research](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/94rvly/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_china/) done [much earlier](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/96qp0n/series_geopolitics_and_climate_change_russia/), and this seems to be the future we're now heading toward. There's little the CCP can do to prevent this regime change once things go past the tipping point, as the West and its allies, now roused, would come down hard --very hard-- on any such attempt. If Russia follows its current trajectory unmolested and flips to the West, the CCP's future becomes that much more grim.

&nbsp;

The Chinese term for 'crisis' contains two words: 'danger' followed by 'opportunity'. The CCP knows it's in a bind and would be looking to make a move while the window of opportunity remains open.  A scenario that's better than the unattended alternatives is to come out on top, *relatively speaking*. Despite its growth having been derived from global trade, the country has been increasingly insular with its dual circulation strategy and zero-tolerance policy, so if the conflict between Russia and the West were to intensify without pulling in China (note the word use of the word 'conflict' instead of 'war'; not necessarily kinetic), that would be in its net favor. It is already under a lot of scrutiny and would want to avoid sanctions, so it must act covertly. And to a covert provocateur, the current situation would look like a buffet: A strongman characterized as unstable, cornered by sanctions; his country reputed to be underhanded, its nuclear forces on standby; the media in a frenzy, the internet rife with lies. All this within the first week of war, which could morph into years of resistance, while economic measures mature. Basically, the options range from ""manipulation of public discourse"" to ""economic shenanigans"" to ""false flag"" to ""suitcase nuke"" and combinations of everything in between, with proxies and intermediaries throwing off investigations just long enough.

&nbsp;  

With motive and opportunity established, people typically turn to the means to complete the triad, but I won't, simply because any speculation would just be creative writing since the possibilities are endless. I can, however, say with some confidence what *won't* happen: China will not meddle in Ukraine--providing funding and/or weapons to increase Russia's odds in Ukraine does little for its big picture while overt and costly. It's not so much Ukraine's fate that's China's concern, but Russia's. If anything they would try to prop up Putin, his regime, or an amicable successor's.

&nbsp;

I'm sure there are other states to which the logic presented in this short article also applies --they might even have stronger motivations and opportunities-- but within this subset of potential opportunists, it is China that's most motivated and poised. Hopefully all parties will remain vigilant, clear-eyed, and level-headed.

[Svetla Ben-Itzhak of the Air University argues](https://theconversation.com/space-blocs-the-future-of-international-cooperation-in-space-is-splitting-along-lines-of-power-on-earth-180221) that it is also having a flow-on effect on other areas that are not as prominent to the general public, and exacerbating trends that have been developing for at least a decade: ""Even during times of conflict on the ground, space has historically been an arena of collaboration among nations. But trends in the past decade suggest that the nature of cooperation in space is shifting, and fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted these changes.""

Forbes flat out describes it as a restarted space race. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not only changing the trajectory of European socio-geopolitical history, but also that of space development. In February, [Russia suspended ](https://eurasiantimes.com/russia-suspends-cooperation-with-nasa-on-venus-exploration/)a joint mission to Venus with NASA. And later the European Space Agency [canceled ExoMars, a joint project with Russia to search for alien life on Mars.](https://fortune.com/2022/03/17/mars-probe-russia-war-exomars-european-space-agency-mission-cancelled/) 

Potential militarization and/or politicization of extraterrestrial zones, particularly earth orbit and the Moon, is a very concerning trend and hopefully one that can be headed off at the past through diplomacy, and maintain space (and international waters generally) as a place of international competition rather than conflict. 

On the other hand, Forbes quotes Jordan Bimm of the University of Chicago: “Space is not this utopian, transformative place. Space is a place where all of our problems on Earth are reproduced or amplified.” 

The original space race was an outcome of both WWII and the Cold War, although technological limitations made it a largely impractical field for direct conflict. Rivalry tended to be maintained through symbolic acts such as launching Sputnik or the Moon landing. Since the end of the Cold War however, the number, complexity and range of functions of satellites and space stations has expanded dramatically, opening up opportunities for more direct engagement in space. 

Even before this latest war, Russia was going to [withdraw from the International Space Station before 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/a1518565-e643-42ae-a650-02e9c3bdd657). Roscosmos will build its own space station beginning in 2025. The sudden and dramatic isolation of Russia from the rest of world this year has also affected Roscosmos, so it is unclear if this plan is still going ahead.

146,Hypothetical geopolitical consequences of a post-Putin Russia,199.0,t47ha0,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t47ha0/hypothetical_geopolitical_consequences_of_a/,91.0,1646139875.0,"Greetings r/Geopolitics, with both oligarchs and average civilians now openly opposing Putin (very publicly as well), one of the scenarios that could potentially play out is some form of governmental change in Russia, be it a coup from generals worried Putin will take them past the point of no return, or a civil uprising, or anywhere in between.  


What I would like to discuss with the sub-reddit is what this could potentially mean for both Russia and the rest of the world going forward. A couple of scenarios that have occurred to me:

* Military coup - Generals take over, in which case ceasefire is declared with Ukraine in order to pull troops back to deal with any civil disobedience whilst the transition period takes place. We could then see a return to reasonable normality on the wider stage with Russia still aligned against the west and looking to gain support from China
* Civil democratic uprising - Dissent at home gains too much momentum to suppress, Putin is removed forcefully through whatever means and elections are held. The obvious candidate with public support is Navalny (assuming he survives). This would be the outcome that could shake up the world stage. If the west supports a fledgling democracy in Russia, along with economic and diplomatic incentives, we could see the security situation in Europe significantly improve. Perhaps if it lasts it would pave the way for Russia to join the EU once criteria are met. With a more docile Russia, we could see a dramatic shift of focus towards the South China sea and Asian region from the West. Perhaps this spotlight would be enough to dissuade China from its expansionist posturing, or maybe it would make them feel threatened enough to commit to larger military expenditure.

Obviously this is all speculation and if it falls outside the parameters of the subreddit then mods feel free to remove it, but its been something that has been in the back of my mind and I would love to hear some different takes on it.

The competing narratives:

**US/Ukraine:**

MH17 was deliberately shot down by Russian military units either from Russian or Ukrainian territory.

Evidence:

* BUK missiles are made in Russia
* Photos of Russian BUK missile launchers
* Photos/video of BUK missile launchers being fired
* Everyone knows that the Russian are a bunch of baby eating killers. What more proof do you need than that? /s

**Russia:**

MH17 was deliberately shot down by Ukrainian military units

Evidence:

* Ukraine has lots of BUK missiles
* Photos of Ukrainian BUK missile launchers
* Photos/video of BUK missile launchers being fired
* Everyone knows that the Ukrainians are a bunch of baby eating killers. What more proof do you need than that? /s

**Independent press, governments that are not the US, Russia or Ukraine:**

MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile battery captured from the Ukrainian army by pro-Russia separatists. The separatists believed they were firing on a Ukrainian military transport.

Evidence:

* Ukraine is a former SSR. Most of their equipment is Russian made. Including BUK's of which they have a lot
* During the first year of the Ukrainian conflict separatists made steady advances. Ukrainian leadership was in disarray, troops were demoralized and logistics were in chaos. Many Ukrainian units were overrun and their equipment captured. Including BUK's.
* Five years later I have trouble finding the same photo I saw in 2014. It featured a clearly marked Ukrainian army BUK manned by separatists not wearing uniforms. The photo does exist and their is no logical reason to believe it isn't true. I did find one image of a BUK with several individuals wearing camo jackets and blue jeans but it was unsourced so I don't know where or when it was taken.
* Prior to MH17 separatists shot down a Ukrainian military transport using a BUK. They proudly took credit for it and they were not contradicted by Ukraine.
* Immediately after MH17 was shot down, separatists announced over radio and social media that they shot down another Ukrainian military transport. They received many congratulatory replies. Until they got word to stop talking about it because maybe that wasn't a Ukrainian transport after all.
* Every nation with an interest in the conflict monitors radio communications in the zone. If the US NSA can keep a recording of every phone call I ever made then they have a transcript of those radio transmissions. The press was informed of tis in 2014 but later their sources clammed up as contradictory narratives arose.
* The credibility of the competing sources. From Polonium poisoning to ""weapons of mass destruction"", given the long history of demonstrably false narratives and propaganda from Russia and the US the obvious question is not whether they are lying but whether they are even capable of telling the truth.
* In truth, neither the Russians or Ukrainians are baby eating killers. Except for Andrei Chikatilo of course. Feel free to debate whether he was Ukrainian or Russian.",geopolitics,Ukraine

Given the Russian interference in the US election and intervention in Syria, and rapid modernization of armed forces, what is their strategic endgame here?  Is it a return to having a buffer zone against rival ideological powers (less ideological so these days, but still rival-ish) in the form of forcing Eastern European NATO countries to leave the alliance and ensuring a secure southern flank?  Expanding their political economic linkage to Iran and other Middle Eastern countries?  Is forming an oblast or actual part of Russia in eastern Ukraine on the agenda?  Or is Putin more or less beholden to oligarchic money and acting in the benefit of growing markets under the sanctions levied after the Crimea intervention?

Why? The U.S. has been, and continues to withdraw from the global economy. Shale oil has made the U.S. energy-independent, manufacturing is making a return to North American shores, and our economy is becoming less and less import/export based. (Even though imports/exports have never been more than %20 of GDP) China depends on those imports/exports heavily, and they also have a heavy old/young ratio. They are not in a good position to dominate any markets into the future either. Europes baby-boomers are retiring in droves. And they have an even higher retiree/worker ratio than the US does. Meaning most European countries are hitting the same problems the US is with Social Security, but worse. It was the baby boomers (both US and European) financial 401k investments that funded venture capitalism throughout the undeveloped world in otherwise unfeasible markets. Now that western boomers are collecting on 401ks and IRAs, the funding is getting turned mostly off. Most of western Europe's (with the exception of France) age demography is so skewed in favor of retirees, there is no way that their domestic workforces can fund pensions, even if the Bretton Woods era continued. Couple that with the decline in global trade, and there are not many western nations that are going sustain supplies in markets as simple as gasoline and grain. Europe will be poised to return to the pre-WWII status quo. Post WWII trade agreements like Bretton Woods are no longer useful to the US economically.  And since the US is losing economic interest globally, Americans will no longer be guarding shipping lanes, or funding new or existing markets. Exports-heavy Germany will no longer have markets to sell to. The UKs economy is primarily finance-driven. Poland and Ukraine will no longer have Western Europes or the US to support them against Russia. Being mostly resource-poor, most of Europe will go back to starting wars with each other for resources. (Which the author argues is the historical norm for Europe, the last 70 years of European peace an anomoly only made possible by US trade protections)The U.S, with its increasingly self-sustaining and isolated economy, abundant resources, and geographical isolation, will be getting involved in foreign conflicts MUCH less often, because we no longer have an economic interest in the markets that the wars are about.  In fact, the author foresees probable shutdowns of foreign bases in Korea, Germany amd the Middle East. At home, thee U.S. will feel an economic hit in niche markets, ""like out-of-season avocados"", and interest rates will likely double, (credit will become much harder to come by) but we won't be nearly as hard-pressed the rest of the developed/developing world. Our economy still possesses the ability to grow year by year, even if at a little slower pace. All in a mostly self-contained bubble.

This goes against the conventional wisdom that markets will become evermore global into perpetuity. It's turning my perspectives upside down. Any contradictory evidence to this theory I'm not thinking about? 

Title of the book is ""Accidental Superpower"" by Peter Zeihan.

TLDR; the global economy is poised to crash due to the US ceasing to participate in it in favor of domestic markets, and due to the global baby boomer generation retiring.",geopolitics,Ukraine

In order to compile my thoughts and maintain a ""big picture"" outlook on what is happening, I started to put together a series of notes that outline the situation as it unfolds. This post is one of those notes, focusing primarily on other countries and their response, interests and motivations in this crisis. 

Note, I am not advocating for either party, nor is this intended to be a fatalistic narrative. While it may seem that these thoughts are intended to paint a rather bleak picture, it is, to the best of my research ability, purely a strategic analysis of how the current crisis in Ukraine is interacting with core strategic interests of the regional powers of the world. I have taken great pains to remove any emotional, ethical or moralistic arguments because, quite frankly, I don't believe they are particularly helpful in analysing geopolitics. 

Please let me know what you think and what I have missed. I'd be happy with just thoughts and insights, but sources would be greatly appreciated. 

The United States is anxious about the threat of escalation in Europe because they have a far greater strategic interest in repivoting their military towards East Asia to check the Chinese over Taiwan, the South China Sea and reassure their allies in the region (thereby reinforcing their own security interests in the Pacific). 

This entanglement with European Affairs is complex, because the most logical focus for the United States from an economic, military and political perspective, is to reinforce their position in East Asia. Furthermore, there has been a tendency for European nations to step out of sync with Washington in recent years when it comes to foreign policy. This, coupled with the lack of the 2% GDP criteria for defence spending among NATO members, has resulted in the United States being spread thinly between its engagements in the Middle East and Afghanistan (though they have withdrawn, they will still need time to retool their army), their obligations in Asia and their maintainance of force in critical straits and trade routes around the world. Furthermore, while the US does not want a freeloading Europe, it is also not in the United States interest for Europe to federalise and develop a continental army, because this undermines the imbalance within NATO that ensures the United States a position of de-facto leadership of the alliance. As such, the United States is being forced to very carefully navigate this crisis in such a way that maintains their position in Europe without either losing influence among their allies in Europe or over committing at the expense of their allies in Asia. There is also an argument to be made that it is also in their interest to allow a non-existential (to the US) threat like Russia exist because it justifies and reinforces NATO, which affords the US enormous political leverage over the affairs of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. 

Western Europe has a long term strategic interest in maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia, not only due to a dependence on gas and oil (and not only for energy, but also for heating, on-selling and for oil based products) but also because the US intends to focus on Asia and Europe does not want to undermine decades of economic and social investment by reestablishing a continental military and introducing the uncomfortable question of greater federalisation of the European Union, which could result in a further fractioning of the currently profitable and relatively stable Eurozone. While Western Europe has been extremely willing to apply sanctions to the Russian's, many of their attempts at punitive economic measures have been relatively short lived and directed in a way that doesn't impact Europe's energy needs. This may change with the pausing of Nordstream and the renewed focus on alternative sources of energy, but that sentiment will need to stand the test of time and Europe has consistently shown that they are willing to forgive and forget where their immediate needs are concerned, if the 2008 war in Georgia or the 2014 annexation of Crimea is any indication. 

Eastern Europe has a *very* strong strategic interest in weakening the Russian State and maintaining a strong posture reinforced by a robust network of alliances. This is why you see the strongest foreign reactions to this crisis coming from Poland and the Baltics. However, they also have a historically proven imperative to refuse action unless the Western Powers are irrevocably committed. This is core to Polish Decision making and that is precisely why we see this game of hot potato being played with the Mig 29's that Poland promised to Ukraine. The West hailed the decision and promised to help in anyway they can. So the Polish refused outright to send the planes from their own territory. First it was to be sent to Germany, who declined, then to United States bases, who also declined. Therefore it appears as though the planes will remain in Poland for the time being. This is because Poland has developed a sort of national PTSD about being the first line of defense for the West, and they have integrated this trauma into their strategic foreign policy.

Southern (primarily South East Europe) Europe is desperately trying to avoid a war and maintain strict (real, not spoken) neutrality, because their economy is far more dependent on Russian Energy and Exports than that of Western Europe, and they are also very dependent on Western Economic Aid, Loans and Trade. 

The Turkish supported Ukraine immensely, right up until the beginning of this war. That is because Turkish interests aligned with Ukrainian interests during 2014-2019 (Turkey needed money to forestall an economic crisis, Ukraine needed military equipment from a non-Russia, non-US source, conveniently close to their port cities). However, the Turkish nations interest has always been vested in establishing itself as a valuable regional partner in the Black Sea, Eastern Med and Middle East. At the moment, support for Erdogan is faltering, much of its military is occupied with events in Syria and posturing against Iran, its economy is struggling and a significant portion of their gdp is dependent on Russian trade. Due to NATO and US support for the Kurds in Syria and South East Turkey, as well as 20 years of being denied candidate membership of the European Union, as well as the attempted CIA coup in 2017, the Turkish have a strong strategic interest in avoiding involvement, and this is evident by their lack of sanctions upon Russia, and their non-biased closure of the Black Sea to all non-Black Sea countries (of which Russia is the only one to maintain a fleet anyway). 

Both South America and the Middle Eastern powers have a strategic interest in maintaining their balancing act between Russia and the United States because recent history shows that both those powers proved that they are capable of intervening in local affairs, for better or for worse, and are willing to go toe to toe to compete for alliances and favourable regimes. See Syria and Venezuela for recent examples.

China has a strategic interest in maintaining the Russian State in its current form, as a cooperative and economically dependent Russia affords China a steady flow of resources, the ability to leave their northern border virtually undefended and the freedom to focus 100% of their attention on competing with the United States in the South China Sea. In so doing, they are also ensuring that the United States has to focus a great deal of resources and attention on maintaining its obligations to NATO, so that they have less ability and confidence to deal with the Chinese over the Taiwan issue. Perhaps China has a strategic interest in weakening the Russian State long term, but that is not in play at the moment because contributing to the strength of the Russian State directly impacts the far far far greater capabilities that the United States can bring to bear against China. 

East Asia is watching very intently here. For the purposes of convenience, I will lump Japan, South Korea and Taiwan together because they are all US allies who are currently uncomfortable with the notion of growing Chinese hard and soft power projection. For Taiwan, the growth of Chinese Power is rapidly approaching a point where Taiwanese Independence can be called into question. It is my analysis that East Asia is far more concerned with how the United States is reacting to this crisis, than as to what is actually happening in Russia and Ukraine. This is because the current strategic evaluation of these nations ability to resist China is underpinned by an expected level of support from the United States. A major mistep by the United States in Ukraine and in Europe, will have major ramifications on East Asia, either through over-comitting and emboldening China, or weakening their reputation and the *perception* that the US will deploy significant assets to support its allies. 

India's strategic interest lies with maintaining their balancing act between their social ties with the West, and their geopolitical ties to Russia and China. Historically, Russia has been a reliable ally to India due to both powers having very few conflicting interests and having overlapping economic needs (energy, raw materials, military equipment, in exchange for long term contracts, political support and manufacturing). Further, the Chinese and the Indians are anything but allies, with several competing interests. Without Russia, India is left in a far less negotiable position in Asian Politics as Russia is highly involved in neutralising the Sino-Indian rivalry (something the Russian's appear to have been quite desperately pursuing in the form of regional economic agreements and organizations). 

The former Soviet Union (excluding Ukraine and active members of NATO) has a strategic interest in maintaining neutrality for as long as possible and avoiding active commitment to either side because either way, their position will be strengthened by *not* getting involved. Russia under sanctions is likely to export their goods via subsidiary companies registered in their allies among the former Soviet Union, precisely what they did in Kazakhstan after the first round of sanctions in Georgia in 2008, then Ukraine in 2014. For them, waiting to see who emerges the stronger *locally* is more important than picking a side right now. Note, this is not to say that Russia will emerge stronger after this crisis, only that a Russian victory in Ukraine, closely followed by other international events that may occur, would mean that the former Soviet Republics in particular will be standing alone against Russia if they choose to support Ukraine prematurely, because if an intervention didn't happen in a definitely European country bordering NATO, it is highly unlikely to happen in Central Asia or the Caucasus. 

TLDR; Nations have interests, not feelings. Let me know if I missed any strategic interests pertaining to the crisis in Ukraine. I'd love if other regions were covered where gaps in my knowledge prevented me from including in this list! I've attempted to leave out seperate issues, except where the crisis in Ukraine is having a direct effect (such as China and the US's ongoing will they/won't they over Taiwan).

Edit: Regarding Turkey: The coup attempt took place in 2016, not 2017 as written above. Also, u/Tintenlampe has pointed out that Candidacy is actually the title of the official status granted to prospective EU members, much appreciated! I was using the term in the general sense. That said, Turkey has been a candidate for over 20 years now and the original point regarding the Turkish Leaderships position on the timeframes involved still stand.",geopolitics,Ukraine

We know that one of Russia's main concerns is the E.U and Nato expanding closer to Russia's borders, which Russia tries to counter by keeping some of the non-E.U buffer states under Russian influence, sometimes by force. 

But let's say in a hypothetical scenario, NATO is dissolved. E.U still exists and the U.S is still an E.U ally, but apart from current candidate nations (and only with Russia's approval), any further E.U integration stops.  The E.U and U.S would also not interfere or sanction Russia for any meddling in buffer states like Ukraine, Belarus etc.  Essentially I'm talking about a massive act of appeasement giving Russia free reign with the red line drawn at E.U borders.

This scenario removes most if not all the concerns that Russia uses to justify it's current foreign policy towards the west.

So my question is with NATO gone and no more E.U expansion and practically free reign on non E.U states (who'd be on their own ),  would Russia's current policy of interfering and keeping/expanding it's sphere of influence westwards still continue? To what point?  Or would it be more likely that Russia also drops the cold war games as well?  Any further annexations?

Most people probably don't know but at the same time, Venezuelans started a series of protests called ""La Salida,"" which were in response to the a contested (and likely stolen) presidential election along with worsening economic conditions.  The Venezuelan protests have failed to dislodge Maduro and conditions in Venezuela have gotten worse with a tighter controlled dictatorship than in 2014.  At the same time, Ukraine has started to progress on a more democratic path.  The 2019 elections were a good indication of that given that the anti-establishment candidate (Zelensky) was able to win in a clear landslide.

So I'm wondering why Maidan was successful while protests in Venezuela (and Hong Kong and Belarus and and Nicaragua and the Middle East) largely weren't.  What allows some protests to succeed in overthrowing an autocratic regime/ achieving significant reforms while others fail?  Does it have something to do with the culture of specific societies that make them more willing to fight/ take risks?  Is the level of autocracy important (i.e. was Ukraine at a specific sweet spot of weak autocracy which made it still possible to overthrow a wannabe dictator)?  Is there a specific formula for protests (i.e. decentralized and grassroots) that work better?

Russia's actions this election cycle can possibly be held responsible for some rather major hiccups in the American-Chinese relationship *(especially given how thin the margins were for the deciding states)*, and whether overtly or behind a the a scenes, I wonder how the Chinese elite are viewing Putin's game.

Also, I remember before 2014, that I heavily doubted a strong Russian-Chinese alliance because of their conflicting interests in Central Asia, predicting that Russia wouldn't take the ever-growing influence of China in Eurasian Union states like Khazakstan *(or proposed states, such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan & Mongolia)* lightly when it came at the cost of Russia influence, not to mention Russian weariness about becoming too dependent on China in general, but than of course Ukraine happened & Putin made his heavy turn to China to bolster his position against the West.

Although now, with the Trump wildcard back in play, I wonder if those aforementioned tensions will creep up again....

What I'm referring to of course is the idea that is the idea that a civil war which ""should"" be over is not over due to foreign backers. In Syria and Libya  Assad and Haftar have nearly ""won"" but cannot strike finishing blows due to the fact that 'the other side' is backed by Turkey, whom Russia does not want to alienate.

So in the end we have an almost permanent stalemate, with the civil war being over for most of the country, but due to external politics, cannot be finished off for good

176,Turkish Influence in Central Asia,128.0,soisau,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/soisau/turkish_influence_in_central_asia/,13.0,1644427221.0,"Turkey spent much of the 20th century building itself back up after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, striving to become the major power at the world's crossroads once again. Turkey's influence now extends wider than it has in decades, from the battlefields of North Africa to the slopes of the Caucasus, to the supply chains of Europe, and into the frontlines of Syria. In the country's pursuit of regional power however, there remains one more front they are still yet to gain deep influence in: Central Asia. 4 of the 5 former Soviet Central Asian republics have a Turkic background, and are striving to diversify their trading partnerships, but does Turkey actually stand a chance of being able to pull any of these republics away from the gravitational pull of Russia and China?

Many would argue that Turkey and its politicians desire to live up to a historical regional legacy, and this can be seen through the country’s efforts to gain influence in a number of its neighbouring regions. Most obvious is its involvement in the Middle East, where it has played a role in the Syrian conflict in particular over the last decade, cementing its role as a regional power who must be at the table for future decisions. This model of intervention has played out somewhat successfully for Ankara in both Nagorno-Karabakh, Libya, Somalia and in Syria, and is looking like a possible model to be refined in their other neighbouring regions, including North Africa, South-Eastern Europe, the Caucuses, and Central Asia.

To quickly look at North Africa for context, Turkey has been a large presence in the Libyan civil war, with its drones and mercenaries being instrumental in a number of key battles throughout the country, even on occasion going head-to-head with Russia’s own proxies and drones. In Southeast Europe, their primary focus has recently been on Ukraine, with Ankara being very outspoken against Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, and rapidly expanding the scope of its relationship with Kyiv. This has included limited defence cooperation, where the two are working together on naval construction and some aspects of operations, as well as aviation engineering, and critically, Turkey’s drone program. In the Caucuses again Turkey’s drones were immensely powerful in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the relationship between Ankara and Baku is extremely strong.

So where does Turkey’s interest in Central Asia come from, and what role is it trying to carve out for itself in a region dominated by Russia culturally, and China economically? A number of the experts we interviewed for the piece seem to pinpoint its origins at Turkeys snubbing by the EU, and their failure to meaningfully advance toward EU membership or closer ties with the European Union in the early 2000’s, with this snubbing becoming the major catalyst for the countries decision to pivot away from Europe and toward the Middle East and Africa. With the roads into Europe becoming increasingly stonewalled by the EU, Erdogan seems to be throwing his weight behind the countries “*Look East* “ doctrine. This change in national doctrine precipitated Turkey’s increased roles to its South and East, and brings us to where we are today.

Ankara is hoping to use its Turkic cultural connections as a conversation starter to begin relationships with a number of these Central Asian republics, and possibly act as the republics gateways into Europe for the sale of their vast energy resources. For this reason, Matthew Bryza argues that there is nostalgia and cultural influence in its decision to try and establish itself in Central Asia, but underneath that is increasingly economically unstable Anakra desperate for additional revenue streams.

It should be said though that when travelling through this region of the world it is still incredibly evident that Moscow's roots are still embedded deep into the ground, and Russian is still the Lingua Franca of the region. Poll after poll in the majority of the Central Asian populations shows a preference toward Moscow over Beijing, even though China regularly outspends Russia in parts of the region. Ankara is hoping this penchant for cultural affinity over economic stability could work in Turkey’s favour and act as a future blueprint for improving its ties with the regions inhabitants.

Although still below a majority, Russia and China have seen a slightly growing populist opposition to them in the Central Asian states in recent years, and Bruce Pannier argues that Turkey could sidestep this opposition because of the historical and cultural connections that it has in the region. As such, Turkey aims to either create a role just for itself, or work with Russia and/or China on projects to be the more acceptable face of various efforts to increase influence in the region. Ankara is well aware of its minor economic weight compared to Moscow and China, but there is hope in the Turkish foreign policy circles that the country could gain enough influence to become the balance of power in the region, encouraging Bejiing and Moscow to cooperate with Ankara to maintain stability in Central Asia.

Despite this, Russia’s influence should not be underestimated, and while Turkey’s military export business is strong, Russia is a step above and will remain critical for regional security, especially following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Turkey though is trying to make inroads in the regions arms industry, and just in recent months we have been seeing a step up in Turkeys sales of drones to Krygyzstan, and the deploying of military advisors into the country. Last April we saw conflict break out in the border areas between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, leaving around 50 dead. The same area along the border is now heating up again, with Kyrgyz nationalists renaming ethnicly Tajik towns to Krygyz names in a direct provocation of the Tajik population. Some analysts in the region worry that Turkey may look to support Bishkek in a similar way it assisted Azerbaijan in the Karabakh conflict, something almost everyone agrees was largely responsible for the Azeri victory in the war. Turkish influence here in Central Asia though risks the conflict widening and drawing other regional players like Iran, China and Russia in, so Ankara is being warned to proceed with caution in its dealings with Kyrgyzstan. Because of this, Turkey’s growing roles in its many neighbouring regions will be important to keep an eye on going forward, as they have the potential to be very influential military, politically, and even economically.Turkey still has a long way to go before it can ever hope to legitimately muscle out Russian or Chinese influence in these countries, but I also think they are an entity in the region that should be watched carefully. If there is a conflict on the Tajik border, and Turkey does play a major role, or Turkey builds the pipeline infrastructure to connect the Turkmen gas fields to the European markets across the Caspian, or they simply provide major funding for Turkic nationalist candidates in some elections, Ankara may actually be on its way to the long shot of becoming the balance of power between Russia and China in the region.I would love to get this subs thoughts on the subject though.

Will Turkey move to militarily back Krygyzstan in the event of another war with Tajikistan?Will Ankara have the finances to build meaningful infrastructure in the area, or are they already vastly overstretched? And with Turkey now prosecuting Turkmen activists protesting in Istanbul, will be see backlash against Ankara from the general populations of these countries?If youre interested in checking out the full piece on *“Turkish influence in Central Asia”* we put together a fortnight ago withALEX KOKCHAROV >> Principal Research Analyst at IHS Markit, and a specialising in Ukraine, Russia, and the former Soviet States

178,"Ukraine military, now vs then",123.0,a16jm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/a16jm6/ukraine_military_now_vs_then/,57.0,1543414395.0,"As the Crisis in Crimea is getting warmer i think its worth taking a look at Ukraine and where they stand now military in a conflict against Russia. Lets first start with the obvious one:

Ukraine has a completely different military than they had in end of 2013. No question about it. Lets first take a look on pre-2014 crisis.

**Before 2014: In dissarray**

According to Foreign Research Policy in 2013 the Ukraine could fully support only one battalion of 10.000 soldier in a military operation. When the annextion of Crimea happened the Ukraine was helpless in any situation. Although it is to be mentioned that they were extremely close to stop the insurgency in Donbass, until Russia started sending soldiers in. However this was done by mostly volunteer battalions.

Since then Ukraine has adopted itself into a new fighting force. New doctrines was written and new reforms was implemented. From going to a unequipped, non-trained force of 160k, they now boost a 250k strong army with almost full support to conduct military operations. Furthermore the dreaded conscription is being phased out with a professional army,

Increased funding has helped Ukraine significantly boost both the volume and combat-readiness of its troops. Since 2013, the number of military personnel has risen 36% to 250,000.

This is particularly notable as the Ukrainian army gradually abandons its unpopular draft and moves to a contract service model. According to official plans (it was approved in 2017), by 2020, up to 80% of servicemen will be professional soldiers.

Furthermore the doctrines is now integrated to NATOs, meaning that western powers provide training and equipment for the Ukrainan forces.

**Reorganization in good way**

The Ukraine military has created units for information and psychological special operations/propaganda/counter information units and has reformed its territorial defense system. Today, in each region of the state, formed units of territorial defense are based on reservists, volunteers, and demobilized soldiers.

By the end of this year, these units will be reorganized into battalions and consolidated into brigades, which will be managed by the command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of the Ukraine. The next stage will be the training of brigades in accordance with the standards of the NATO.

This will make it much more easier for NATO to provide Ukraine with support in potential conflict. It also has streamlined assets and manpower, making the chain of command much more efficient.

**The rise of the special forces:**

Before 2014 the Special Forces of Ukraine was seen as brutes, more likely to break up protest than doing high risk missions for the defence of the country. Like many post-war states they had the Spetnaz structure where different groups was loyal to different bureaus. After Maidan 2014 many of them was disbanded and several of them shifted side. The most infamous of them was the group Berkut, who was disbanded right afterwards, with many of the members escaping to Crimea.

After 2014 the special forces operated in seperatist areas.  During the fighting in and around Donetsk Airport in 2015, Kremlin-supported forces dubbed the Ukrainian defenders, which included members of the 3rd Spetnaz Regiment, as inhuman “cyborgs” for their tenacity. They only abandoned their positions after repeated artillery bombardments and assaults with tanks and other armored vehicles.

In 2016 the Special Forces commander went to Germany where he meet with U.S leader of Special Forces. Although spare with details, US has provided the special forces with equipment and training. U.S instructors has been training them, and new non-lethal equipment like modern uniforms and drones has been sent to Ukraines special forces.

However, both Obama and Trump administration has been hesitant to send more lethal equipment to Ukraine as it might move the balance of power, escalating the situations. However the Trump administration have approved sales of Javelin missiles and is less likely to be restrictive of U.S weapon support. 

**The gamechanger**

Russia is planning on building their ground forces around the Armata Universal Combat Plattform. A next generation plattform of Tanks and armored vechile where there are few countermeasures against. The system is already in place in a limited scope of the Russian military forces, but would be used for a campaign.  T

he Active Protection system that is installed in the plattform, which can reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank guided weapons and RPGs by two-thirds, making it almost indestructable. (Some analyst speculate that the ratio of ellimination with other tanks can be as high as 10/1)

Since 1916, the biggest threat to tanks has been, not other tanks, but ambush by hidden anti-tank weapons — from repurposed field guns in World War I to specialized *panzerjäger* vehicles in World War II to shoulder-fired rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles today.

If Ukraines Anti-tank squads will not be able to stop Russian tanks, they have already lost the war. Thats why its of vital importance for Ukraine to have access to a countermeasure. The most relable one yet is the FGM-148 Javelin which Ukraine bought around 200 of in early 2018. If Ukraine can stop and disable a large number of Russian tanks it can be the breaking point of the war. (Not to mention that the Armata plattform is extremely expensive, with speculation on how many Russia actually can financially support)

While we are in the topic of tanks...

**Updated armor:**

The biggest problem that former Sovjet states had after the breakup was the huge arsenal of tanks left. Many of the countries used the leftover tanks as a backbone for the new national armies, but as time passed and they broke down without being replaced. From 2014 there has been a replacement of armor and cars to provide assets for the next 10-20 years. Although not enough to combat Russia head on there, there is enough tanks and APV operational for military operations of a larger scale. However, Ukraine meet some setback here. The Humwee delivered from US provided not up for the task of Ukrainian terrain, creating the need for resources to modify those. The second problem is that Ukraine has little money to develop and create more tanks for a full on defense.

**Logistics:**

In 2014 the biggest problem was that Ukraine had nothing, now it can be said that they have too little. Before the logistics line was dependended on voluntary contribution from society. F.ex food, warm clothes was needed to be donated from private persons. Now the soldiers has a more streamlined logistics line. Food is delivered in standard MR and uniforms for all weather has been bought in. Here is a example of clothes bought in in 2017 alone:

*kevlar helmets – 18.000 items; 	body armour vests – 1.000 sets; 	Service uniform – 20.000 sets; 	field hats – 173.200 items; 	helmet liners – 150.000 items; 	summer field uniform – 308.000 sets; 	cold-weather field jackets – 146.600 items; 	cold-weather field trousers – 87.600 items; 	combat boots – 327.200 pairs; 	short-sleeved vests – 180.000 items; 	knit cold-weather undergarments – 210.300 sets; 	knit undershirt – 304.500 sets.*

Gas trucks and mobile kitchens has also been bought and a Ukrainian field corps has been given a field hospital and training by germans for medical support. 17 trucks with the capacity to perform electronic warfare was bought in along with 20 state of the art combat performing ambulances.

**Training:**

Ukraine has performed 238 training activites in 2017, with more than 300 i 2018, combined with live combat experience in Donbass has made the Ukrainian military more combat ready and better equipped. Salaries has been increased and the morale is seen to be on higher level than in 2013. Although not yet gone, the dependency on volunteer batalions has dimmished the last years.  The Armed Forces of Ukraine turned around a disastrous situation in the 2014 conflict thanks to the help of volunteer fighters. But even after an active process of absorption, their full integration into the regular army remains maybe the biggest challenge. Conclusion: Its far away from the anarchy of 2014, but there are still challenges ahead to create a NATO standard streamlined command.

**Future needs:**

Although the Ukraine is better off supporting the ground troops, there is still a large demands in the air-segment and in the navy. Ukraine have only one corvette and one fregate to protect their shores, which is impossible against Russia presence in Crimea. Plans to build 4 fregattes and buy  Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate from US is in the works but will not be active for many years.

In the land department Ukraine has requested to buy US [Patriot](http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23351/ukraine-requests-to-buy-patriot-missiles-as-it-delivers-a-mobile-radar-to-the-u-s-army) systems to combat a superior russian air force.  As with the Armata tanks, the most efficient counter measure against russian Iskander missile system comes from the US. A defence against Iskander that is stationed in Crimea will be a large setback of Russian military plans that heavily is supported by the system.

**Conclusion:**

Ukraine has not wasted the time after 2014 but some will question that they could be more efficient. Corruption is still a mayor problem and the country is outpowered on air and sea. Although we most likely would seen Russian success in a land combat also, the price would be more heavy than 4 years ago as casualties would be high. The highest risk is now lack of money and sabotage within.

First, let me begin by saying that my knowledge of Belarusian, Rusian and Ukrainian internal politics is very limited. This is why I want to open this discussion and learn about the opinion of people more knowledgeable than me.

To get a good run down on the critical situation in which Belarus finds itself I recommend this piece: [http://waidelotte.org/lukashenkos-penultimate-elections/](http://waidelotte.org/lukashenkos-penultimate-elections/)

In the last days, two candidates for the upcoming Belarusian elections next 9th of August were barred from participating. The candidates, Valery Tsepkalo had some paperwork nullified and Viktor Babariko was found guilty of politic crimes shortly after announcing his candidacy. With the opposition out, Aleksander Lukashenko, “the last dictator of Europe”, is expected to win an overwhelming majority in the elections in two weeks. These events led to pro-democracy protests in several cities, which ended with between 250-300 arrests and several wounded. The protests, from what I can tell, seem to have slowed down in the last days.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election/hundreds-protest-in-belarus-after-two-main-challengers-barred-from-election-ballot-idUSKCN24F10W](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election/hundreds-protest-in-belarus-after-two-main-challengers-barred-from-election-ballot-idUSKCN24F10W)

Lukashenko was tolerated, even loved, during his 26-year rule because he brough prosperity to the country. But that is no more. Economic situation is stagnant or worse. Relations with Russia are in a terrible deadlock in which Russia suggests outright ownership of the country in exchange for economical improvements.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-oil-russia-lukashenko/russia-hints-at-belarus-joining-it-in-a-unified-state-in-exchange-for-oil-deal-lukashenko-idUSKBN20815V](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-oil-russia-lukashenko/russia-hints-at-belarus-joining-it-in-a-unified-state-in-exchange-for-oil-deal-lukashenko-idUSKBN20815V)

While Lukashenko would never give his country to Russia, this is proof of the great interest that Russia has in Belarus. 70 % of the Belarusian people speak Russian at home, while only 23 % speak Belarusian. Take a look at the language map. Eastern Belarus speaks mostly Russian, while the central part speaks mostly Belarussian.

[http://languagesoftheworld.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Belarusian-Language-Maps.png](http://languagesoftheworld.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Belarusian-Language-Maps.png)

The protests in the last days seem to have been suppressed, but I do not think the economic situation will improve since Lukashenko and Putin seem to be in a love/hate relationship and the economic recession from COVID has just begun. Regarding democracy, I do not think the people of Belarus will have fair elections as long a Lukashenko is in power. Therefore, I would expect that protests could only get worse from here on.

Regarding national identity, many Belarusians would not mind being part of Russia, specially those living in the East. However, Belarusian identity has been on the rise in recent years, even promoted by Lukashenko himself. In the last years, support for a union with Russia has decreased, while support for joining the EU is increasing.

[https://belsat.eu/en/news/number-of-belarus-russia-union-supporters-falls-by-third-poll/](https://belsat.eu/en/news/number-of-belarus-russia-union-supporters-falls-by-third-poll/)

To anyone familiar with the Ukraine situation pre-2013 this would all sound very similar. So, here is my main question: **Could a pro-democracy movement in Belarus lead to a conflict with Russia similar to what happened in Ukraine in 2013?**

What if, due to economic stagnation and a stronger national identity, Belarus starts to move away from Russia. What if a pro-democracy movement succeeds in removing Lukashenko. Will Russia allow Belarus to drift away from its control? Will Russia repeat the same strategy it employed against Ukraine in 2013 and attempt to annex the most “Russian” parts of the country?

If so, how can this be avoided?",geopolitics,Ukraine
181,How big of a problem (for China) is the PLA's lack of contemporary warfare experience?,120.0,tax2n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tax2n2/how_big_of_a_problem_for_china_is_the_plas_lack/,90.0,1646913346.0," Over  the past few days, I have seen a lot of comparisons of Ukraine's war  with Russia and the future presumed invasion of Taiwan. And it has got  me thinking of the People's Liberation Army's experience in war, and if  they have the capability to actually occupy Taiwan by the way of a  large-scale invasion. From what I can tell military experts are baffled  at Russia's apparent ineptitude. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems  like this war has not played out how most people expected. The consensus  seems to offer several explanations: Russia's failure to take out  Ukrainian Air Defense and establish air superiority, troops being  stranded from the main force, running out of food and gas, broken and  unreliable equipment, abdication of the information space (this one  seems mostly due to how they framed the war internally, but not an  expert and not sure if they have had any propaganda wins), betting on  the West not responding as forcefully as we have, etc.

&#x200B;

My  question is: are any of the issues that Russia has faced so far  possibilities that the PLA will have to contend with? From my brief  research, besides participation in the war on terror (How involved are  they in this?) and some border skirmishes with India, the last war the  PLA participated in was the Sino-Vietnamese War and subsequent conflicts  (1979-1991). While Russia's military has seen a lot more recent combat  experience in Syria, but even with this recent experience the Russian  military seems to have underestimated an opponent that's backed by most  Western Governments (Ukraine has obviously risen to the occasion as  well). Would that not be the case for a Sino-Taiwanese War as well? The  US seems to have more strategic interests in Taiwan (Chips, Access to  the South China Sea, and acting as a barrier to China's access to the  Pacific). Because of these interests I'd imagine that the US would be  more willing and forceful in its support for Taiwanese Defense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I suppose my post can be boiled down into several questions.

&#x200B;

How competent is the PLA assumed to be?

Does not having contemporary military experience make the PLA less capable? and to what degree?

What military capabilities does China have that Russia doesn't?

Does the different cultures of Russia and China contribute much to the efficacy of their military's?

In  the event of the invasion of Taiwan, how involved would Western  governments, and specifically the US, get? More or less so than Ukraine?

How does Taiwan's military compare to Ukraine's?

What other regional powers would get involved? Japan? South Korea? Others?

How  does the intense economic interdependence of the US's and China's  economies alter the calculus of determining when/if to invade? (I am  fairly sure this question warrants a whole different discussion)

Both of the larger countries want these states back in an effort to peddle their narratives of cohesion and legitimacy to their populations.

I’m not sure if the Ukraine invasion is the best example,  but say any geopolitical issue between countries that’s got big public spins attached to it  say when Bush was calling european leaders to support the invasion of Iraq and remove Saddam citing WMD terrorism  9/11  etc,  but its really about finally get rid of Saddam and install a pro western government for geopolitical reason xyz.

By all means, critizise Germany for its policies, but do so from an informed point of view and don't divide the free world with conspiracy theories arguments not based in facts.

There is a lot of nuance to Germany's foreign policy and it cannot be understood without proper historical context. I am *not a historian nor a political scientist,* only a German citizen presenting his view on German politics. I am simplifying German history and politics here in order to give an explanation for Germany's position. In order to do justice to the historical context, this unfortunately still needs to be a long read.

**Ostpolitik**

At the start of the 1970s Germany still is an international pariah for their crimes in WWII. We are in the midst of the cold war and tensions between east and west are high. The rest of Europe wonders: If given the chance, would Germany become fascist again and reconquer the territories they lost after WWII?

In this time, the west german chancellor Willy Brandt decides a radical new policy towards Eastern Europe, the [neue Ostpolitik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostpolitik):

* He visits the countries on the other side of the iron curtain and publicly acknowledge the shame of all the suffering Germany is responsible for.
* Germany would denounce claims to any territory they lost in WWII.
* Finally, Western Germany would aim to normalize their relationship towards the east by the means of diplomacy and by deepening trade with Soviet Russia.

This new policy not only reassured Europe, that they need not fear Germany anymore but also served to de-escalate the tensions between the East and the West. These ideas of de-escalation, trade and diplomacy would be the basis of German foreign policy up until 2022.

**Pacifist and anti-nuclear movements**

During the cold war, the front line between NATO and the Warsaw pact went right through Germany. If the cold war ever got hot, Germany would be the first to suffer. The American nukes stationed in Germany and the inner German border would be a constant reminder, that Germany could become a nuclear wasteland, if tensions escalated.

This fear of nuclear annihilation resulted in large pacifist and anti-nuclear movements, which merged into [The Greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens), one of the now major political parties in Germany. German policies and public opinions of the last decades are heavily influenced by this pacifism and anti-nuclear sentiment.

**The 90's and demilitarization**

At the end of the cold war, Western Germany had one of the biggest armies in Europe with half a million active soldiers ([source](https://www.bundeswehr.de/en/about-bundeswehr/history/cold-war)). Per capita, that is about twice as much as the USA has today. Add to that about 150,000 soldiers of the [Eastern German army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_People%27s_Army).

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Germany is surrounded by friendly democracies. At first, even Russia seems to be on a democratic and non-aggressive path. All this expensive military now seems to be unneccesary. The public becomes disinterested in military affairs and the governments let the German army decline further and further.

The state of the German army is a well known problem in German politics, which is not solved by simply increasing the budget to 2% of GDP. The German army needs reforms, for instance because of innefficient bureaucracy and costly purchasing policies ([german](https://www.rnd.de/politik/wenn-soldaten-mit-dem-bully-uben-mussen-statt-mit-dem-panzer-JEJZCRFX2BFONHIT74HQBWOROI.html) [sources](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/beschaffung-bundeswehr-101.html)). The conservative German governments (2005-2021) under Angela Merkel failed to tackle this issue whilst claiming to be the party of the German army.

**Aid for Ukraine**

The Ostpolitik of the 70s introduced a new policy on weapons exports. Germany would not send any weapons into a conflict zone ([source](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/cocoon/barch/1000/k/k1971k/kap1_2/kap2_21/para3_4.html#Start)). Germany did not want to be responsible for escalating and increasing the suffering  in the world and the proxy wars of the 70s and 80s confirmed this view.

This policy became a mantra of German politics and would mostly be observed to this day. Public opinion before the Russian invasion agrees with this policy with 38% wanting to restrict weapons export to NATO and EU countries ([source](https://taz.de/Umfrage-zu-Ruestung-und-Waffenexporten/!5814233/)). This is the main reason Germany was so hesitant to send weapons to Ukraine before the invasion.

After the invasion, German policy and public opinion took a U-turn and with [public approval](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend/deutschlandtrend-2925.html), Germany now sends weapons to Ukraine. Still, relative to its size, Germany does not send as much weapons as other countries. Years of budgeting reduced Germany's stockpiles to a bare minimum and more complicated weaponry cannot easily be used by Ukraine.

While being hesitant to send weapons, from 2014-2021 Germany provided a huge amount of economic aid to Ukraine totalling about [€6 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War#cite_note-:zdf-77), much more than most other countries.

**Germany's relation to Russia**

In 2012, the European Union was awarded with a Nobel peace prize for its contribution to peace and stability in post-WWII Europe. Integration and economic interdependence is one of the main contributing factors for this achievement. From the 1970s onward, Western Germany aimed to extend this idea to Soviet Russia and [started importing natural gas](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch-sowjetische_R%C3%B6hren-Erdgas-Gesch%C3%A4fte) from the Soviets.

In the 90s and early 2000s, hopes for a democratic and peaceful Russia  were high in Germany. In Putin's first term, he and the German chancellor of the time, Gerhard Schröder, developed a friendly relationship. Schröder even called Putin a [""flawless democrat""](https://www.abendblatt.de/politik/deutschland/article106930893/Schroeder-Putin-ist-lupenreiner-Demokrat.html) in 2004. Economic ties were deepened, including plans for a new pipeline, [Nord Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream).

After Schröder lost the 2005 to Angela Merkel, Schröder became Chairman of the Nordstream company and of the Russian gas company Rosneft ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der)). For this he is heavily critizised in Germany and following the Russian invasion, the public calls for him to resign his positions and be excluded from his party.

The government of Angela Merkel, while being critical of Russia, continued to deepen economic ties with Russia and in 2011 approved plans for an additional pipeline, Nordstream 2. Germany was convinced that economic integration helped maintain peace in Europe. Nobody would be so incredibly stupid to destroy their economy by starting a war in Europe.

Unfortunately, somebody was so incredibly stupid.

**Dependency on gas and the nuclear question**

Germany imports about 55% of its natural gas from Russia, although this claim [may not be reliable](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/wirtschaft/oel-und-gas-aus-russland-wie-belastbar-sind-die-zahlen,SzfroYO). Ukraine and other international actors demand Germany stop these imports, but Germany refuses to do so for now. This is not about the price of gas. Oil and coal can easily be bought on the international market, but gas needs infrastructure like pipelines and LNG terminals. Germany lacks this infrastructure.

The megaminds of Reddit are wrongly convinced that Germany just needs to go nuclear again and the phaseout of nuclear energy in Germany is the sole reason for this problem. [Only about 14%](https://www.equinor.de/de/einsatzbereiche.html) of gas in Germany is used to generate electricity and gas and gas-generated electricity is about [15% of total electricity](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economic-Sectors-Enterprises/Energy/Production/Tables/gross-electricity-production.html). Gas is mainly used for heating homes and industrial processes, both of which cannot simply be replaced by electricity. Stopping this industry would have [catastrophic consequences](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/oel-und-gas-importstopp-industrie-warnt-vor-dramatischen-folgen-17870139.html), not only for Germany.

How much does the nuclear phaseout enter into this dependency on gas? Barely. The main purpose of the 14% of gas used for electricity is to deal with [fluctuations of renewables](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/energie/kraftwerke-konventionelle-erneuerbare#kraftwerke-auf-basis-konventioneller-energietrager). Nuclear reactors cannot easily serve this purpose. Also note that Germany has been a net exporter of electricity for the [last 20 years](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/153533/umfrage/stromimportsaldo-von-deutschland-seit-1990/). The nuclear phaseout did not significantly increase the reliance on Russian gas and simply was a popular decision. The anti-nuclear movement in Germany steadily rose in popularity since the 70s and after Fukushima, [more than 80%](https://www.infratest-dimap.de/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/dt1104_bericht.pdf) of Germans wanted to phase out nuclear Energy by 2020 or even earlier.

The long-term goal is to replace natural gas with [hydrogen](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Publikationen/Energie/die-nationale-wasserstoffstrategie.html) produced with renewable energy, where necessary. The last 16 years of conservative-led governments by Angela Merkel did not make significant steps in this direction and also slowed the transition to renewables, for instance by [crippling the German solar industry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/02/germany-cuts-solar-power-subsidies).

**Final notes**

Germany's Russia policy of the last 16 years is not a result of greed, corruption and collusion with Putin, but rather a continuation of general German policy of the last 50 years. Germany is one of the countries with the [highest median age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age) and political change is slow. 16 years of government by mostly the same ruling parties and the same chancellor add to that.

Following the Russian invasion, the current German government under Olaf Scholz announced to break with 50 years of German foreign policy and wants to rearm Germany. Public opinion also changed heavily and the change in policy is supported [almost unanimously](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend/deutschlandtrend-2925.html) \- in a democracy, which was previously dismissive of such changes and where almost any political decision is critizised and faces opposition.

**IR Theory**

---

Q) You have claimed that your theory can explain roughly around 75% of the events in international relations. No theory can explain everything, so my question is if you think that a theory of foreign policy or a decision-making theory complements your theory in a meaningful way?

A) I cannot prove it, but my intuition is that our best theories can explain roughly 75% of the events which are applicable to that theory. The reason why the explanatory power of any social science theory is limited is that the world is exceedingly complex, and what theories effectively try to do is simplify that complicated reality by focusing on just a handful of key factors that are thought to be important for making sense of that complex world. In the process of developing any theory, a number of other factors get left on the cutting room floor. They are thought to be of secondary or tertiary importance for understanding the world. But occasionally (25% in my story) one of those factors matters a lot, and when that happens, the theory cannot explain the case.

---


Q) I am familiar with the multitude of realist sub-theories (Offensive, Defensive, Structural, etc..) Do you feel that since there can be no real explanation without a sound theory that realist IR scholars should focus first on trying to resolve differences within the realist realm or that there is a benefit to allowing the many sub-theories to compete with the sub-theories of other large theoretical traditions (liberalism, constructivism, institutionalism, etc..)

A) I think the differences you mention are not resolvable at a purely theoretical level. The key at that level is to make sure that the realist theories are specified as clearly and comprehensively as possible so that they can be tested against each other to see which theory has the most explanatory power. What happens in the real world ultimately determines which realist theory is the best, but that is not the same as resolving differences.

---


**Nuclear proliferation**


---

Q) Do you believe there is high likelihood of non-state actors obtaining offensive nuclear capability in our lifetime?

A) I think it is extremely unlikely that a non-state actor will acquire nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. Virtually every state in the international system has a deep-seated interest in making sure that does not happen.

---

**Donald Trump**

---

Q) Is Donald Trump a realist?

A) I think Trump is a loose cannon who knows remarkably little about international politics.

---

**North Korea/China/USA conflict**


---

Q) From your perspective, what lessons can we take from the U.S. experience in Iraq when applied to dealing with North Korea?

A) The one clear lesson we can take from Iraq is: don't invade NK for the purpose of doing regime change. But that is highly unlikely anyway, because NK has nuclear weapons. If Iraq had nuclear weapons in 2003, Saddam would almost certainly still be in power!

---

Q: It would seem to me that any agreement that could be achieved between the US and North Korea that would be predicated on a reduced US military presence in the region would be a significant gain Beijing and Moscow.


A) The US simply cannot reduce its presence in Northeast Asia, because they are needed there to contain China [...] But let's assume I am wrong and that the US is willing to pull most of its forces out of South Korea and the surrounding area. Would that work to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons? I think the answer is no, because NK's greatest fear is regime change, which the US is addicted to, and the US can always strike NK from afar (and maybe in conjunction with SK's formidable conventional forces) after NK has abandoned its nuclear weapons. As long as NK has nuclear weapons the US will not attack it for purposes of regime change. So, why would they give those weapons up? It would be a remarkably foolish move on their part. They know what happened to Gaddafi after he gave up his WMD programs on the promise the US and its allies would not threaten his survival. He's now six feet under the ground!

---


Q) In a recent PBS News Hour interview, you argued that China has ""remarkably little leverage"" over North Korea. Could you elaborate a bit further on this, given that China essentially controls 90% of North Korea's economy?


A) China cannot afford to let NK collapse, because it is a strategically important buffer between SK, where there are substantial American military forces, and China. If NK were to collapse, there is the grave danger (from China's perspective) that Korea would be unified by SK, which would bring the Americans right up to China's border. That outcome is simply unacceptable to Beijing. Again, China needs an independent NK. China, for example, cannot go along with tough UN sanctions aimed at bringing NK to its knees, as the US would like. NK leaders know that, which allows them to thumb their noses at China

---

Q) You've stated in earlier interviews that most strategies to contain North Korea would fail and that it is virtually impossible to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. What do you think the United States should do concerning North Korea?

A) I don't believe I have said that most strategies to contain NK are likely to fail. I have argued that the various strategies designed to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons are almost certain to fail, as NK has powerful incentives to keep those weapons. Nevertheless, I think it is feasible to contain NK, mainly because there is no plausible way it can employ its nuclear weapons for advantage. And if it were to use them, it would probably be turned into a smoking, radiating ruin.

---

Q) Was NK's nuclear program was a waste of their time and resources. Who wins with a nuclear NK?

A) On the contrary; NK was smart to build a nuclear arsenal, as nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent. You do not see the United States moving to get rid of its nuclear weapons, despite the fact it has the most powerful conventional forces in the world, weak neighbors to the north and south, and two giant moats to its east and west. Why? Because American policymakers want nuclear weapons for deterrent purposes just in case they run into serious trouble down the road. Given how weak NK is relative to its neighbors, it has even greater incentives to possess nuclear weapons. Of course, it is not in America's interest for NK to have a nuclear deterrent, but that is a different matter.

---


Q) In case of the fall of the North Korean regime and unification of the peninsula, would US military presence be removed from the region or they'll be kept in the new country as a counterbalance to China? Wouldn't that upset China because they are encircled by the US?

A) I do not think there will be reunification of the two Koreas, because it would almost certainly be done under the auspices of SK, which is joined at the hip with the US. That would mean the American military would be able to move up to the Yalu River. That possibility is what brought China into the Korean War in the fall of 1950. Beijing had no intention of letting MacArthur's forces reach the Yalu River. Nothing is changed in that regard. Thus for Korean unification to happen, the US would have to completely sever its military alliance with SK and allow the newly unified Korea to be either neutral or pro-Chinese. SK would also have to be willing to go down that road. I do not see either SK or the US agreeing to that outcome.

---

Q) What do you think of the potential nuclearization of both the Republic of Korea and the State of Japan in the aftermath of this crisis if it does not escalate? What consequences might such a thing have? Furthermore, where you sitting in the Oval Office how would you handle the crisis in the context of the increasingly coercive regime in Beijing?

A) The US will go to great lengths to prevent Japan and SK from acquiring nuclear weapons. The main reason is that the US does not want a close ally having its finger on a nuclear trigger in a crisis. The great fear is that the ally in question might use its nuclear weapons if it feels its survival is at risk, which would almost certainly drag the United States into a nuclear war. The ideal situation for the United States is to control all the nuclear weapons within its alliance structure, so as to minimize the chances of unwanted nuclear escalation. Japan and SK, however, have to be thinking about getting their own nuclear weapons these days for three good reasons: 1) they are surrounded by threatening states that have their own nuclear weapons (China and NK); 2) the US might not use its nuclear weapons to defend Japan or SK if their survival is threatened, because of fear that the United States would get hit with nuclear weapons by the adversary; 3) the Trump administration looks unreliable, as it does not seem deeply committed to protecting its allies and even hints about sending the troops home. It is hard to say for sure how this is going to play out over time, but there is likely to be at least much more talk in Japan and SK about acquiring their own nuclear deterrent.

---


Q) Is NK a rational power and acquiring nuclear weapons for deterrence, or do you believe that the Kim Regime is irrational and must be stopped?

A) I think the Kim regime is rational, which is why I think a nuclear NK can be deterred. To the extent I worry about any country behaving irrationally over the NK situation, it is the US. I believe that view is widely shared in East Asia and even here in the United States.

---


Q) Do you think any method of politics or negotiation can denuclearize North Korea? Also, do you think South Korea would ever use it's ""Decapitation Squad"", on the Kim regime?

A) I don't think it is possible at this juncture to get NK to give up its nuclear weapons. SK's decision to set up a ""Decapitation Squad"" makes it even more likely that NK will never give up its nuclear weapons. The basic principle one should keep in mind here is that the more you threaten NK, the greater its incentives to hang on to its nuclear weapons.

---

**China/US conflict**

---

Q) I know you have said that China cannot rise peacefully, but how do you think US-China economic interdependence factors into the likelihood of conflict between them?

A) Many people I engage with over the question of whether China can rise peacefully believe that economic interdependence between China and the US, as well as China and its neighbors, is the key to China's peaceful rise. I do not think economic interdependence is a sound basis for peace. Remember that China has made it clear that it would go to war if Taiwan declared its independence, knowing full well that it would pay a stiff economic price. This case and many others tell me that when push comes to shove, politics trumps economics, especially when security matters are on the table.


---

**Central Asian region/Russia/Ukraine**

---

Q) How important do you think the Central Asian region is going to be in terms of overall Asian politics and the tug of war between regional powers like China, India, Russia, etc? And how do you see relations between Russia and China develop in near future as they're both competing for the favor of many of the countries in that region?

A) I think that Sino-Russian relations are good today, mainly because the US and its West European allies drove Russia into the arms of China in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. China and Russia are not natural allies, and Central Asia is a region where there is potential for conflict between Beijing and Moscow. The Russians are very worried about China's ""one belt, one road"" initiative, in part because it calls for projecting Chinese power into Central Asia, which is a strategically important region to Moscow. There is little doubt that China and India are likely to be adversaries in the future, as the recent territorial dispute between them in the area near Bhutan makes clear.

---

Q) What West European allies could have done differently in Ukraine crisis?

A) Not tried to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border. Specifically, the West should have refrained from trying to integrate Ukraine into the EU, and especially into NATO. The West, and especially the United States, failed to realize that Ukraine is of vital strategic importance to Russia, and that there is no way it would allow Ukraine to become a member of a hostile military alliance.

---


Q) Hello, thanks for taking your time to be here. I was wondering your take on Russian arctic expansion, and whether or not you think it will have an important role in the geo-politics of this century.


A) Russia is already a powerful presence in the Arctic, but so far there has been little competition and much cooperation between Russia and the other countries that are important players in that region. The US has been busy elsewhere so it has not been deeply involved in the Arctic. That situation could change, in which case competition between Moscow and Washington in the Arctic would start up. I might also say that I find it hard to see what salient issue the countries engaged in the region might fight over. All of this is to say that my sense is that there is not likely to be big trouble in the Arctic anytime soon.

---

**Israel-Palestine conflict**

---

Q) What is your view on how the influence of the Israel lobby on US foreign policy has changed under the Obama and Trump administrations and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general?

A) I think that the influence of the lobby has hardly changed since Obama first took office. It remains a remarkably powerful interest group. What has changed is that now lots of people understand that there is an Israel lobby and that it wields great influence on US foreign policy. Regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, it seems clear to me that the two-state solution is dead and that there is going to be a Greater Israel for the foreseeable future. I agree with former Israeli prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, who have said that in the absence of a two-state solution, Greater Israel would be an apartheid state.


---

**Saudi-Iran-Qatari conflict**

---

Q) The recent blockade of most of the GCC states on Qatar has left the tiny state cornered from its traditional allies (and cousins). How do Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, etc. benefit from the continued alienation of one of their richer neighbors, especially considering that Qatar has not folded to their demands, and seem unlikely to in the near future?

A)  I do not know how Saudi Arabia and its allies benefit from picking a major-league fight with Qatar, a move that drives Qatar toward closer relations with Iran. It seems like a strategically foolish move, as does Riyadh's decision to go to war in Yemen, which has turned into a giant mess for the Saudis. And, of course, Saudi Arabia is on the losing end in Syria. All of this tells you that there is something deeply wrong with Saudi foreign policy.

---

Q) Would you say that you see Saudi Arabia remaining a regional power in the next 60 years?

A) It's impossible to say what the future holds for SA. It does look like the foundations of that society are beginning to form cracks, but I am not sure where it all leads. I might also note that SA is not an especially powerful regional actor from a military point of view. Iran, Israel and Turkey are both much more powerful militarily.

---

Q) Is Saudi Arabia facing Shia/Iranian encirclement or establishing a Shia crescent that presents a threat to the Gulf Monarchies, the wider Sunni world, Israel, the US, etc?

A) Iran is not a threat to the Gulf monarchies, contrary to what most people in those countries think. First, Iran, which has never invaded a country in its history, shows no inclination to want to invade Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies. Second, and more importantly, the United States would intervene immediately if Iran invaded one of the Gulf monarchies and the Iranians know that. American leaders have made it manifestly clear that they will not tolerate Iran becoming a regional hegemony in the Persian Gulf.

Q) What's the best way forward with regards to Afghanistan?

A) The best strategy is to leave and let those stakeholders you mention deal with Afghanistan. There is nothing the US can do to fix the problem. This is simply the least bad strategy. Obama did not pull all of the US forces out of Afghanistan by January 2009 and Trump recently decided to hang on in Afghanistan, because neither one of them wants to be accused of ""losing"" Afghanistan. Both surely recognize that there is no clever strategy for rescuing the situation in Afghanistan.

192,When Should States be able to Declare Independence? When Should they be able to be Recognised?,101.0,szofnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/szofnz/when_should_states_be_able_to_declare/,48.0,1645641305.0,"**Contradictions in Statecraft**

On the 7th and 27th of April 2014 respectively, the Donestk and Luhansk People's Republics declared independence from Ukraine following a contested referendum after the Maidan movement in which 89% of voters allegedly chose independence. Nobody recognised the breakaway states at the time, though Russia engaged in de facto relations with them.

On February 21st, 2022, Russian President Putin announced its recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. It then signed treaties of friendship with them and, on their invitation, moved troops into what is considered internationally to be part of Eastern Ukraine. This was widely condemned in the west as a breach of international law and an invasion of Ukrainian territory-obviously, they did not recognise the independence of the L/DPR, who had declared independence unilaterally from Ukraine. No states other than Russia and no international organisations recognise their independence.

However, the politics of *how* a state is allowed to gain independence is unclear and contested in international politics. Thus, so is the politics of *when* a state can be recognised. Let's look to another example: Kosovo. In 2008, the Kosovan Assembly proclaimed independence unilaterally from and against the will of Serbia. This time, it was much of the west who recognised Kosovan independence, with Serbia and Russia declaring it illegal. Kosovo is not recognised by the UN, but enjoys recognition by some international organisations and is recognised by just over 50% of UN member states.

Clearly, there is some contradiction in the policy of states as to *when* one can unilaterally declare independence. Those who oppose each of these declarations claimed it was illegal, whereas those who supported it claimed it was legal under some framework or another. What does international law say on this matter?

**The Law?**

When Serbia referred the case of Kosovo to the ICJ, the ICJ ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence *[was not](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/141/141-20100722-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf)* in violation of international law. It decided this, to oversimplify, because international law *does not* prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, because the Kosovan Assembly was deemed a legitimate representative of the people of Kosovo, and because the territorial integrity of states only applies *between* states. Some judges also argued that the failure of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina as well as the abuses Kosovo had faced under Serbian rule made it legal, but that is not the consensus of the 10 ICJ judges who voted in favour of its legality. The question of whether this sets a precedent for international law *as a whole* is hotly debated among international legal experts and not something I intend to settle here. nonetheless, it is clear that the legal framework through which the ICJ accepted Kosovo's declaration as valid *can* be transposed, at least in part, onto other situations, even if it cannot in full (as the US argues).

So, how does this translate to the D/LPRs? I will not give an opinion in the OP, but the question surely is whether:

-The D/LPRs are representative of the people they claim to govern over.

-Whether the D/LPRs are independent, internal actors in Ukraine (rather than it being a state-state violation of sovereignty).

The fact it was unilateral, according to the ICJ, is not a point against its legitimacy.

**The Limits of the Law**

Of course, international law is not the most important thing in determining state behaviour. This ruling, whether or not it gives precedent, has not been consistently upheld by the international community, meaning it is not the basis of whether a group *can* declare independence.

I will give two examples: Catalonia, and Iraqi Kurdistan.

Both held referendums in 2017, legitimised by the Catalan and KRG parliaments (but not approved by the parent state), as to whether to go independent. In Catalonia, the ""no"" side boycotted the vote, and so the result-which was 92% in favour-only had a 43% turnout. The KRG referendum, by contrast, had a much higher turnout at 72%. 93% voted for independence.

The Catalan parliament was freely and fairly elected and, although the KRG parliament is only semi-democratic, the referendum showed a move to independence is still representative of popular opinion. Even though the Catalan referendum had below 50% turnout, as the Kosovo case shows, you don't need a referendum for a representative parliament to be legally allowed to declare independence.

Despite this, both were shut down by force and received no international recognition. So, when can states declare independence? Is there any coherent logic beyond geopolitical interests?

**Ethics/Morality of Declaring Independence**

The final part is what you think we, as individuals, should think. When do you think it's ok to declare independence? When do you think it's ok for states to recognise a polity that has declared independence? This is a question beyond pure academic interest, considering public opinion influences state behaviour (unless you're a neorealist) in what Putnam describes as a ""[two-level game](http://www.guillaumenicaise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Putnam-The-Logic-of-Two-Level-Games.pdf)"".

Does it have to be in agreement with the parent state to be legitimate (as Serbia, Ukraine, Spain, and Iraq argued in our case studies)?

Does the body declaring it have to either have support through a free + fair referendum or be democratically elected?

Does it have to have the support of the international community?

Do negotiations have to have failed?

Does there have to be human rights abuses beforehand?",geopolitics,Ukraine

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Source: [Threat Group-4127 Targets Google Accounts](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-google-accounts)

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich.

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis?

Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections?

***How Ukraine is finally moving forward, although in to slow speed***

A couple of days ago, something strange happened in the rich suburbs of Kyiv. The newly formed anti-corruption unit went to a Ukrainian judge to arrest him for corruption, just to be met with gunfire from the judge. In any other countries, the judge would be arrested at the spot, but in Ukraine, he is now forced to home arrest with an ankle monitor while the case is waiting to be brought up by to the court. Which might never happen.

Ukraine is still working on establishing a High Anti-corruption court, that is set to be established in March^(1), but the process goes slowly as almost all aspect of Ukrainian top players is trying to sabotage it. In Kyiv, the around 700 people working in National Anti-Corruption Bureau is facing an uphill battle. However, the positive in this that there now is a battle and the ANC has a powerful ally, the European Union.

To say it a little bit pessimistic, Petro Poroshenko is the best President Ukraine have had so far, but the bar was extremely low and he is not raising it considerably higher. The establishment of the Anti-corruption court comes after huge pressure from the EU, and already before the start, there is skepticism of the judges appointed to the court with several of them vetoed by international experts.^(2)

Poroshenko is taken small steps, and only being pushed by EU as a guarantee for more money. On every step of the way, he meets a conflict of interest, both with the powerful oligarchs and own personal interest as one of the richest men in the country.

***Small steps...***

However, it is to be said in all fairness, that there have been some successful reforms in the country. The capital police force has taken the ""Georgian way""^(3) of reforming the police, has met some success (although not in the same degree as in Georgia). More crime is reported, a large amount of the pre-Soviet breakup is removed and replaced with a new generation that is less prone to small bribe corruption, who also have access to more modern training and equipment. The small bribes as a shakedown of tourists, cars etc have largely disappeared from the public view in the capital.

The government has reformed its tax and pension systems, created an online public system for procurement contracts, making it more difficult to make payments under the table or take money of public bids and overhauled the tax code making more people pay them as the work and risk of not paying it not being worth it.

The payroll tax has been halved, which has reduced the shadow economy. The ProZorro electronic procurement system has cleaned up much of the small time corruption (f.ex order 600 uniforms instead of the needed 500, and then sell the last 100 yourself. Corporate governance has improved in several big state companies and decentralization reform has endowed municipalities with the new initiative.

**The first success, Naftogaz**

Before 2015, the state-owned gas and oil company Naftogaz was the milk cow of Ukraine oligarchs, draining the state budget for millions. After the maidan, the rules were changed. The old guard was dismissed and the new ones started with implementing transparency in all sector of the company. It was reorganized into a more efficient structure, and integrated into the EU gas structure. Every procurement and every gas transfer become public online, and it followed the market trends.  As a result, it delivered a 34 bln Hryvnia surplus in 2017 (1.3 bln dollar) and contributing about USD 3.9 bln to the national budget.

Furthermore, after years of fighting the oligarch owners of Ukrainian Air, the government streamlined the entry of low carrier airlines to Ukraine. In two years the prices from Europe to Ukraine has fallen 3x with investment being made into not only capital but also regional airports. The largest ones have doubled their passenger traffic since 2016. A new train from Kyiv to Boryspol has also been built. The visa-free agreement in 2017 has created a traffic boom in Ukraine, creating workplaces, revenue and a larger tourism segment of the country.^(6)

**Not better for the ordinary citizen**

It can be argued that Ukraine is going through a mild version of the crazy 90s that Russia experienced. Although the slow reforms are giving Ukraine a leg to stand on economically, it is not getting better for the average citizen. The success of Naftogaz has made the gas less subsidized and therefore more expensive for the ordinary Ukrainian. The potholes in the roads outside of Kyiv is still there and the facade on the local hospital is not painted over. The increased minimum salary has created more unemployed persons on the streets

Outside Kyiv, there are still large amounts of Soviet-era infrastructure that keeps the country up.

**The Russian problem**

In the east, large amounts of north and South, Ukraine neighbors Russia, and is in a frozen conflict since 2014. As a result, the state budget has given priority to its armed forces. There is no time after the independence the Ukrainian armed forces are better positioned for war then they are now. They train better, they have better equipment and they have 4 years of experience in battle.

Although a full-scale armed conflict with Russia is almost guaranteed a Russian victory, the cost will be much higher than only 4 years ago.

From being a military that could support around 7-10k in early 2014, it now employs and supports an army of 250k soldiers. However, like in Ukrainian society in general, corruption still remains the biggest enemy. The national defense provider enterprise *Ukroboronprom,* still has the same structure as the Soviet days and a major source of corruption.^(7) It can be argued that the corruption in the enterprise is a direct threat to the Ukrainian independence. Although it is to be said that the enterprise is profitable for the Ukrainian state as a whole. Its just the potential is wasted.

**Waiting for an election**

In an interview with the Guardian, Kurt Volker said there was still a substantial gap between the US and Russia over how a United Nations peacekeeping force could be deployed to end the four-year war, and predicted that Vladimir Putin would wait for presidential and parliamentary elections in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine) next year before reconsidering his negotiating position and further actions.

&#x200B;

**The two problems**

So there are two problems that Ukraine is facing. One is the constant Russian treat hanging over them and the second one is the desperate need for modernization, that for every hour hemorrhage money from the country. The first one is difficult to handle, but the second one is in Ukraines own hands.

There aren’t many examples in the post-WW2 era where one state lost a war but continued in power, having signed a peace treaty where it ceded land to another. 

There are a few grey areas though, for example the most recent war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, however Armenia wasn’t ceding its own territory. Iraq annexed Kuwait in its entirety having deposed the government in 1990, so that’s not the same as what I’m asking either. Collapsing states like Yugoslavia in the 90s isn’t quite the same dynamic either. 

So, as a thought experiment, let’s imagine Russia invades Ukraine and scores a quick victory, capturing Kiev in a month. The Ukrainian government flees to Lviv, but soon signs a peace treaty ceding lands in southern and eastern Ukraine to Russia (this is only an example, the plausibility of this specific situation isn’t important to the broader question). The treaty is ratified by the Rada and the Duma.

**Kaplan on NATO**

> The first thing to understand is that the alliance system of the latter half of the twentieth century is dead. Warfare by committee, as practiced by NATO, has simply become too cumbersome in an age that requires light and lethal strikes... The organization's end effectively came with the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, in the aftermath of which, despite talk of a broad-based coalition, European militaries have usually done little more than patrol and move into areas already pacified by U.S. soldiers and Marines—a job more suggestive of the United Nations. NATO today is a medium for the expansion of bilateral training missions between the United States and formerly communist countries and republics.. 

> …the alliance is literally and symbolically weak. For it to regain its political significance, NATO must become a military alliance that no one doubts is willing to fight and kill at a moment's notice… The more NATO expands eastward, the more superficial and unwieldy it becomes as a fighting force, and the more questionable becomes its claim that it will fight in defense of any member state. Taking in yet more substandard militaries like Ukraine's and Georgia's too soon is simply not in NATO's interest. We can't just declare an expansion of a defense alliance because of demonstrations somewhere in support of democracy… Only by making it an agile force that is ready to land on, say, West African beaches at a few days' or hours' notice can we save NATO.

>And we need to save it. NATO is ours to lead—unlike the increasingly powerful European Union, whose own defense force, should it become a reality, would inevitably emerge as a competing regional power, one that might align itself with China in order to balance against us. Let me be even clearer about something that policymakers and experts often don't want to be clear about. NATO and an autonomous European defense force cannot both prosper. Only one can—and we should want it to be the former, so that Europe is a military asset for us, not a liability, as we confront China.

Obviously rumors of NATO’s demise were premature—the Libya intervention proved the alliance wasn’t entirely defunct— but otherwise Kaplan proves remarkably prescient. The last paragraph, in particular, is particularly impactful considering Trump’s Eurotrip fall-out.

**Kaplan on anti-China coalition**

> In the Pacific, however, a Bismarckian arrangement still prospers, helped along by the pragmatism of our Hawaii-based military officers, five time zones removed from the ideological hothouse of Washington, D.C. In fact, PACOM represents a much purer version of Bismarck's imperial superstructure than anything the Bush administration created prior to invading Iraq. As Henry Kissinger writes in Diplomacy (1994), Bismarck forged alliances in all directions from a point of seeming isolation, without the constraints of ideology. He brought peace and prosperity to Central Europe by recognizing that when power relationships are correctly calibrated, wars tend to be avoided. Only a similarly pragmatic approach will allow us to accommodate China's inevitable re-emergence as a great power. 

> The better road is for PACOM to deter China in Bismarckian fashion, from a geographic hub of comparative isolation—the Hawaiian Islands—with spokes reaching out to major allies such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and India. These countries, in turn, would form secondary hubs to help us manage the Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian archipelagoes, among other places, and also the Indian Ocean. The point of this arrangement would be to dissuade China so subtly that over time the rising behemoth would be drawn into the PACOM alliance system without any large-scale conflagration—the way NATO was ultimately able to neutralize the Soviet Union.

>PACOM's immersion in Asian power dynamics gives it unusual diplomatic weight, and consequently more leverage in Washington. And PACOM will not be nearly as constrained as CENTCOM by Washington-based domestic politics. Our actions in the Pacific will not be swayed by the equivalent of the Israel lobby; Protestant evangelicals will care less about the Pacific Rim than about the fate of the Holy Land. And because of the vast economic consequences of misjudging the power balance in East Asia, American business and military interests are likely to run in tandem toward a classically conservative policy of deterring China without needlessly provoking it, thereby amplifying PACOM's authority. Our stance toward China and the Pacific, in other words, comes with a built-in stability—and this, in turn, underscores the notion of a new Cold War that is sustainable over the very long haul. Moreover, the complexity of the many political and military relationships managed by PACOM will give the command considerably greater influence than that currently exercised by CENTCOM—which, as a few military experts have disparagingly put it to me, deals only with a bunch of ""third-rate Middle Eastern armies.""

>PACOM's objective, in the words of a Pacific-based Marine general, must be ""military multilateralism on steroids."" This is not just a question of our future training with the [Singaporeans] in Brunei, of flying test sorties with the Indian air force, of conducting major annual exercises in Thailand, or of utilizing a soon-to-open training facility in northern Australia with the approval of our alliance partners. It's also a matter of forging interoperability with friendly Asian militaries at the platoon level, by constantly moving U.S. troops from one training deployment to another.

>This would be an improvement over NATO, whose fighting fitness has been hampered by the addition of substandard former-Eastern-bloc militaries. Politics, too, favors a tilt toward the Pacific: tensions between the United States and Europe currently impede military integration, whereas our Pacific allies, notably Japan and Australia, want more military engagement with the United States, to counter the rise of the Chinese navy. This would work to our benefit. The Japanese military, although small, possesses elite niche capabilities, in special-forces and diesel-submarine warfare. And the aggressive frontier style of the Australians makes them cognitively closer to Americans than even the British.

The main takeaway is this: China will fight the US asymmetrically, and rigid, heavily-centralized structures are especially vulnerable. The US must therefore oppose China through loose, decentralized networks: a political network between allied Asian partners, and a geographic network spread across small, semi-formal military outposts. The advantage of networks is their fault tolerance. An informal alliance can lose a node to Chinese renminbi diplomacy (like say, the Philippines or Cambodia) but still function in a way a centralized, consensus-driven organization like ASEAN or NATO cannot. A geographic network can lose a runway to the PLA Rocket Force and simply redirect forces to the nearest friendly alternative. 

This informal coalition is exactly what we’ve seen the US develop over the past decade, aided by regional fears over China’s growing military might and territorial ambitions. However, this approach is weakened by Asian nation’s reluctance to jeopardize relations with Beijing. Vietnam is a great example: they can’t risk formally allying themselves with the US, but are happy to play the two powers against each other. In October 16, the US made a [symbolic port call](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-vietnam-navy-idUSKCN1241D3) to Vietnam; two weeks later, the PLAN arrived [at the exact same port](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2038971/chinese-navy-ships-make-first-port-call-vietnams-cam). Duterte’s China pivot is another example. Both the Philippines and Vietnam are happy to purchase US weapons, but neither wants to ally itself too closely a superpower that could theoretically withdraw its entire regional presence on a whim. China, after all, isn't going anywhere. Overall, I think Kaplan accurately predicted the US approach, but underestimated the degree to which China’s economic influence and soft power could preempt it. Looking specifically at the South China Sea, it seems this ‘Bismarkian alliance’ approach has been ineffectual in deterring Chinese maritime ambitions.

**Kaplan on US basing network**

> Andersen Air Force Base, on Guam's northern tip, represents the future of U.S. strategy in the Pacific. It is the most potent platform anywhere in the world for the projection of American military power… Guam, which is also home to a submarine squadron and an expanding naval base, is significant because of its location... Flying to North Korea from the West Coast of the United States takes thirteen hours; from Guam it takes four… This little island, close to China, has the potential to become the hub in the wheel of a new, worldwide constellation of bases that will move the locus of U.S. power from Europe to Asia. In the event of a conflict with Taiwan, if we had a carrier battle group at Guam we would force the Chinese either to attack it in port—thereby launching an assault on sovereign U.S. territory, and instantly becoming the aggressor in the eyes of the world—or to let it sail, in which case the carrier group could arrive off the coast of Taiwan only two days later.

> There could be a problem with all of this. By making Guam a Hawaii of the western Pacific, we make life simple for the Chinese, because we give them just one problem to solve: how to threaten or intimidate Guam. The way to counter them will be not by concentration but by dispersion. So how will we prevent Guam from becoming too big?

> In a number of ways. We may build up Palau, an archipelago of 20,000 inhabitants between Mindanao, in the Philippines, and the Federated States of Micronesia, whose financial aid is contingent on a defense agreement with us. We will keep up our bases in Central Asia, close to western China—among them Karshi-Khanabad, in Uzbekistan, and Manas, in Kyrgyzstan, which were developed and expanded for the invasion of Afghanistan. And we will establish what are known as cooperative security locations [OP note: small, unofficial *ad hoc* military outposts].

While we can assess PACOM’s alliance-building success through media reports, FMS and exercises, the physical implementation of Kaplan’s proposed network-building is more difficult to gauge: CSLs are by nature unobtrusive and publicity averse, and some may not even formally exist until the need arises. Certainly some specific predictions have been disproven—the US lost both Manas and K2, and Guam continues to grow (despite the lagging USMC relocation). Andersen AFB, for example, now hosts PACOM’s Continuous Bomber Presence, with B-52s, B-1s and B-2 bombers on a single runway. However, there are signs that the DOD recognizes the dangers of centralization and is embracing the idea of nimble, dynamic and diffused bases. 

In Japan, F35Bs were permanently assigned to MCAS Iwakuni, and there are plans to move V-22 Ospreys to Yokota AB; by making VTOL aircraft the [cornerstone of Pacific defense](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/politics/marines-f-35-stealth-jets-deploy-to-japan/), the US reduces its reliance on large runways like on Yokota, Kadena and Andersen. There has also been greater focus on interoperability between USFJ/USFK/PACOM/MDA and regional militaries. Quite difficult to ascertain how successful the US has been in negotiating emergency basing rights and runway acccess, but certainly US base vulnerability to China's ballistic missiles is no secret. One would imagine PACOM warplans are developed with that vulnerability in mind. 

> What we can probably expect from China in the near future is specific demonstrations of strength—like its successful forcing down of a U.S. Navy EP-3E surveillance plane in the spring of 2001. 

As near as I can tell, this was flat-out wrong. China did make a more assertive turn around 2008 (three years after this article was published), but I don't recall anything so ham-fisted as what Kaplan describes here.

The objectives to force Russia to change its behaviour by isolating it diplomatically and economically has failed. In the years since not only has Russia manage to defy  expectations about its economy but its ability to project power and influence around the world in various ways, including the US. At the same time Russia has a permanent need for foreign capital and technology, and the sanctions hamper that.

We are now in new phase I will term ""Diplomatic Bargaining"", in which both sides try to convince the other to accept all their conditions which will be very good for them but if they dont accept it will be fine for themselves and very bad for the other.

The interests of both countries is simple; Russia wants control and influence in Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine, and sees it as existential, while the US wants to prevent a hegemon in Eastern Europe, or just Europe in general. These are competitive interests, and will likely never be reconciled.

The world order seems to be shifting closer to that of a multipolar world, with the US having the ability to project power onto every part of the globe but at the same time having limits on that power. Other major powers around the world are finding it to be in their interest to expand their contacts and hedge bets. It is very likely that the US will continue upsetting the global trade order it set up to subsidise its allies during the Cold War. In this context the US and Russia will no longer have an exclusive relationship like in the Cold War, but have to seriously take into account other players as they seek to maximise their national interests.

Some questions to consider in this thread

1. Will the US and Russia compromise and agree on a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe?
2. How will each countries' domestic audience hamper their diplomats' ability to make agreements?
3. What other countries matter in the US-Russia relations and what are their interests?",geopolitics,Ukraine

*Disclaimer2: English isn't my primary language and this my first post so I hope I'm doing it right*

# Background

Since the 2011 revolution and the NATO operation who killed Muammar Gaddafi, there is a power vacuum in Libya and several parties are trying to fill it. Even if today there are only 2 main belligerents, there have been up to 6 in the beginning, including ISIS, Al-Qaeda, tribes of the South and the National Salvation Government, all inactive today.

# The situation today

The 2 remaining power in the country are:

* The **Government of National Accord (GNA)**, endorsed by the UN as the sole legitimate executive in Libya. They control the capital, Tripoli, and the north-west of the country, including 6 of the 10 biggest cities of Lybia in term of population.
* The House of Representatives, better known for its armed branch the **Libyan National Army (LNA)** led by **Khalifa Haftar**, based in Tobruk (#12 cities in pop), control the east part of the country and the south (which is mainly desert, and oil fields).

There are also tribes in the far-South but without any major city or resources, they do not take part in the conflict nowadays, although they did take control of El-Sharara oil field in 2014.

I found the map below [here](https://mondediplo.com/maps/libya-divided) *(but unfortunately I have only the French paper version so I scanned and ""translated"" it as best as I could).*

# Support

* GNA is **recognized by the UN** and mainly supported by **Turkey** (money, men (mainly jihadists), anti aerial equipment, drones, tanks) and **Qatar**. Germany and Ukraine are also helping them, more discreetly.
* LNA is **supported** by **2 permanent members of the UN Security Council**: **Russia** and **France**, both providing equipment (missiles? and help with fighters from France, all kind of equipment and mercenaries from Russia). Their allies also take in Egypt, United Arab Emirates (**UAE**, who delivered drones and transformed agricultural planes in 2014), Saudi Arabia, Syria, Greece, Israel and Bielorussia. Mercenaries coming from Chad and Sudan are also fighting for Haftar.

Italy is playing both sides to prevent new migrant crisis from Libya to Sicily.

These ""allies"" are in reality the true masters of the country: at the Berlin summit in January 2020, neither the GNA nor the LNA were present, but they both agreed to a ceasefire when their allies called for it.

Foreign countries massively use mercenaries or private security companies (Reflex Response, Russkie System Bezopasnosti, SADAT Defense Consultancy...) in order not to involve their own military.

# Motivations

Obviously, the fact that **Libyan oil reserves are the biggest in Africa** is a strong motivation for all player involved, especially those their economy rely deeply on natural resources (Russia for exportation, Turkey and France for importation).

Another motivation for Turkey and Russia is to grow their influence in Africa, which both lack (compared to France or UK). Obtaining military base on foreign soil is a strategic advantage for the future.

Erdogan is also proud of his international policy and use it to inspire the greatness of Ottoman empire in the mind of its domestic supporters.

# Turkey vs Russia

Even if they fight opposite side, Turkey and Russia are great economic partner and both have common geopolitical opponents, like EU. They seem to know each other and not to push too hard to keep good relationship between them; it is what is happening in Syria and they both accommodate it.

# EU vs Turkey

France and Turkey are fighting in different sides in 2 conflicts in the Mediterranean Sea: Libya, and most recently, Cyprus and Greece. Every time oil is the center of the conflict. It seems that Turkey has given up joining the EU and thus violated Greece and Cyprus waters. But they have the control over millions of migrants who could enter Europe, and therefore Germany and Italy are sided with Turkey on the Libyan conflict.

# What next?

The first challenge of the conflict was to get rid of Islamists and jihadists with help of the coalition but now imported mercenaries from Syria are jihadists. We should hope it would not cause new terrorist groups taking part in the conflict.

It seems that keeping an unstable and split Libya is a cheap and easy way for all players, except Libya itself, to exploit natural resources of the country.

It is however not sustainable, either from a point of view of domestic policy or international policy regarding to the UN or for Libya. Exploiting all its oil reserves would take years - or decade - and when the ceasefire is broken it will be a long and expensive war.

Turkey and Russia economy aren't prepared to maintain a long war.

European population (France, Germany) might not like the idea of their country invading another, leading to neocolonialism critics.

Libyan people don't want several years of civil war and 2 governments for 1 country like it has happened in Syria.

2021 is bringing new hopes and new conflicts.  People forget the Black Sea area, where several battles and two rival powers emerging, comes closer to clash. Where will the next hotspot be? This article goes through some point of the relationship between the three main actors, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia. It goes into some of the conflicts to try to explain and give an overview of why this region might be the hotspot of 2021.

**Ukraine**

After Zelensky took over the power in Kyiv, there has been some de-escalation in the regional conflict with Russia. Prisoner swaps and some milder tone in the negation around the Minsk agreement. However, as 2020 changed the world, it also changes the priorities for 2021.

Contradiction to popular belief, Trump did reinforce the Ukrainian military, f.ex, allowing Javelin missiles to the front line if needed. The aid was lenient and open. The problem is with the Zelensky government. The former comedian built his campaign with promising to clean up the domestic issues that hunted the country. The administration did not prioritize the conflict, hoping that a better relationship with Russia would free up resources at home. However, the Zelensky honeymoon is by all means over. The street's situation is that the President is not capable or willing to go head to head with the almighty oligarchy that runs the economy. The positive economic trend that started to show in 2019 is gone in the aftermath of the COVID crisis.

The President is now in a bad situation. The local mayor election was a considerable disappointment for Zelensky. His political party **Servant of the People** (named after the sitcom that launched him as a household name) did not get one mayor in any of the country's most important cities—almost all of the old guard managed to be voted back into the office.

His rival and former Petro Poroshenko also failed to relaunch into the political scene. His candidate did not manage to win the election as mayor in the western city of Lviv.  The city is seen by many as the most pro-western and anti-Zelensky region of Ukraine.

With a new President in Washington Zelensky might go down the same route as Poroshenko and start divesting more resources into the Ukrainian military.

No matter the view Poroshenko, this has been his major success as President. From the ragtag army in the aftermath of the Crimea-crisis, they are now a fighting force that has made Russia put more military on the border to keep up. Now Zelensky might do the same. The focus back on the military is an action that can force Russia into a more active role in the frozen conflict.

**The Ankara connection**

The relationship between Turkey and Ukraine have been more cordial and warm after the events of 2014. In  February, the Turkish President Recep  Erdoğan visited Ukraine and met with President Zelensky. There the two Presidents signed an agreement on military-financial cooperation. It provided the Turkish side to give about $ 36 mln for  Ukraine's purchase of Turkish military and dual-use goods. This deal worries Kremlin, especially after the recent conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Armenia that was supplied and secured by Russia, nearly lost the conflict against Turkey supported Azerbaijan. The country that equipt itself with Russian gear lost against the military that got its weapons from Turkey.

The geopolitics issues in the Caucasus aside, this is a considerable blow against Russian interest, especially its large and profitable military industry.

If Turkey can sell its drones, laser defences and top tech missiles to Azerbaijan, It can also sell it to Ukraine. If Ukraine uses the drone technology that heavily defeated the Armenian military, it can be a game-changer in terms of the region's military balance.

Turkey is in all aspects, becoming a strong power when it comes to weapon development.  It laser weapons research is on track to rival both the US and Chinese research, and Turkey has enough potential conflicts to test and use those weapons for trials.

**A clash between titans emerging?**

The Turkish buy of the Russian S-400 missile system created shockwaves in NATO. However, this system's tactical use seems limited for much of the country's geopolitical purposes. Some analysts say it might have more to do with Erdogan's paranoia and grand ambition of New Turkey. It primary batteries are reportedly being deployed to defend the new Presidential Palace against potential enemies westward. It does, however, raises a question of what ambition Erdogan and Turkey have in the future. Adding non-NATO weapons to its arsenal might state that it is ready to push on with other regional conflicts.  With Nagorno war cooling down and providing a substantial moral and cultural victory for Turkey and its ally in Baku, Ankara might now have the momentum and self-esteem to move ahead against Greece supremacy in the Aegean sea. Such a power grab will create shockwaves in all directions of the black sea. Russia, in this case, can seize an opportunity to advance on a NATO civil war. Russia did get a minor setback and diplomatic defeat in the regional battle of Caucasus. Its silences in the first part of the conflict, followed by a passive statement about Armenian territorial integrity as a red line put a dent and showed weakness in the world. Many countries could ask themselves why they should be part of the CSTO if the leading country will not aid when someone attacks. An essential question that Minsk is asking right now. If Russia is to get on the offensive now where can it show muscles?

**The waterways of Crimea**

When Russia invaded Crimea, they stopped where the peninsula ended. However, the water arrived from the rivers of Dnieper, and logically Ukraine turned off the dams and the canal. This action dried up the reservoirs, and since then, the issue of water has been a constant question for Crimea. Although Russia has pressured and tried to pay Ukraine to provide water, the problem is so sensitive that even trying to get a public opinion can create frictions.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tried to probe public opinion regarding unblocking the North Crimean Canal. Still, under public criticism, he was forced to back down and declare that water supplies to Crimea will only be possible after Ukraine regains control of the peninsula.

There has been speculation on a Russia military annexation of the waterways; however, analysts have seen this as an improbable scenario  for three reasons:

1. The cost unweights the benefits. Russian military needs to launch a campaign to take 70 km of Ukrainian territory upriver with the beachhead being the small roads from the Crimean peninsula,  against a better equipped and trained Ukraine than six years ago.
2. The sanctions towards Russia will increase and push Kyiv further towards NATO and Turkey, who most likely will not hesitate to send aid and arms.
3. The canal has deteriorated the last six years as it is not in use. There is no guarantee that Ukraine can not destroy the infrastructure, and even if they get hold of the canal, it will demand lots of resources to make sure that the water does not get lost in transmission.

For now, Russia drives the water from the Kerch Bridge. However, Russia has invested and planned seawater desalination plants to provide Crimea water to solve the problem. If it is going to be economically viable is another question.

Thought I'd share some quotes;

---

> In today’s open-society Europe there are no borders; European people can be readily replaced with immigrants; the family has been transformed into an optional, fluid form of cohabitation; the nation, national identity and national pride are seen as negative and obsolete notions; and the state no longer guarantees security in Europe. In fact, in liberal Europe being European means nothing at all: it has no direction, and it is simply form devoid of content. Furthermore, Ladies and Gentlemen, liberal democracy has undergone a transformation. Liberal democracy has been transformed into liberal non-democracy. The situation in the West is that there is liberalism, but there is no democracy.

> The argument we can provide to support our assertion that there is an absence of democracy is that in Western Europe censorship and restrictions on freedom of speech have become general phenomena. Working together, political leaders and technology giants filter news items that are uncomfortable for the liberal elite. If you don’t believe this, just visit these websites, visit social media sites, and you’ll see the ingenious and cunning means by which they restrict access to negative news reports on migrants, immigrants and related topics, and how they prevent European citizens from facing reality. The liberal concept of freedom of opinion has gone so far that liberals see diversity of opinion as important up until the point that they realise, to their shock, that there are opinions which are different from theirs. Liberals’ vision of press freedom reminds us of the old Soviet joke: “However I try to assemble parts from the bicycle factory, I end up with a machine gun.”

> I have formulated five tenets for the project of building up Central Europe. The first is that every European country has the right to defend its Christian culture, and the right to reject the ideology of multiculturalism. Our second tenet is that every country has the right to defend the traditional family model, and is entitled to assert that every child has the right to a mother and a father. The third Central European tenet is that every Central European country has the right to defend the nationally strategic economic sectors and markets which are of crucial importance to it. The fourth tenet is that every country has the right to defend its borders, and it has the right to reject immigration. And the fifth tenet is that every European country has the right to insist on the principle of one nation, one vote on the most important issues, and that this right must not be denied in the European Union. In other words, we Central Europeans claim that there is life beyond globalism, which is not the only path. Central Europe’s path is the path of an alliance of free nations. This is the task, the mission extending beyond the Carpathian Basin which lies ahead of us.

> So these were the calmer waters. Now let’s sail out of Lake Balaton, so to say, and out onto the open seas. Let us look at what has happened in the world around us over the past year. First of all, the US president has made good on his promises. You may remember how the European elite dismissed the US president’s goal to transform the multilateral world order – the world order based on multilateral agreements – into a system based on bilateral agreements. Let us acknowledge that he started this in the past year, is making systematic progress with the precision of an engineer, and a new world political and economic order based on bilateral agreements is unfolding before our eyes. In the past year the other major development in the world around us has been the continuing march and growth of China.

> The third important circumstance that we must take into consideration is that the Russians have also delivered on their promise – one which, of course, was dismissed by representatives of the European liberal elite, just as they had dismissed the Americans’ promise. And the Russians have taken action: they are close to resolving the supply of gas to Europe, while bypassing Ukraine. The Nord Stream II pipeline will soon be complete, and the plans for the TurkStream project are already on the table.

> The fourth important thing that has happened in the past year is that Europe’s shift to the right has continued: it has become clear that this is not just a Central European process. Let us think back to the results of the German federal election – or the Austrian and Italian elections, for that matter. We can see that a shift to the right is a general trend across the whole of Europe. I mention these developments because for us – a country of ten million people and a nation of fifteen million – it is absolutely crucial to understand what is happening around us. We must face up to the fact that for a country of our nature and size, the risks and consequences of making mistakes are much greater than they are for heftier countries.

> The Americans will continue their attempts to preserve their leading role in the world, and to successfully compete with China. Let’s not forget that demographically China has a four-fold advantage, internal stability, and a technologically advanced and modern economy; this means that time and tide are moving in its direction. The Americans don’t want to resign themselves to this, and have realised that if things continue as they did under their previous presidents, there will be a predictable final outcome. They have just one chance: they want to change the international rules of the game. No one can yet know whether they will succeed – particularly whether they will succeed in doing so without armed conflict; but we can be sure that this is a firm and determined intention that will shape world politics. Therefore, as part of the effort to change the rules of the game, they will try to eliminate the trade surplus that currently exists in Europe’s favour. This is the essence of the clashes pointing to a trade war between the European Union and the United States. They will come to an agreement with the Russians on arms control: there will be a Russian-American agreement. 

> There are European Union countries which do indeed have every reason to feel that they’re living every day of their lives under constant threat to their security. These countries are the Baltic states and Poland. This feeling is justified – both by geography and history. At the same time, it is completely clear that Hungary does not perceive such a threat, that Slovakia does not perceive such a threat, that the Czechs do not perceive such a threat, and neither does Western Europe. And we also have good reason to feel this way. Clearly there is no single policy which is good for everyone. Therefore it would be better if NATO and the European Union provided extra, heightened security guarantees to Poland and the Baltic countries, and if at the same time the rest of Europe was finally allowed to trade [with Russia], to build economic cooperation, and to incorporate raw materials, energy and prospects for trade into its set of opportunities for economic development.

> The whole of Europe depends on whether Turkey, Israel and Egypt are stable enough to curb and halt the Muslim influx coming into Europe from that region. If any one of these three countries loses its stability, there will be serious security consequences for the whole of Europe. Just think back to all the consequences we saw when Egypt briefly lost its stability as a result of the Arab Spring. But this is also true of Turkey. Whether or not you like its president, whether or not you sympathise with his political regime, one thing is certain: we need a stable Turkey protecting us against the uncontrolled rising tide of migrant masses. We can say the same of Israel: without Israel a geographical area of radical Islam would develop, which Europe could only see as a threat. So it is in our interest for these countries to remain stable, and to have stable political regimes and leaders.

> For Europe a single conclusion follows from this. In such a complex and volatile international situation we cannot continue to live as we have done up to now. It is absurd for Europe to be unable to create the forces necessary for its own defence. We cannot continuously live off the Americans’ money, and under their security umbrella. It’s good if they’re here, we need them and we need NATO; but Europe must have its own independent defence capability, and so we will need a European army. We have the necessary funds, we have the technological foundations; all that is lacking is the political will. In the period ahead we must create that will.

> And finally I’d like to say a few words about Europe. This will be the roughest ride, so please fasten your seatbelts. Regarding the coming year, Ladies and Gentlemen, I can tell you that if we take a look at Europe, we can see that it was once a great civilisation. Europe was once a power centre that shaped the world. This was so because it dared to think, it dared to act, it was brave, and it embarked upon great endeavours. If we look at one civilisation or another from a spiritual perspective – and there is a branch of literature devoted to this – we can conclude that civilisations are comprised of four things. Civilisations are entities of a spiritual nature. They are formed from the spirit of religion, the spirit of creative arts, the spirit of research and the spirit of business enterprise. These are the spirits that can form a civilisation. If now we look at our Europe, in terms of the spirit of religion we see that it has rejected its Christian foundations. In terms of the spirit of creative arts we see that there is censorship, and political correctness is forced upon us. In terms of the spirit of research, we can say that the US has overtaken our Europe, and soon China will also have done so. And as regards the spirit of business in Europe, we can say that instead of the spirit of business, today Brussels and economic regulations are ruled by the spirit of bureaucracy. These processes, Ladies and Gentlemen, started long ago, but they only became sharply defined against the background of the 2008 crisis.

> Let me take a complex thought and simplify it: we must face up to the fact that Europe’s leaders are inadequate, and that they’ve been unable to defend Europe against immigration. The European elite has failed, and the European Commission is the symbol of that failure. This is the bad news. The good news is that the European Commission’s days are numbered. And I have counted them: it has some three hundred days left before its mandate expires. The Commission is an important body in the European Union, and its decisions have serious consequences for the Member States – including Hungary. The fact is that, according to the founding treaties, the Commission is the guardian of the treaties: the treaties establishing the European Union. It must therefore be impartial and unbiased, and it must guarantee the four freedoms. Instead of this, today the European Commission is partisan, because it sides with the liberals. It is biased, because it is working against Central Europe. And is not a friend of freedom, because, instead of freedoms, it is working towards building a European socialism. We should be happy that its days are numbered. Now we should ask ourselves why the European elite – which today is exclusively a liberal elite – has failed.

(paywalled)

A plea from 33 writers: Please use language that will clarify the issues at hand.

Please stop using the Latin phrase “quid pro quo” regarding the impeachment inquiry. Most people don’t understand what it means, and in any case it doesn’t refer only to a crime. Asking for a favor is not a criminal act; we frequently demand things from foreign countries before giving them aid, like asking them to improve their human rights record.

That is not a crime; the crime is President Trump’s demand for something that will benefit him personally. But using this neutral phrase — which means simply “this for that” — as synonymous with criminality is confusing to the public. It makes the case more complicated, more open to question and more difficult to plead.

Please use words that refer only to criminal behavior here. Use “bribery” or “extortion” to describe Mr. Trump’s demand to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, making it very clear that this is a crime. The more we hear words that carry moral imputations, the more we understand the criminal nature of the act.

Please also stop using the phrase “dig up dirt.” This slang has unsavory connotations. Instead, please use the more formal, direct and powerful phrase “create false evidence,” or “find incriminating evidence” or the simpler “tell lies about.”",Freethought,Ukraine

1. In the global warming world, Siberia will provide vast amounts of arable lands, so that China can finally become food sufficient.
2. All the natural resources therein that China needs: natural gas, oil, precious metals, even just the wood for logging and construction.
3. A port on the Arctic Sea: in the warming world, the Arctic Sea may become a year round warm water port. If this is true, then a port on the Arctic Sea will allow China to sling its shitty goods to the world for half the transportation costs, because 80% of the world lives in the Northern Hemisphere, and will allow China to skip the Western controlled Indian Ocean and east/western Pacific Rim.

The invasion is also much easier than an amphibious assault on Taiwan for the following reasons:

1. China has never amphibiously done anything. However, it has plenty of experience rushing across a land border and pushing to the end (Korea War, lesser extent Vietnamese War).
2. Russia's defenses and reinforcements can be crippled by merely shutting down a few railways, which China can decimate with its Rocket Force and hypersonic missiles.
3. The West is not going to help Russia resist China as much as it would help Taiwan, if it even offers Russia any aid at all.
4. China has causus belli, at least to Russia, for the same reasons that Russian justified its invasion of Ukraine. China actually has a stronger claim here, because the Asian populations in Siberia are much more friendly to their Chinese neighbors who they trade with than the Slav overlords in Moscow, that only pay attention to them when it needs warm bodies for some foreign European conflict. China can legitimately claim that it is liberating oppressed ethnic Chinese peoples from Russian oppression.

I'm a citizen from a NATO country and absolutely denounce Putin's actions in this moment. However after seeing so many passionate Americans discussing this topic I urge you Americans to read this from every other country in NATO's perspective, as many of my European friends know most Americans are all brainwashed the same way:

Talking about the war in Ukraine yes Putin is evil, but extreme restraint has been shown towards inflicting civilian casualties - from the fact we saw that video of a single guy blocking tanks tienamin square-esque, the dude who punched a russian soldier in the face (just to not get punched or anything back but a warning shot into the ground) - the fact 2 of the missiles hitting apartment buildings had mapped trajedectories showing they were near-misses of actual military points of importance, etc are all in favor of the Ukranian people.

Putin's use of artillery has 99% so far been to barrage only military-entrenched positions (some of which sadly are amid civillians, so yes civilian life is being lost, but not targetted - the importance is the targetting of military assets) is something to note.

I hate Putin and hope Russia loses, but If he really wanted mass bloodshed, we'd see artillery barrages over every civillian point of interest to conflict collateral damage to get Ukraine to surrender. Also I come from a NATO country but let's be real here, USA intentionally went into middle-east knowing there were no WMDS and PURPOSELY targeted hospitals, schools, kindergardens etc for 'shock and awe'.

Once again fuck Putin, but atleast unlike the USA leaders, he shows restraint. I hope Ukraine\* wins, but I hope the USA sheeple come to understand just how much propaganda THEY consume (once again Im white and from a NATO country - just saying truths) and maybe wake up to the fact that the USA military is more willing to shed blood, than even the Russian military.

The only difference is the lens upon which the propaganda we're seeing is. Russia is invading Ukraine for oil (it's proven look it up srsly) just as USA invaded middle east for oil. The world is fucked. I wish the American people can come to respect middle-eastern civillian lives as much as Ukrainian lives. Anyways rant over, hoping the best for Ukraine.

To all of you Americans who are going to passionately defend and rationalize every which way killing 100,000+ innocent middle-eastern people PURELY in the pursuit of oil please sit and think to yourself - are you so racist you reckognize Ukranian people as humans but not middle-eastern people? Or are you too stupid and brainwashed to understand the USA government purposely destroys KINDERGARDENS and HOSPITALS to DESTABILIZE regions in the pursuit of oil, where as yes fuck Russia, but they are mostly focused on MILITARY targets, not ""shock and awe"" tactics.

I am not an American

So I don't know much about american politics but some time back I posted a video of Tulsi gabbard saying that America and EU could have prevented this russia ukraine war from happening by saying that ukraine will never be a NATO member which is true the war wouldn't even start if ukraine didn't resist russia for joining NATO before the war and the funny part is after the war started they said that okay we will not join NATO

So this statement was given by Tulsi Gabbard on Fox news and I posted this video here :- [https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/hmmm/)

and Immediately people didn't even try to understand the point made by her and Immediately cancelled her with personal comments and saying that it is Fox news and I am thinking that so what ? how does it matter that the statement was given on fox news or on any other news channel the point made by her sounded very valid to me the only sensible comment I could find there was this [https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/comment/hz1njnv/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/t4qz8v/comment/hz1njnv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
