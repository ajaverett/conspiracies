Please get this through your heads, 

None of that matters! IT DOESN’T fucking matter ok? We are all being still being dicked by the same people and same fucking organizations, and the same slave system. People seem to forget how many other players are involved in this game or theatre if you like, you still got China, Russia, U.N., Vatican, Intelligence agencies, media, banking cartel, Hollywood, Council of Foreign Relations, Rockefeller’s, Rothschilds, Israel Mossad... I could go on for days about how many problems the world has, but the point is it doesn’t really matter who you voted for, the show will go on according to plan regardless of your opinions and votes, because it has been planned.The problem isn’t just the players, it’s The WHOLE game, the other teams, coaches, umpires,
Referees, etc.

People are so deluded that they think Trump is going to bring down the whole cabal, stop the great reset, and mass vaccinations, and bring down the media, Vatican, China, U.N., lock up Bill Gates and the Rockefeller’s etc..
I’m sorry but the show is going to go on whether we like it or not, because the other players and “coaches” or handlers in the game still want to play, and they don’t give an ants dick who is selected, because they know the game is rigged in their favor. They don’t even care about the environment, what makes you think they care about you?
You think your that special they care about your wellbeing? That’s cute...

So don’t take this republican / democrat / conservatives stuff too seriously. These are all labels, they are constructs made by man, all they do is separate and divide us. They are all tools of the elite to control and manipulate you and play with your emotions.

Even if Trump is re-elected, you can bet on your life that the game plan would still continue. Because there’s Too many players that want it too continue, they have invested a lot of time and money and aren’t ready to lose it that easily.

The show must go on...

3,"One of the most important interviews on the Internet just got even more important, because of the pandemic, now the jigsaw of the plan for the future is almost complete, and the head architects are surely the Rockefeller Family.",5221.0,fs4sxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fs4sxj/one_of_the_most_important_interviews_on_the/,1180.0,1585622275.0,"First here's a brief version of the post summed up quickly:-

1. Decades ago a highly credible investigator, Norman Dodd, discovered that the tax-exempt foundations e.g. Rockefeller Foundation etc, wanted to make changes to society, and their tool of choice (at that time) was war.

2. The tax-exempt foundations said they would continue to use war until they had other effective methods for making major societal changes.

3. 10 years ago, a high-level Rockefeller document described details of other methods for influencing how the world evolves, one such scenario which was suggested in the document was a pandemic.

4. What societal changes do the Rockefellers desire? 
A former Rockefeller family friend blew the whistle on the plans the Rockefellers had for the future.  He was told they want everyone chipped for tracking and to buy/sell.  If they don't like you they will turn off your chip to make it incredibly difficult for you to function in society.

Conclusion:-  The Rockefellers no longer rely on war to make changes in the world, now they have other tools at their disposal, such as pandemics.  Their goal is take away our freedoms, then if we want them back we'll be forced to receive vaccines to gain a digital certificate of movement which allows us to be tracked on 5G control grids. Over time it will be placed onto a chip, which will be hard to avoid. By then society will be cashless, making life without a chip a struggle, almost impossible.

Chief suspects for causing this pandemic = Rockefeller family and their many proxies.

Longer version with more detail:-

[This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RgRGWlDo70) with the late [Norman Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Dodd) was already viewed as one of the most important on the Internet.  If you haven't seen it before, you really must add it to your list.  Dodd was the chief investigator of the Reece Committee, his job was to look into the tax-exempt founds e.g. Rockefeller Foundation, and to find out what they were actually up to.  In the interview he explains that the foundations are really there to make changes in the world, and that the only way they know how to make changes is through war, so their job is really to start wars.  Since war was the only effective method they knew for making major changes, they would continue to use it until they had other equivalently effective methods.  

10 years ago the [Rockefeller Foundation released a scenario document, Page 18](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf), where they looked into different scenarios which could influence the way in which our world evolves, one of the scenarios analyzed was a pandemic.  So what we're seeing here, is that over the decades the Rockefeller Foundation has moved on, they no longer rely on war as a tool to make changes, now they have new tools at their disposal, like pandemics, making them the chief suspects as to who has placed the world into the current pandemic scenario.

Now, you may be wondering what kinds of changes the Rockefellers want to make to society, well one of their [former friends blew the whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzzBix1NdU) in a video of similar importance to the Norman Dodd interview.  Aaron Russo was a filmmaker and a close friend with one of the Rockefellers.  Aaron was told their secret plans for the world, which included everyone being micro-chipped in a cashless society, where one requires an implanted micro-chip for buying and selling.  If TPTB didn't like what you were doing they could switch off your chip, making it almost impossible for you to function in society.

So, as Bill Gates (who is allied with the Rockefellers) recently [admitted on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/), the plan is for people to have digital certificates of movement, Germany is calling them [antibody certificates](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-germany-covid-19-immunity-certificates-testing-social-distancing-lockdown-2020-3?r=US&IR=T).  It's very easy to see how these digital certificates of movement, initially on your smart phone, will eventually be installed on implanted micro-chips, in case you lose your phone and for your convenience, they will say.  You won't be allowed in society without one, as they will claim you may spread a virus, for you to be allowed out in public they will force you to have this, which also means receiving the vaccines and whatever ingredients eugenics enthusiasts Gates and the Rockefellers decide to put in them.

Last but not least, the 5G control grid which is being rapidly rolled out is there to track your movement by connecting with the digital certificate/chip, this is why 5G is being prioritized despite there being so much public resistance and unknown health risks.  While 4G was similar, it is nowhere near as fast and cannot make as many connections, with 5G they can track us in real time.

How can the Rockefellers be stopped?  

The perfect thing about their plan is that they can keep on attacking us with wave after wave of pandemic until we give in.  That means to stop them we need high level people in the world to get onboard, deciding enough is enough.  There needs to be arrests and all their essentially terrorist operations must be shut down once and for all, the Rockefellers and Mr Gates can no longer be tolerated as being above the law.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

Where the only food will be genetically modified or synthetically lab produced. Meat and naturally grown food will only be for the globalists. People need to open their eyes.

I stand with the Dutch farmers  💪🏻

They are fighting against the WEF who are taking steps to seize their land by stopping them farming.

Meanwhile in SRI LANKA -  The newly installed WEF President is simply more of the same. He has vowed to crackdown on ‘fascist’ protests. He means his own people, desperately trying to stop the globalist experiment that was originally responsible for destroying farming and their economy. 

Bill Gates and his WEF friends are infiltrating and buying up farms around the world, while Western governments are bribing farmers to retire.

In July 2019, the WEF explained how global farming can take on climate change. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/agriculture-climate-change-solution/

*How's the protecting jobs part going*? https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-to-fight-climate-change-in-agriculture-while-protecting-jobs

Apparently, across these two articles, we need to ""re-examine"" (in 2019) the relationship between agriculture and climate and begin a ""just transition"" to new forms of agriculture, embodied in principle in the Green New Deal. *How's that going*? 

The video is about Germany's ""Just Transition"" to a life after coal. *How's that working out*? https://youtu.be/9EmsA7wG2lo

The second article links to this Malthusian charmer, which openly advocates for lowering fertility rates, among other suggestions. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/how-to-sustainably-feed-10-billion-people-by-2050-in-21-charts

I quote *""2. limiting meat consumption to 52 calories per day by 2050""* and *""4. Achieve replacement level fertility rates""*?

**They've been planning this disaster for a while!** https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/our-food-system-is-at-risk-of-crossing-environmental-limits-here-s-how-to-ease-the-pressure

Check out the section on *""stronger regulation of water and fertilizers""*. If they cant buy your farm, they'll make it prohibitively expensive to produce or operate. Only corporately ran farms will be eligible for support, at least until they collapse the privately owned ones. 

Another reason why they wanted lockdowns, most small businesses operate in the food and restaurant sector, bankrupting these small businesses limits everyone's availability of food at the same time it stops the farmer selling to the restaurant, interrupting this self sustained micro economy. 

This is just from WEFs own website, I hope this answers any doubts on the ensuing food collapse! When one company holds so much power, but comes from the richest and oldest families of the world. You need to question what their agendas are! Controlling the media, farming, land, banking, medications, food supply and now plagues. **Wake up**!",conspiracy,Bill Gates

For all is not necessarily *what it seems.* In fact, I suggest that you take heart in the fact that what is coming, is *so much more* incredible and amazing beyond your wildest dreams. Here’s what it really is:  

**The short version:** Humanity is now “officially” in the process of its long-prophesized *spiritual awakening.* Right from the Mayans tellingly ending their calendar in the year 2012 to ideas such as *“The second coming of the Christ”* (in Christianity), *Qiyāmah* in Islam and *Satya Yuga* in Hinduism and the like (in other religions), it has been foretold that humanity will one day be freed from those very forces of darkness that have enslaved and occupied their beautiful world for millennia. While the religious books and descriptions mentioned above have been corrupted (by the powers-that-be) to indicate things other than those *of the* ***TRUTH*** – it nevertheless stands that the time for humanity’s mass awakening, is just about NOW.  

**The long version:** Ask yourself – does humanity seem like a *happy species* to you by any means? What part of living in democracy (or communism or whatever) do you *really like?* The education? The financial freedom? The fundamental human rights? The safety? The warmth? The peace? The love?

Alas! You have absolutely *none* of that good shit here! You are – and have been made – slaves to a system that seeks to exploit you day in and day out. Your hard earned money is funnelled into wars – that’s murdering people by the way – and those who declare those wars live in great wealth, prosperity and joy. And supporting those murders makes you all *patriotic* and *honourable* and all that shit. Everything and everyone from your cops and your politicians -- to your media, pharma industry, petroleum industry, justice system, corporates, military, religion, educational system and *absolutely everything else there is* seeks only and ONLY to ENSLAVE you, EXPLOIT you, RAPE you, PLUNDER you, and DESTROY AND TAKE AWAY *every single thing* that your heart truly yearns for and *stands for.*  

Hate takes the place of love. Fear takes the place of joy. Mediocrity replaces creativity and anger replaces compassion.  

THIS is NOT who YOU are. In fact, what you are is a CREATOR BEING. A being that is powerful enough to create ENTIRE UNIVERSES AT WILL – even though such seems to be a ridiculous statement to hear at this moment.  

Nevertheless, most of humanity has long been asleep to the existence of the chains that have been wrapped around its neck for millennia – and that have recently been getting tightened day by day – because your *masters* have been forewarned of something that may cause them something of a headache.  

Alas, TRUTH cannot be stopped just because it is inconvenient to one, and therefore, both – humanity as well as those who have enslaved it – are in for something of a *rude shock.* And the *ONE AND ONLY ONE* way for humanity to make it through this crisis is by TRAINING THEIR MINDS to make them more peaceful, more loving, more compassionate, more forgiving, more wise, more blissful and more POWERFUL. And time’s running out *a little too fast* for all of that, folks.  

What some of you are experiencing as reality “popping out” or looking clearer, sharper and in better colour is basically the same effect as that which one experiences during an acid trip. It is the effect that is caused when ALL FILTERS placed upon every human being’s mind (by the powers-that-be) begin to come off. And reality is seen for what it TRULY IS.  

Much like the dream and the dreamer are ONE (all *lucid dreamers* will get this) – in much the same way, YOU and your EXTERNAL REALITY are ONE. You are one and the same thing – and joined at the root – much like different fingers belonging to the same hand are all joined to the same SINGULAR body. That body is what some have called *God.*  

What you are experiencing now, is your return to that very UNITY consciousness. A consciousness, in which you CAN AND WILL (ultimately) experience ONENESS/UNITY with ALL of that reality that you deem to be *""outside"" of yourself.* For everyone you meet, is indeed, an aspect of YOU. Kind of like what they said in [**The Egg**](https://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) – its video version [**can be found** ***here***]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI).  

Now obviously, those who represented darkness aren’t gonna give up here without a fight. The *Coronavirus* was their final and very last weapon (aimed at destroying *all of humanity*) in retaliation. Needless to say – it’s not working *as damn well* as they intended it to. And it’s *too late now* for them to prevent their own impending demise *now*. (And yes, we've indeed had some help here from, ""high places"" etc. * wink wink *).  

So in the months and the years to come – EVERY SINGLE LIE told by them will be exposed. ALL corrupt people and individuals and agencies working against mankind will be exposed and ousted. Humanity will once again begin coming together in love, peace, co-operation, abundance, joy and harmony. It is our *destiny* to experience this.  

INCREDIBLE hidden technologies will be revealed that will make ALL of life a cakewalk for ALL of us. People will live longer and healthier and happier lives. Lack of money and/or poverty won’t EVER be a problem ever again. ALL pollution will be erased. ALL THINGS that are fucked up within our worlds from shitty education systems to shitty religious structures and shitty what-have-yous would be erased for good – ***once and for all.*** There will be ***NO MORE*** **human exploitation.** It will be *our ""happily ever after""* – this time for *good.* And, oh yes, it will *AT LAST* be revealed to the public that we aren’t really all alone in this endless AF universe after all. And that we never really *were* alone in the first place to even as much as begin with. *What fun!*  

The next few months and years will be something of a ""bumpy ride"" – and will bring to light some INCREDIBLY DARK AND DISTURBING FACTS about what has been going on upon this planet since an EXTREMELY LONG period of time. At such times, when you find yourselves angry, simply forgive and move on – no matter *how difficult* it gets. For you can’t do much to change the past. The future, however, that’s something you can TOTALLY look forward to. And you’ll soon begin seeing some exciting new technological (and other) developments being released -- that have been purposely held back from humanity from a long, loooong time by those wishing to *use us* and *keep us enslaved.* Stay focused on *that,* it’s just *better.* (Besides, what *energy* you focus on, you only continue to get *more of* in your life. So yeah, choose your thoughts, your beliefs and your focus *wisely!*) .

Keep this link copied with you and **feel free to share it** with any of your friends or loved ones who are scared, confused, and/or have no clue as to *what the fuck in all living hell* is breaking loose right now. Because they’re gonna be needing that shit, just about *right, fucking, now.*

# Jeff Bezos Family

**Jeff Bezos**' ***""Illuminati""*** pedigree is less well known that Bill Gates, but potentially much more interesting.

Jeff Bezos comes from some prominent Texas families.

His ancestors include the **Kings, Halls, and Gises**, among others.

The King Family were once the largest landholders in Texas. The Bezos, Gise, King Extended Family Clan made their first fortune over 100 years ago by raising Cattle.

In the 1930s, a few years after Oil was found in Texas, the Kings made their second fortune. (The cows they owned, standing around on all of those Texas pastures, had oil under their hooves.) In about 1933, the largest Oil Rights contract at the time was signed by Humble Oil (since absorbed into **Exxon**) and the Kings.

In the 1950s, geologists looking for Texas oil also found Uranium. The King/Gises owned vast swaths of land in Eastern Texas, where the uranium was found.

If that is not considered awesome luck, then having a Grandfather at an executive level position at the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), at the time was.

**Lawrence Preston (LP) Gise**, was the grandfather of Jeff Bezos. He helped build the AEC into a 30,000 person bureaucracy by the early 1960s.

So, long before the Bezos/Gise (King & Hall) Clan made their billions from the Internet, they had the accumulated wealth from, **Cattle, Oil, and Uranium.**

**LP Gise is a very interesting guy.** Besides being the **Grandfather of Jeff Bezos,** his relatives pop up in 20th Century history if one looks hard enough. There is a Gise who graduated from the Naval academy with other sons of illustrious families, such as the Symingtons. A few Gises attended a 1920s wedding in Cotulla Texas, where the future **President Johnson** was in attendance.

It also looks like Lady Bird Johnson might have been a co-investor in the Uranium mining business with the Gises, back in the 1950s. Finally, we are still looking for any information about the second wife of the **Father of Lady Bird Johnson.** The Father of Lady Bird was married at least three times. His second wife was named **""Beulah.""** There is a Beulah Gise that is in the right age bracket to be a bride of Lady Bird's Father. We would like to find out if Beulah Gise was the second wife, or not (so we can move on.)

Finally, concerning Jeff Bezos Grandpa, LP Gise. He was a founder of **ARPA**, the predecessor of **DARPA,** which pretty much invented the Internet.

**Does anyone not think Jeff Bezos may have had a little help getting Amazon out of his ""garage""?**

18,An Open Letter to Everyone who has forever Mocked us Conspiracy Theorists,3374.0,conhke,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/conhke/an_open_letter_to_everyone_who_has_forever_mocked/,1397.0,1565470350.0,"You called us names. You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

According to [this article by Business Insider,] (https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-bill-gates-net-worth-spending-2018-8#gates-reportedly-pays-to-have-sand-imported-from-st-lucia-in-the-caribbean-to-the-shore-surrounding-his-house-18) Gates has sand imported from St. Lucia in the Caribbean for his $125 million estate in Washington. Is that good for greenhouse emissions? My sheep brain barely understands any information that doesn't come from authorities with a monopoly on violence. 

Gates also has a 4.5 acre ranch in Florida with a 12,800 square foot mansion. Does the radiation emitting from Bill Gates' nuclear powered super brain generate the electricity needed to air condition year round a 12,800 square foot mansion in Florida? 

He also has another 228 acre ranch in California, a 492 acre ranch in Wyoming, and he also ""treated his family to a Mediterranean vacation on board the 439-foot superyacht Serene, which he chartered for $5 million a week. It included a helicopter.""

But I guess us plebs need to walk to our happy citizen work camp and eat powdered grasshoppers? 

Gates in his new book warns that, [""Getting to zero will be really hard. Because every plan to achieve anything starts with a realistic assessment of the barriers that stand in your way.""] (https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-new-climate-book-is-finally-here?WT.mc_id=20200214180000_HTAACD_BG-TW_&WT.tsrc=BGTW)

Oh cool. How do you eliminate barriers, Bill? ""We have some solutions we need to deploy in a big way now, and we also need a lot of innovations to be developed and spread around the world in the next few decades...we have big goals for solving the problem as more national and local leaders around the world commit to doing their part.""

Oh so leaders who allegedly represent sovereign nations of sovereign people just have to do whatever you say. Got it.

I know logic and reason is tough for most people, but if you read this post as a denial of climate change or that I'm somehow advocating that nothing should be done, you're obviously trapped in ideological thinking. Suspend your ideological framework for two seconds and ask yourself: is it hypocritical for a multi billionaire with palaces all over the globe to lecture the poor about necessary sacrifices? Yes or no? Maybe the oligarch who recently became America's largest landowner has some ulterior motive behind championing climate change?

His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being ""forced"" against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more.  

The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy.  He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine.  He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn't provide any evidence either.  Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDC’s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.

Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.  

Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.

Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Maryland’s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.

Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christina’s life.""

So in short:-  

1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money
2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials
3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government
4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms
5. Rinse and repeat

That same night Jeffery Epstein flew [his private jet to Saudi Arabia](https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh-saudi-arabia-private-jet-2019-9), where he reportedly met with soon to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The meeting was about [Saudi Vision 2030](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en), which is Saudi Arabia's version of [UN Agenda 2030](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda). Epstein was very familiar with both of these initiatives as he was a member of the [Trilateral Commission who drafted the original version](https://archive.is/Sqbno) of the initiative known as Agenda 21. It is believed that these initiatives are behind the chaos we are currently living.

Trump spent his early days in office becoming friendly with Saudi Arabia, building strong relationships with its elite and [touching creepy orbs](https://i.imgur.com/1xAOQba.jpg) with them. In June of 2017 Mohammed bin Salman was [appointed Crown Prince](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed/531075/), and Trump wasted no time in congratulating him. Not everyone in SA was pleased with MBS being named crown prince, most notably prince al-Waleed bin Talal...who owned a soon to be important piece of real estate in Las Vegas.

Fast forward to October 1st 2017, when the infamous Harvest Music Festival Shooting occurred. The official story is lone gunman Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. You may remember that the story kept changing in the days that followed, and if you build off the police scanner and 911 calls ([which this website does a great job of](https://www.intellihub.com/timeline-of-hell-las-vegas-shooting/)) the story changes to multiple shooters forcing their way up the strip, shooting into multiple hotels. Also worth noting, the floors above where Paddock allegedly shot from are actually part of ""[The Four Seasons](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-guide/las-vegas-nevada/hotels/four-seasons-at-mandalay-bay)"" a separate hotel [owned by prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Bill Gates](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/13/2) (another big Agenda 2030 player) [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b1kzk/the_las_vegas_shooting_and_the_mass_arrests_in/) does a great job breaking down the Saudi involvement theory in detail. If you're looking for a TLDR instead, the theory is that Paddock was an arms dealer and personal pilot for prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who ordered an assassination on MBS who was in Vegas at the time. When the hit team realized they were compromised they killed Paddock and began shooting from his window to create a diversion. They then made there way through the chaos on the streets in an attempt to escape. This is backed up by the infamous video (which youtube kept removing) that showed a man who resembled [MBS being escorted out of the Tropicana](https://i.imgur.com/yQQW02R.png) by an armed security team. This becomes more plausible when you consider that a few weeks later Kushner made an [unannounced visit to Saudi Arabia](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/29/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-244291) which was followed by [MBS arresting several princes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html), including prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

About a year later, the news of Jammal Khashoggi's assassination broke, and fingers were immediately pointed at MBS ([something the media is hammering down toda](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html)y) Jammal Khashoggi isn't the most famous in his family though, as his uncle Adnan Khashoggi was a big time arms dealer. He had many powerful friends, one being Donald Trump, who bought [Adnan's yacht in 1987](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/trump-princess-inside-donald-trumps-lavish-86m-superyacht--34381). Around that same time Adnan Khashoggi was [involved in the Iran Contra](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=530172b9-7e7a-4933-acbc-f864f683863a) scandal with another power and familiar friend...

Fast forward to August 2019, when news broke of Jeffery Epstein's arrest. When the FBI searched his home, they found a safe full of money, diamonds, and a fake passport. The passport had Epstein's picture with a fake name, and had his residence [listed as being in Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB49DABQHs). Shortly after Vicky Ward appeared on MSNBC and claimed to have [sources that prove Epstein and Adnan's business together](https://youtu.be/Ip7VmFyGy-s?t=436), and hinted at Epstein's involvement in the Iran Contra scandal.

It is probably worth noting that a month later Jeff Bezos' phone was [hacked by crown prince MBS](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/21/21075990/saudi-arabia-crown-pince-mbs-amazon-jeff-bezos), who allegedly gained access to Bezos' phone through a Whatsapp file.

Then there's Bill Gates, which I could write a post longer than this one is so far about his shadiness. We already connected him to prince al-Waleed bin Talal, but he also has extensive ties to Jeffery Epstein. Gates denied meeting with Epstein, [despite proven records of them meeting several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnKQ4tzg7ow), including after Epstein's conviction. A lot of [money was secretly transferred](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-jeffrey-epstein-friendship-swedish-mother-daughter-meeting-2019-10) between the 2 of them, and Gate's science advisor [Boris Nikolic was named to be named backup executor of Epstein will](https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-will-bill-gates-ex-science-adviser-boris-nikolic-named-executor) 2 days before his death. Little is known about their connection, they both share a common interest in eugenics, and both had a hand in planning UN Agenda 2030. Everything else is left up to the imagination.

So if this is all connected, what was Trumps role in it, and which side was he on? He appeared to be friendly with all of these people in his early days ([pictured here with Adnan Khashoggi and Ghislanes father Robert Maxwell](https://i.imgur.com/W5uLbcY.jpg)) But in more recent years he seemed to distant himself from them. He allegedly [kicked Epstein out of Mar Lago over inappropriate behavior](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/trump-banned-jeffrey-epstein-from-mar-a-lago-for-hitting-on-girl.html), and all of them were arrested when he took office. He also seemed to declare he will not be partaking in Agenda 2030 when he told the UN General Assembly [""the future does not belong to globalists""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wJ8tdxDVgI) Maybe he turned on them, and all of these events were part of a ""battle of the elite"" that had been raging through his time in office.

>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.

>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.

>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.

>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.

>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”

>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.

>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”

>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.

>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”

>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.

>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.

>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”

>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.

>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.

>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”

>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.

>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.

>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.

>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”

>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).

>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”

>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?

>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.

>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.

>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.

>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”

>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.

>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”

>Correction: February 18, 2018
>An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.

Now the disease Smallpox was considered eradicated in the 1980s. Only 2 countries in the world hold a sample, one being the USA According to pop science however this disease is easily relocatable in a lab, or even using items from E-Bay (Im sure you all saw that story a few years back).
All this begs the question as to why the FDA approved a Smallpox vaccine in 2019 and a new drug to treat it just this year.

I believe this may be the first of several LEGITIMATE mass-casualty events that take place. Something is coming this winter. With the majority of people they want left after a cataclysm possibly infertile from the new vaccine, now you can start the mass die off with a controlled smallpox outbreak. The systems for border control, contact tracing, camps and hospitals for infected patients, mass vaccine production and distribution and vaccine tracking are already set up and now we have a real excuse for the use of them when a lethal virus is released. Smallpox will already be hard to deal with in a first world country, and the people that say the vaccine is damaging point to the third world and say wouldn't the NWO want to get rid of them first. The third world would be wiped out with a manufactured smallpox virus, would bring the world to that 500,000,000 number in the guidestone, I would say they want us at atleast less than a billion people. All that are left are just smart enough people that they can enslave, that are also infertile in large numbers from these new vaccines. But thats another story in itself.

They will ease up restrictions on COVID and people will start thinking its already over, or even if your country doesn't do that they will let the vaccinated move freely. They will release smallpox during Christmas, its probably starting right now or very soon so it starts spreading just before people move nationally and internationally for holiday celebrations. Just like C-19 it will released so that it would spreading endemically before Christmas so it becomes pandemic, although

EDIT: Came to think of it, smallpox will have to be released a lot closer to when they want it to spread with the Christmas airtraffic and interstate travel, its a lot harder to hide smallpox symptoms than a cough like Wuhan Flu.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

1. The Pandemic is initially to restrict our movement, removing our freedom.

2. To regain movement, we will require a digital certificate of movement on a smartphone (eventually on a microchip under the skin).

3. The microchip will be for buying and selling, it will be switched off if you protest TPTB.  In a cashless society you won't be able to function.

4. The 5G network is to track you, initially by your smartphone which you have to bring everywhere due to the digital certificate of movement, and eventually on your microchip.

5. End Goal - Total Enslavement, the Deep State want to own us like cattle on 5G control grids, they can switch us on and off as they wish.

Here is what [Gates said today](
https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/):-

""Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.""

The article below discusses the certificate of movement now required in France.

[Coronavirus containment: the certificate of movement on a smartphone](https://www.en24.news/a/2020/03/coronavirus-containment-the-certificate-of-movement-on-a-smartphone-practical-tip.html)

""Due to the coronavirus pandemic, France is placed in almost total containment and the population now needs a certificate to move. But not necessarily need a printer, the smartphone is enough.""

To understand the broader context of the digital certificate of movement, it's useful to go back over 10 years to an [interview with a former friend of the 'Deep State' Rockefeller family, Arron Russo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIolXnOG96g).  In the interview he exposes the plans which a member of the Rockefeller family had leaked to him in private.  One of the most important pieces of information was that in the future all humans would be required to have a microchip under their skin, and one of its main purposes would be for buying and selling.  Any individual resisting the agenda of the Deep State would have their microchip switched off, making it almost impossible for them to function in society, thereby giving The Elite immense control over the population.

Note: The Rockefeller family have also been [obsessed with pandemics](http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf) (page 18) for years [like Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDxb21qIilM).

Of course, to keep your certificate of movement valid, you'll need to keep up with your toxic social engineering vaccines, which will modify your fertility, IQ, lifespan, health etc in adverse ways, all under the guise of protecting you against various pathogens.  Both the Rockefeller's and Gates are known eugenicists, and are both heavily involved with vaccines, and both have admitted on video that they want the global population down to below one billion.

As you'll see, it is vital to resist the plans of these parasites, do not comply, if a significant % refuse to cooperate with their agenda then their agenda will fail.

TLDR - Reason for pandemic = Pretext for introduction of certificate of movement, so as we have to join vaccine social engineering program, get tracked on 5G grid and buy/sell with a microchip; fully enslaved by the Deep State.  It is essential for yourself and future generations that you refuse to comply.

moderna was about to be bankrupt because all of their cancer and heart disease mRNA drugs failed miserably in the clinic and kept killing animals. they publicly talked about a secret ""plan"" they had to turn things around. remember this is the company that never faced any scrutiny because they refused to publish ANYTHING for peer review - ala theranos.

around 2017/2018 we know ecohealth alliance (aka peter daszik) was shopping around his gain-of-function plans to get funding from agencies, including DARPA. they were declined because it was illegal, but NIH (thanks to fauci personally overriding) was happy to oblige

moderna has disclosed in the past that they expanded their pan-coronavirus vaccine program with the NIH in 2015. note that the DARPA leak indicates that SARS-COV-19, the pathogen causing COVID-19, was originally a vaccine (or its precursor virus) that escaped/released from the lab

autists on the internet have figured out that moderna in 2017 patented a synthetic amino acid sequence: CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG that encodes the furin cleavage site (i.e., why covid-19 is able to be so infectious to humans instead of just bats). here's the kicker: that sequence is IN THE GENOME OF COVID-19. if this is truly a synthetic sequence (i haven't seen anything to convince me otherwise) the chance of 16 amino acids randomly being in this order make 1 in a quadrillion look like good odds. read this paragraph again.

remember the hilarious explanation moderna publicly gave. they created their vaccine in TWO DAYS. they freely admit they took one of their existing preclinical NIH projects (for MERS) and swapped in the spike protein sequence they received directly from China/NIH. anyone familiar with drug manufacturing understands this is complete bullshit, especially given every single attempt at doing this in animals before was fraught with animal deaths. so the hilarious revelation is they pulled a bill gates and created the virus and sold the anti-virus (literally lmao - the bill & melinda foundation funded moderna $100mn for work on HIV)

this is the smoking gun that proves the virus was lab created, using NIH funds and the scaffolds originated at moderna. so moderna literally created both COVID-19 and then scammed taxpayers out of hundreds of billions of dollars by lobbying the government to force citizens to get their clotshot under threat

55,Do you people even understand why eating bugs is bad?,1577.0,vhi42y,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vhi42y/do_you_people_even_understand_why_eating_bugs_is/,766.0,1655831121.0,"If you're going to be a ""conspiracy theorist"" you need to actually have theories and understands of why ""things r bad m'kay""

So let me ask you. Why do you think eating bugs is unhealthy? Because it's gross? Because it's dehumanizing? Well, that's not good enough to the average normie plebbit user going about his day. They'll say stuff like ""well they eat bugs in south east asia!"" etc etc.

What would you reply with? I guarantee that you don't know how to respond to that.

This is the reason that eating bugs is dehumanizing and poor for your health:

Saying that certain cultures ""eat bugs"" is shaded with racism. Many of the asia countries who ate bugs have historically struggled to feed their populations so they had to resort to eating cheap carbohydrates like rice, and INSECTS for protein. This is not an ""ideal"" diet by any means and it's not like they enjoyed eating this. This did it because they had to in order to survive. Sure some people still eat them now for cultural reasons, but the original purpose of eating insects was to avoid starving to death.

Insects contain protein, but so do many things like wheat and soy. Why is protein from soy any different than protein from beef? Do you know? Will you know how to respond when some plebbitor questions you?

There is something called a DIAAS score for protein, which stands for digestible indispensable amino acid score, which basically tells you how a protein source ranks in terms of how complete it's essential amino acid profile is, and how well you can absorb them.

For example, beef, pork, and eggs are all complete profiles and rank around 1.15, whereas wheat flour and almonds are not complete profiles and rank around 0.40.

This is why eating 100 grams of wheat flour protein and 100 grams of beef ARE NOT THE SAME in terms of nutrition. You MUST explain this to people in order to get them to understand. Stop with all the ""omg did you even know bill gates bought farm land for crickets?"" they will not understand.

The shell of insects is indigestible to humans, though some animals can process it. Yes, many animals can eat bugs or only eat bugs to survive, because they have EVOLVED the processes necessary to extract the maximum nutrition out of insects. We have not, you must also explain this to people. Insects score a very low DIAAS number which is why eating insects is UNHEALTHY and should only be used to prevent starvation.

Please stop with the whole ""OMG BILL GETS AND WEF ARE LE BAD"" Yes they are bad but you need to explain why things are bad or people are just going to think you're a dumbass.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.

Promising to eradicate Polio with $1.2 billion, Gates took control of India ‘s National Advisory Board (NAB) and mandated 50 polio vaccines (up from 5) to every child before age 5.

Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017.

In 2017, the Indian Government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB. Polio paralysis rates dropped precipitously.

Evicted? Why not arrested & tried in a Court of Laws for Crime Against Humanity? The following hashtag is trending on social media: #jailBillGates

In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates’ Vaccine Program.

The most frightening epidemics in Congo, the Philippines, and Afghanistan are all linked to Gates’ vaccines. By 2018, ¾ of global polio cases were from Gates’ vaccines.

In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by GSK and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces.

Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders.

Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls.

The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.

In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a trial of a GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children.

During Gates 2002 MenAfriVac Campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis.

Between 50-500 children developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practises as “ruthless” and immoral”.

In 2010, Gates committed $ 10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. A month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”.

In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a phoney “tetanus” vaccine campaign.

Independent labs found the sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.

Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines.

A 2017 study (Morgensen et.Al.2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP is killing more African than the disease it pretends to prevent. Vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of unvaccinated children.

I have browsed this sub for a long time, but admittedly got caught up in the circus (mass psychosis) of the last couple years of political, social, civil, public health, and economic chaos. I have always had an intuitive feeling that Biden was ushered in as President by the powers that be, but went along with it because I felt that Trump was also chosen by the elite. Trump played a very important role, and now it was Biden’s turn (whether Trump was ready to go or not).

I thought, hell, might as well go along with it. Frankly, Biden’s promise of playing nice and ending COVID sounded comforting. What could he possibly do that would be so terrible? He would just remain a boring, white bread, moderately left President and not accomplish nor destroy anything significant.

Well, after yesterday’s press conference, my eyes have been completely opened. **Biden is here to oversee the fall of America as we know it.** He is here to oversee the great reset, the great awakening, whatever you want to call it. Dark times are ahead, and the powers that be have installed a puppet to mislead us, following the installation of a clown to distract us from 2016-2020.

I strongly believe that the next coming years will see great global economic, diplomatic, and societal fallout.

This includes: the worst economic crash of all time, stock market manipulation exposed, the inevitable rug pull of COVID, the public realizing that the last 2 years of their lives have been stolen from them for financial/political gain, Russia and China disturbing global sovereignty, Metaverses, cryptocurrency, and possibly much more. The economic crash will be so severe that it will be used to convince people that a great reset is NEEDED, just like 2 years of quarantines, masks, and vax were needed to stop the pandemic.

I also believe that we will continue to see the rapid cognitive decline of President Biden. I mean, I voted for the man, but yesterday’s press conference was *the single most embarrassing event I’ve ever witnessed* from the White House press floor. He was confused, delusional, misleading, out of touch, and by the end of it, there were numerous times where he was literally incoherent, unable to remember what he was saying as he was saying it.

This may or may not lead to the invocation of the 25th amendment. I’m not sure if TPTB will milk a full 4 years out of Biden or not, given Kamala’s inability to do apparently anything correct. The MSM is already turning on them both, so I’m not sure what this suggests for the impending chaos awaiting us in the next 3 years.

I have never experienced such a 180 degree revelation of my own cognitive dissonance and misinformed biases before. I feel shame, embarrassment, and anger for being conned into voting for these people. I truly believe that Biden & Harris are in place to oversee the darkest times in American history, and to divide this country further than it already is - in a completely different method than Trump’s rhetoric did.

My eyes are now open. I am now looking back at the 2020 election, the exploitation of the pandemic leading up to it, the media circus of narratives (COVID death tolls, Antifa, BLM, Proud Boys, George Floyd, Kyle Rittenhouse, presidential debates, election fraud, Jan 6th) and I see everything in a whole new perspective now. Even popular online conspiracy theory discourse all seem like orchestrated misinformation campaigns to me: Epstein, flight logs, Maxwell, Trump & Epstein, Biden sniffing kids, QAnon, Clintons, Plandemic, Bill Gates.

It's all fucking manipulated chaos and hysteria. We are living in an orchestrated sociopolitical theater, a clown circus, an amalgam of constant psyops and new world agendas. 

Why? I have absolutely no answer nor explanation. But I am seeing things that I have never seen before and I hoped to confide in this sub to share my truths.

Racism exists and Black Lives Matter, but this movement has been hijacked by powerful outside forces...isn't it odd that saying something like that could get you doxed as a racist and people are encouraged to target you?

&#x200B;

Isn't it weird that while both sides of the media seem so hell bent on using whatever they can from the protests/riots to make the other side look bad, they refuse to talk about what went down in DC on Monday. Isn't weird that after online reports of people storming the white house lawn the [media](https://i.imgur.com/Kb8Sv1Y.jpg) stopped covering it, the live streams went down, and rumors of the internet and phones of people in the area going down started spreading? Isn't it weird that news outlets called DCBlackout a Hoax, when we have a [few pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbRof2PJAts&t=3s) of [video evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1dclnslDmQ) of [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZsAmfXvyb4) going [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbNq6cna6qg). Isn't it weird that Twitter[banned accounts](https://news.yahoo.com/george-floyd-protests-twitter-bans-130446689.html) posting about it, and blasted out thousands of [identical bot posts](https://i.imgur.com/1w1JJpF.jpg)discrediting it?

&#x200B;

Isn't it weird that while the media tried to paint Bill Gates as a pandemic prophet, they never mention [Event 201](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/about) which happened in October of last year? Isn't it weird that this pandemic simulation exercise, where they frequently mentioned a new normal, was [nearly identical to Covid 19](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/scenario.html)'s response? Inst it weird that it also had a section discussing using [social media/internet blackouts](https://youtu.be/LBuP40H4Tko) to deal with civil unrest and misinformation? Does it bother you that now, with the US out, Bill Gates is the [largest donor and influence](https://www.politico.eu/article/bill-gates-who-most-powerful-doctor/) of the World Health Organization. Isn't it weird that he is such a powerful figure within the UN that has its own global governing [agenda](http://agenda21news.com/category/agenda-21/)?

&#x200B;

Have you seen the advanced [technology in military](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3OPUh2gOdo&t=26s) robotics? Imagine what they're not showing us. Have you seen the [city surveillance system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVDvJCeCe54) tested in Camden NJ in 2015? Does it bother you that 5 years ago they claimed soon every city will have it?

Knowing all this isn't it weird that there seems to be a global push to disband police forces?

Since you are reading r/Conspiracy, I assume that's a sentence you've had thrown your way by the blue pilled anti-skeptics"" out there. It's used to shut you up, mock your different viewpoints, and shame you into going along with the consensus.

But what exactly is ""The Science"" anyways? There isn't only one ""Science"" out there, and the scientific method itself requires you to ask questions and compare results. There is nothing scientific about forming a hypothesis, immediately declaring it to be true, and then shutting down any variable that goes against it. By no means does ""The Science"" get decided overnight, and the true ""Science"" evolves over  time, and changes with the revelation of new information.

Yet here we are, in one of the most volatile and divisive crisis of our lifetimes, being mandated to trust the one true science. We have big tech companies actively removing anything that goes against their science. Don't worry about those early models that were way off, forget about how we were told this virus started by someone eating a bat. It doesn't matter that big pharma has a less than stellar track record. There's nothing wrong with the fact that we went from ""masks don't provide adequate protection and should only be used for health care workers/Covid Patients"" to ""The almighty mask is your greatest defense against Covid, and not wearing one makes you a mass murderer"" It is in no way a problem that were told that ""Protesting is the most dangerous and irresponsible thing you can do"" then informed that ""If you don't take to the streets to form a giant mob you are a deplorable Nazi.""

Not about depopulation, or just giving more money to big Pharma. These are just side tabloid aspects of the real reason:

**Transhumanism. Connecting your body to the digital world.**

Yeah, this may sound crazy to a lot of you. You can stop reading here if you believe I am just a tin foil hat conspiracy nutjob. Its okay. Even I think this is some Black Mirror shit, but this is the truth, and I´ll approach it from ""official"" sources so there is no room left for doubt. 

I want to make myself clear that this is an unbiased post. I am not saying transhumanism is necessarily bad or that you are making a mistake by getting vaccinated. In fact, this is a revolutionary invention that could be used for lots of good things. Personally, I believe this transhumanist era puts beginning to a Huxleyian apocalypse, that's why I am not taking it. But it is up to you. I just want you to know what you are putting in your bodies

# 1.- Graphene 

You probably heard of people getting magnetized after their shots. Graphene oxide in the shots is not a mystery. \[it is even listed as the main component in Chinese vaccine patents\]( [https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en)). 

Graphene is a fantastic invention. A material several times more conductive than copper and that can be of 1 atom of thickness.

\[These are the words from the inventor\]([https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate](https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate)), Nobel prize winner Konstantin Novoselov, about the uses of graphene regarding this pandemic 

This is a full rabbit hole. Graphene is in everything. I am sure graphene is what Julian Assange called \[""The smart evil dust that is everywhere and in everything""\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc)). I suggest going down this rabbit hole to fully understand what is going on

Remember these vaccines are genetic technology? So, using graphene oxide as a carrier could mean maybe your DNA, your life blocks, are turning into electricity superconductors. Tiny little computers. Why?

&#x200B;

[Agenda of the Great Reset. \\""...Deliver telemedicine. Imagine what could be possible if similar concerted efforts were made in every sector\\""](https://preview.redd.it/h67jgd7cnao71.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb4dc0f560044f84d0e0fb48ab81b454f7f84c28)

Just think about the possibilities. Turning your life blocks into tiny computers

# 2.- The Great Reset 

This is an agenda of the World Economic Forum. I believe what we are living now is a biological war, a planned pandemic. The virus was designed for the vaccines, not the other way, in order to begin the shift into the digital world. It makes sense, we needed a crisis and fear of the people to comply with a universal vaccine mandate.  There is soft evidence that show you this crisis has been planned. Of course I don't have a video of Fauci or Schwab or the CCP saying "" hehe, we are going to release this virus and make everyone comply"". At this point, you have to use common sense. If you are okay with this, lets keep going.

&#x200B;

[I want to emphasize that connecting bodies and the digital world is something that the \\""elites\\"" have been talking about for a while.](https://preview.redd.it/xd80gvfqqao71.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=070f0a1405a05e56aa423dd96ade7aa2ddf7c5ff)

I suggest to you reading this article by the WEF. \[The Internet of Bodies\]([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/)).

Devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn? I´ll talk about this, but first, vax passes enter the game. If you live in a place where vax passes are active, you probably have to show a phone app QR code or the classic paper card.

 Ever heard of the \[Quantum dot tattoo?\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/)). You probably know the temperature scanners that are in every store entrance. Let me tell you by experience, these are bullshit, they don't work, they just throw random numbers. The function of these scanners is to prepare people when they actually have to scan their Quantum Dot Tattoo. I am talking about the future now, so I must stop to not lose credibility in my statements, I am just linking the dots of the ""Internet of Bodies"".

&#x200B;

[Their slogan is \\""You'll own nothing, and you'll be happy\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bz089s2lvao71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e73a5434cdad1fbdc0f961bcb1002dba9325943c)

In my opinion, this slogan is literal. 

&#x200B;

The goal is to fuse your bodies to the digital world. We are in the vaccination stages and the beginning of vax passes.

Again, this may sound crazy to a lot of you, but I hope you realize this is the goal.

**By Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Chairman, Children’s Health Defense**

APRIL 28, 2020

For many months I have remained silent in the face of defamatory and dishonest attacks against me by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai. My approach was to ignore the sniping to preserve the unity of the Health Freedom Movement. However, Shiva has expanded his malevolent campaign to include venomous salvos against our community’s most prominent and effective leaders, including Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Dr. Rashid Buttar, Polly Tommey and Samoan-Australian activist Taylor Winterstein. Because he now has some of our outstanding spokesmen in his gun-sites, and because his poisonous volleys have begun to damage the solidarity that is critical to our success, I reluctantly make this response.

**Little Lies / Big Lies**

I had never heard of Shiva when he approached me on the street following a January 6th, 2020 Trenton rally. We had a friendly chat and took a photo. [Afterward, he tweeted that I had refused to shake his hand.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Handshake-tweet-e1588101235385.jpg) [A half-dozen photos](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0706-scaled-e1588018251484.jpeg) of [us shaking hands](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7134-e1588101646604.jpg) soon surfaced, proving his statements false. It was only then that I learned he was running as a fringe candidate for U.S. Senate against my nephew, Massachusetts Congressman Joseph Kennedy. It is axiomatic that a man who lies about small things, will also lie about the large. I made a note to fact check Shiva’s assertions. I advise others to take similar precautions.

**Attacking Our Leaders**

Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Polly Tommey and Dr. Rashid Buttar are battle proven veterans deeply scarred by incalculable personal sacrifices suffered on the front-line trenches during decades of hand to hand combat against Pharma, corrupt regulators and the medical cartel. They have published, litigated, campaigned, debated, testified, strategized, organized, informed, and defended. I am proud to have served with each of them in dozens of state capitals, speaking at rallies, testifying before state legislatures, and meeting with public officials. They have emptied their personal bank accounts and, at times, ruined their health in service to our cause. They have each played indispensable roles in building the institutions that have helped us coalesce into the coherent and powerful movement that now threatens the Pharmaceutical paradigm. They have given us every reason to trust them and no reason for doubt. Shiva’s claim that these individuals are “controlled opposition” are patently absurd.

**Undermining State Health Freedom Advocates**

Shiva has viciously attacked the brilliant Health Choice Massachusetts (HCM) organizer, Candice Edwards. Edwards and her HCM co-founder, Allison Chapman lead the battle to derail the repeal of vaccine exemptions in Boston. Shiva tried to sabotage the group’s efforts, by showing up at Legislature Hearings without the science panel he had promised and delivering self-promotional testimony so loaded with insulting vulgarity and invective, that the Public Health Committee shut down the hearing, calling Shiva “a prick.” [Shiva then picked a loud fight with one of the moms accusing her of using her child for political purposes.](https://youtu.be/XWO_anzCOp8) “He threw us under the bus,” Edwards recalls. Shiva accuses Edwards of being “controlled opposition.”

**When Shiva calls Movement leaders “controlled opposition,” is he speaking of himself?**

Instead of preaching science, Shiva spends money from his Health Freedom donor base digging up dirt on other activists. Shiva employs a full-time “Negative Research” investigator, Jennifer Bennett, to excavate and invent defamatory gossip about Health Freedom Groups and their leaders in Massachusetts and nationally. In his war against our Movement, Shiva employs all the classic strategies and gambits prescribed by psychological warfare experts, in our Intelligence Services, for disrupting social reform movements when they begin to gather steam and threaten the power of entrenched vested interests.

So why, beside malignant narcissism, would a newcomer to our Movement seek to undermine our most effective and influential leaders and divide our forces? I don’t like to speculate about people’s motives, but it is a common motif among a certain species of scoundrel to project their own villainy in their slandering of others. Do Shiva’s accusations that all of us are “controlled opposition” reveal his own motivations?

Some hints to that answer may lie among the things Shiva doesn’t tell us.

**Shiva, the Vaccine Maker**

Shiva never mentions the fact that he is a vaccine maker. Shiva owns a pharmaceutical company, [Cytosolve](https://cytosolve.com/pharmaceuticals/), that [partners with vaccine and drugmakers to accelerate FDA approvals for vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve2.jpeg). His principal [business partner](https://cytosolve.com/about-us/) is [Pfizer](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-27-20-at-5.57-PM.jpg), the world’s #4 vaccine maker. Are Shiva’s attacks on our Movement calculated pandering, to court affection from Pfizer and the HHS regulators––upon whose favor his financial success relies––and to win their blessings by discrediting a Movement that questions vaccine products?

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1961.jpeg

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve4.jpeg

**Shiva’s business model requires him to court favor with vaccine companies.**

**Shiva made his money from the Clintons**

Shiva claims to have invented Email ([Smithsonian](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/va-shivaayyadurai-inventor-of-e-mail-honored-by-smithsonian/2012/02/17/gIQA8gQhKR_story.html) says Shiva’s claim is untrue and a Federal court has agreed). In fact, Shiva made his fortune [running Email operations](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) for President Bill and Hillary Clinton during the White House years. (It is ironic, therefore, that he accuses others of consorting with the Clintons). The Clinton contract propelled his company, [EchoMail](https://echomail.com/about-us/), to a [$200 million](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) [valuation.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-28-20-at-11.26-AM.jpg)

**Shiva, Partner to Microsoft**

Shiva’s [Echomail](https://echomail.com/about-us/) partner was [Bill Gates’ Microsoft](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588022140928.jpg). Even today, Shiva lists Microsoft as his partner on his EchoMail homepage. Gates, the world’s most prominent and vocal advocate for universal mandatory vaccination is also a proponent for tagging human beings with injected technologies for tracking vaccine records. Both Microsoft and Gates are leading industry efforts to develop a subdermal biometric chip system. Shiva’s success at dividing our movement and undermining and discrediting our leadership might ingratiate him with these business partners.

**Shiva and Bill Gates**

It is noteworthy that Shiva consistently mutes his criticism of [Bill Gates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/01-03-Bill-Gates-with-Vaccine_Email-e1588022386170.jpg), seeking to deflect public anger at Gates towards Hillary Clinton. This makes no sense. Hillary’s views on mandatory vaccines are abhorrent, but unlike Gates whose ownership of the WHO and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance allows him to dictate global vaccine policy, Hillary is an out-of-work politician with no political power. The Clinton Foundation is virtually defunct and bootless as an arbiter of public health policy. Why does Shiva shield Gates and insist that Hillary is the more important target?

**Shiva and 5G**

Both Gates and Microsoft hold leading stakes in the burgeoning wireless infrastructure expansion. Gates’ subdermal chip systems will be capable of meshing with Gates’ extensive new 5G antennae and satellite deployments, to harvest, not only our vaccination and medical data, but also lucrative information about our movements, our purchases, and our desires, at the granular level. [Shiva lists his other business partners as the principle Big Data Titans](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588084452529.jpg), Dell, Oracle and IBM which all stand to make a killing on the current 5G expansion. Is this why Shiva refuses to condemn 5G?

**How Does Shiva Escape Censorship?**

Shiva is the only leader in our Movement [who doesn’t suffer the Social Media censorship that bedevils the rest of us](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Both-IG2.jpg). His capacity to boost his audience, his immunity from shadow-banning and from eviction from his platforms has allowed him to exponentially expand his base, as the rest of us struggle past the censors to reach our audiences, one follower at a time. Why are Facebook, Google, and Instagram showering love on Shiva while they strangle the rest of us? Why does Silicon Valley boost Shiva and smother us?

**Shilling for Silicon Valley Big Data Billionaires**

Shiva has previous experience shilling for Big Data/Telecom. In 2010, Shiva served as front man to PayPal’s Silicon Valley titan, Peter Thiel. Thiel was campaigning to destroy Gawker in revenge for its unflattering article about himself. Thiel funded Shiva to file a defamation law suit against Gawker for reporting that Shiva lied about inventing Email. Shiva, of course, lost the law suit, but the ruinous costs of the litigation helped bankrupt Gawker, which was always Thiel’s purpose. Shiva may have discovered, from that transaction, the economic opportunities in shilling for Silicon Valley’s Big Data Barrons.

Silicon Valley is deeply entrenched with the CIA and the Pentagon in cyber-warfare efforts and in developing AI surveillance systems that can compete with the Chinese. The Silicon Valley/CIA partnership has its own secretive Federal agency, the National Security Commission, chaired by ex Google CEO, Eric Schmidt. Their strategy is to roll out 5G as a comprehensive security and surveillance superstructure that will serve as a platform for new surveillance technologies. This sinister cabal undoubtedly see the evolving Health Freedom coalition between anti 5G and anti Pharma activists as an obstacle to their ambitions.

Why Does Shiva Want to Push Democrats Out of the Health Freedom Movement?
Shiva’s insistence that Democrats disown their party, before being welcomed into the Health Freedom Movement, and his attacks on anyone who ever voted for Hillary or any other prominent Democrat, seem deliberately calculated to foment destructive partisanship and to drive Democrats from our Movement. Shiva knows that for us to succeed, our Movement requires political diversity, unity, harmony and a big tent. We welcome citizens of every nation and every political stripe. We don’t impose ideological tests or check party affiliations. I, myself, am a lifelong Democrat, but I understand that this issue must transcend party affiliations. All of our best leaders comprehend that there is no such thing as a Republican child or a Democratic child. I have worked effectively and aggressively across the nation, with Republicans—[including President Trump](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-2.04-PM-e1588023232147.jpg). Trump, who himself donated $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, did not hold my previous support for Hillary against me. He welcomed the opportunity to burnish the project’s bipartisan bona fides.

Our bipartisan approach is effective, and frightening to Pharma. Is this why Shiva is trying so hard to excite political hatred among our followers, and to polarize us along party lines?

**Can Shiva Pass his Own Ideological Test?**

Shiva’s insistence on ideological purity is ironic at best and duplicitous and deceptive at worst, given his own ambiguous political theologies. To win the top spot on the G.O.P.’s U.S. Senate ballot, Shiva persuaded Massachusetts Republicans that he was a staunch, dyed-in-the-wool Right-wing Trump supporter. [Elsewhere, however,](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.43-PM-e1588024885644.jpg) [he brags of being a committed socialist and communist sympathizer.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.42-PM.jpg) His wavering affiliations beg the question: Who is Shiva, and does he stand for anything beyond personal opportunism?

**Psy-Ops Tactics**

Shiva does not litigate, publish or fund scientific research, build institutions, treat patients, or collaborate with other leaders. He has demonstrated no inclination to work with the rest of us to build a Movement, powerful enough to confront the Big Pharma and the Big Data/Telecom tyrants. He behaves, in every instance, like a man determined to tear down all that others have built up. People who still believe in Shiva might demand to know why he chooses to spare FDA, Pfizer, Microsoft, and 5G his barbs, and to direct his poison instead at our proven leaders. Shiva seems intent on distracting Del, Mark, Rashid, Polly, Taylor, Candice and others from their important work. His sinister, treacherous and destructive rear guard action, fomenting and feeding schism, division, discord, and confusion that harms our Movement, plays directly into the hands of Big Pharma.

Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.

Promising to eradicate Polio with $1.2 billion, Gates took control of India ‘s National Advisory Board (NAB) and mandated 50 polio vaccines (up from 5) to every child before age 5. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017. 

In 2017, the Indian Government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB. Polio paralysis rates dropped precipitously.

In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates’ Vaccine Program. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, the Philippines, and Afghanistan are all linked to Gates’ vaccines. By 2018, ¾ of global polio cases were from Gates’ vaccines.

In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by GSK and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.

In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a trial of a GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children.

During Gates 2002 MenAfriVac Campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Between 50-500 children developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for drug makers” Nelson Mandela’s formar Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philantropic practises as “ruthless” and immoral”.

In 2010, Gates committed $ 10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. A month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”.

In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a phony “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found the sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade. Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines.

A 2017 study (Morgensen et.Al.2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP is killing more African than the disease it pretends to prevent. Vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of unvaccinated children.

Gates and the WHO refused to recall the lethal vaccine which WHO forces upon millions of African children annually. Global public
health advocates around the world accuse Gates of – hijacking WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases; clean water, hygiene, nutrition and economic development. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal fetish – that good health only comes in a syringe.

In addition to using his philantropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI and PATH, Gates funds private pharmaceutical companies that manifacture vaccines, and a massive network of pharmaceutical -industry front groups that broadcast deceptive propaganda, develop fraudulent studies, conduct surveillance and psychological operations against vaccine hesitancy and use Gates’ power and money to silence dissent and coerce compliance.

In this recent nonstop Pharmedia appearances, Gates appears gleeful that the Covid-19 crisis will give him the opportunity to force his third-world vaccine programs on American children.”

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

On July 8 2020, a little known document was published by The Rockefeller Foundation called “Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System”.

[https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RF-FoodPolicyPaper\_Final2.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RF-FoodPolicyPaper_Final2.pdf)

This document flew under the radar for many but is now more important than ever in the light of what has been happening to food processing facilities being destroyed globally and herds of cattle being culled.

The first question anybody should be asking is “How would the Rockefeller Foundation know about upcoming food shortages” in 2020. Naturally it was just a calculated guess on their part. Isn’t it also interesting that the title was “Reset the Table”

Surely just another coincidence considering “The Great Reset” was announced on 3rd June 2020. Amazing how they can get all their ducks in a row lined up so quickly considering Covid had only officially been on the block for a few months.

We shouldn’t be remotely surprised with the documents they publish considering in 2010 they published a document called Scenarios For The Future Of Technology and International Development in which they accurately predicted the covid outbreak. If you haven’t read the document I recommend you do. I wrote an article on it entitled

**Why Did The Rockefeller Foundation Publish A Document in 2010 That Is Eerily Similar To Events That Are Taking Place Today in Covid Times ?**

which gives a snapshot overview of the document

As I have mentioned before The Rockefeller Foundation is also deeply involved in the move to a Digital ID, cashless society and social credit score system

[**threadsirishWhy Are The World Economic Forum (WEF) & Rockefeller Foundation (RF) So Intent On Implementing A Digital ID, Digital Currency & Social Credit Score System ?Read more**6 months ago · 4 likes · threadsirish](https://threadsirish.substack.com/p/why-are-the-world-economic-forum?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)

But what about “Reset The Table”. What can we take from it ? Actually, quite a lot. Before I jump into the document itself, it’s important to look at ties to the World Economic Forum (WEF) of which there are many. Many of those who contributed to the document have conflicts of interest (Pages 21-23 of the document)

Global food companies such as Danone and Mars

Then there are the inevitable links to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Any university on the list has more than likely received funding. In the case of Tufts University who has received millions one of the funding areas is for “Agriculture Development” and “Nutrition”.

Duke University has also received hundreds of millions

You get the point at this stage. The ties are everywhere, just go to Pages 21-22 to see the full list of contributors to the report and the companies they work for.

Onto the document itself. Naturally it’s dressed up as being beneficial to mankind but once you dig deeper the truth begins to emerge of the real plans.

The one page foreword written by Dr Rajiv J Shah and especially its opening sentence is really quite telling (Page 2)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0j2y9zu62h791.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=737c975991f0d060f4ad9a45c5bf9bd398f83fd3

The finger is firmly being pointed at Covid 19 for causing many of the food problems. That’s quite amazing considering Covid had only been around for a few months when this report was written.

Shah then continues to say

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idjyi9xa2h791.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1a68e5477b5c4b7ecee1c9f60608e27fcbd557bd

Equitable and sustainable seem to be very much part of UN Agenda 2030. This comprehensive playbook he refers to would naturally include UBI as being part of the solution. They admit to trying to change the system for years but ignore the question “Cui Bono” or who benefits.

Amazingly they admit and knew back in 2020 that 94% of people dying from Covid had underlying health conditions, predominantly being diet related. (Page 3)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wssdjzlc2h791.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd8c535b2ce32e5a92ada385fc3661d6589e76b4

Let’s not forget that The Rockefeller Foundation is partly to blame for the state of food and people’s health in US over the last few decades in particular. They even admit this themselves (Page 4)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kkpyca7e2h791.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70146a5f5dfb49bf7879033dcb17be8195b073ef

The document is very much framed in the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution. Here is the problem that they have created (Covid) and now they want to implement the solution (Transforming the global food supply).

Naturally this is all ties into lands being destroyed, climate change and trying to move people back into smart cities (Page 5). Surprise, surprise.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tkxe97pg2h791.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98132325423dfe0a466fa666b1edd95f9cb1bd67

So according to the report “What is the solution”. They say they want to move from **a focus on maximizing shareholder returns** to ...a more equitable system focused on fair returns and benefits to all stakeholders—**building more equitable prosperity throughout the supply chain (Page 7)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rig4owki2h791.jpg?width=1269&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0274a1e7b4abdef4366dc226b39d3ceeb41a1b6b

There’s that term “stakeholders” which Klaus Schwab loves to use, as in stakeholder capitalism. In other words they want total control of the supply chain whilst the WEF members get richer.

How are they going to take control of the supply chain ? One of the ways is through data collection (on peoples spending and eating habits) and getting all these huge global companies (actors) who are all WEF partners to work together (Page 8).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nnf5msxj2h791.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9262bf951d1238e439a442606bbc0f22663e2492

This will be achieved by **“Success will require numerous changes to policies, practices, and norms”** (Page 8). In other words laws will have to be changed.

It is also being sold to the general public as being good for our health and food as being medicine (Page 10). Once this system is implemented you won’t get fat and sick.

&#x200B;

This is not surprising as you will be eating bugs like the World Economic Forum are planning.

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/why-we-need-to-give-insects-the-role-they-deserve-in-our-food-systems/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/why-we-need-to-give-insects-the-role-they-deserve-in-our-food-systems/)

The plan is to centralise and control the food supply into one body, one **single executive office**. Kind of has a ring to it of a “one world government”. It is interesting the reference made to 9/11. When 9/11 occurred it was for everyones safety that the Department of Homeland Security was set up. People were afraid. Problem, reaction, solution all over again and it would seem to be the same actors involved. (Page 14)

&#x200B;

This report is dressed up as being in the public interest yet it is anything but. For 2 years Covid was the focus of attention. It was Stage 1 of Agenda 2030.

The total and utter destruction of the food supply seems to now be well under way. This is all too evident especially when Fact Checkers are having to debunk the number of fires at food processing plants within the last year

[https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/unfounded-claims-about-frequency-and-causes-of-food-plant-fires/](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/unfounded-claims-about-frequency-and-causes-of-food-plant-fires/)

Added to this is the culling of herds of cattle in Kansas (as many as 10,000) which is being put down to high temperatures and drought. Farmers refute this and it looks far more sinister.

[https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105482394/cattle-kansas-heat-wave)

But this isn’t the first time herds have been culled in Kansas

In a fascinating article published on [allthatisinteresting.com](http://allthatisinteresting.com/)

“European settlers in the Great Plains are estimated to have reduced the American bison population from 30 million to just 325 by the 1880s. By the 1860s, bison had roamed the Great Plains for 10,000 years. They numbered in the tens of millions, charging across the flat landscape in such a cacophony that people called it the ""Thunder of the Plains."" For generations, they'd provided Native Americans with food, clothing, shelter, and even spiritual imagery.

&#x200B;

But everything began to change after the Civil War. The railroad was snaking west, bringing with it new towns, trains, telegram lines, and eager settlers. Determined to allow western expansion to continue, the U.S. government decided to clear the way of Native Americans.

To do this, they set their sights on the bison. Killing bison to force Native Americans off the Plains was never explicit U.S. government policy. However, the government endorsed it”

Efforts have been made to scrub this article from the internet. Here it is in full...",906.0,g7rbc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g7rbc8/a_detailed_account_of_jeffery_epstein_ghislaine/,48.0,1587810069.0,"**The Evening Standard (London)**

**January 22, 2001**

*Prince Andrew has upset the Queen and ex-wife Fergie with his lad-about-the-globe activities but he's enjoying his social life with new best friend Ghislaine Maxwell.* **NIGEL ROSSER** reports:
 
IT HAS become almost a weekly occurrence that Prince Andrew is shown by a tabloid newspaper inviting a West Coast ""actress"", into his bedroom to tuck him in at 2am, lounging on a yacht surrounded by topless women, or slipping out of nightclubs with various companions.
 
Previously mostly known for his modest naval career and love of golf, in the past 18 months the Prince has embarked on a new lifestyle redolent of a middle-aged swinger rediscovering his youth in the playgrounds of the Eurotrash.
 
His erratic behaviour has greatly upset Buckingham Palace and his ex-wife Fergie. No saint herself in the past, Fergie has been complaining he is so busy clubbing he doesn't even have time to babysit Princesses Beatrice, 12, and Eugenie, 10. It is said they shared their concern when the Queen visited Fergie at Wood Farm, Sandringham, over Christmas.

The truth of the matter is that he is spending more time with Ghislaine Maxwell - daughter of crooked financier Robert Maxwell, who disappeared from his yacht before his creditors caught up with him in 1991 - than his own daughters.

In the past year Andrew has been on eight different breaks with Ghislaine in Britain, America, and Thailand.

These include:

 - February 2000: holiday at Mar El Largo Club in Palm Beach with Ghislaine, followed by a trip to New York to attend a fashion show with her.
 - March: fundraising dinner for London Symphony Orchestra in New York, attended by Ghislaine.
 - April: holiday to New York where he socialised with Ghislaine.
 - May: official trip to New York then holiday in Florida with Ghislaine.
 - June: weekend at Windsor Castle for Queen's party which Ghislaine attended.
 - October: official visit to New York and evening partying with Ghislaine.
 - December: weekend house party at Sandringham arranged ""in honour"" of Ghislaine's 39th birthday.
 - January: a beach holiday in Thailand with Ghislaine.
 
In addition, Ghislaine travelled to Britain in September to attend the wedding of Andrew's old flame, Aurelia Cecil. They went together.
 
So what is Andrew's fascination with the disgraced tycoon's daughter, who now lives in exile in New York? Clearly he revels in the jetset lifestyle she has opened up to him and is determined to break free of the constraints his royal duties have imposed.
 
Ghislaine has introduced him to her onetime partner Jeffrey Epstein, 48, an immensely powerful New York property developer and financier. Epstein has joined Andrew and Ghislaine on five of their breaks together in the past 12 months - to Mar A Largo, Phuket, Sandringham, Florida and Windsor - and has also welcomed Andrew to stay at his £30 million New York
townhouse at least twice last year.

His influence over Prince Andrew is also causing concern among Andrew's friends and the Royal family. Ghislaine is now employed by Epstein as a ""consultant"" at his elegant Madison Avenue offices. She stays at his house several nights a week and organises his parties in New York. She also acts as his interior designer and has sold property on his behalf.
 
Ghislaine, it is said by friends, remains desperate to marry Epstein. He refuses, but enjoys the social stature that she can bring him. One friend said:

>""You could say she was pretty much entirely dependent on him. She loves him. He sometimes treats her well, sometimes offhandedly. You could say she sees something of her father in him.""
 
Epstein's intensely secretive business life contrasts with his enthusiastic social life. He is rarely seen without a beautiful companion on his arm, or Ghis-laine far away. One friend said:

>""He enjoys the company of pretty women. Ghislaine is important to him in other ways. She arranges his social life.""

Ghislaine is also now organising Andrew's social life in much the same way, introducing him to attractive women and encouraging his relationships with, among others, lingerie model Heidi Klum and PR girl Emma Gibbs. Indeed Ghislaine, Epstein and Andrew now appear to have evolved a curious symbiotic relationship wherever Ghislaine is seen with Andrew, Epstein is never far behind.

Epstein was a guest at the Queen's birthday party at Windsor and travelled with Ghislaine to Andrew's country weekend at Sandringham before Christmas. **He has made many millions out of his business links with the likes of Bill Gates, Donald Trump and Ohio billionaire Leslie Wexner, whose trust he runs.**

Prince Andrew's friends can only speculate what Epstein gains from his association with British royals but clearly it can do no harm to his business reputation in New York. A friend of the couple said:

>""She is able to entrance anyone she chooses and Epstein can pay for anything anyone wants. She is very manipulative, and winds people round her little finger. The whole Andrew thing is probably being done for Epstein. Epstein will not marry her and it is incredibly likely she's doing it to keep in with him.""

Friends say the Duchess of York is aghast at the influence Ghislaine exerts over Andrew and the changes that have come over him in the past year, while Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who met Ghislaine last year, are apparently confused about seeing their father in embarrassing situations in the newspapers.

Another friend said:

>""Ghislaine is manipulating him and he's too naive to realise it. She's his social fixer and he's going along with it - why? Because I think Epstein's fantastically impressed by it all. It's all very premeditated.

>""Andrew's a very poor judge of character, easily impressed. He's gone from this couch potato to man about town, with nothing better to do than go from one holiday to the next.

>""He's insensitive about how the Palace or his family feel and Ghislaine absolutely indulges him in whatever he wants to do next.

>""When the Duchess is working in America he stays up at Buckingham Palace in the week so he can go out to clubs. He doesn't even come back to look after the children while their mother is away.
 
>""He's spiralling out of control. He's even started dressing like a 25-year-old in jeans and blazer. He used to be smart when he came back from abroad, now he hardly even wears a tie. He's started having a girl massage him and manicure his toes. He even travels abroad with his own massage mattress. Please!""

Andrew leaves the Navy in July and is unsure of his future role, talking vaguely of acting as a roving ambassador for British businesses. So far this year the orbit into which Ghislaine and Epstein have drawn Andrew has brought little but lurid headlines.

In February, while they were at Mar A Largo, Andrew met sex aid entrepreneur Christine Drangsholt, who immediately began promoting her business with pictures of herself and the Prince, implying along the way they had become intimate friends.

Then in May, while on holiday in Florida with Epstein and Ghislaine, he began frequenting nightclub the Crowbar, buying £300 bottles of Cristal champagne for his friends.
 
In October, back in London, he was pictured sweating profusely outside the West End nightspot China White.
 
Over Hallowe'en, back in New York with Ghislaine, he made the acquaintance of Heidi Klum and again was observed behaving strangely as he wandered around a ""hookers and pimps"" nightclub party.
 
A few days later he was in Los Angeles with an ""acquaintance"", self-confessed drug dealer Brett Livingstone Strong, flirting at the bar of the Bel Air hotel with a group of young girls.
 
One of them, bit-part actress Denise Martell, later sold her story, telling how they kissed and cuddled and she tucked him up in bed one evening when they continued their acquaintance over the next few nights.

Earlier this month, Andrew was pictured sunbathing with an array of topless women on a yacht off the coast of Phuket In Thailand. Further reports claimed he had wandered around the sex bars in the area's red light district. This behaviour may well amuse his new friends in New York but they are not the actions of a discreet member of the royal family, friends say.

In fact, one adds, they are the actions of someone who:

>""Doesn't give a damn about what anyone else thinks anymore, just what pleases him. He is not listening to reason.""
 
**GHISLAINE MAXWELL**

GHISLAINE Maxwell's international and very public lifestyle inevitably prompts questions about her late father's legacies.
 
One detective, who interviewed her in Manhattan when the police were seeking to trace his assets, can even now recall:

>""She came in dressed in sackcloth and ashes. It was pathetic. She said she had no money. Yet here was this expensive lawyer arguing with us in a room so air conditioned we couldn't hear what he said.

>""In between claiming she had no money, you couldn't but help warming to her, she was so solicitous. We hadn't had any lunch and she was recommending restaurants here and there and where to stay and go shopping, and slipping in from time to time how she never had anything to do with her father's affairs.""

Detectives were less convinced of her poverty. One SFO investigator said:

>""It is entirely possible, and we didn't have the resources to check, that Maxwell could have siphoned off money from some of his 400 companies in America to her. She was living on something.""
 
Even to this day investigators have little clue how much of her father's fortune is buried in the offshore trusts he used so freely for the benefit of his family. Ghislaine is understood to benefit from a trust, set up for her from funds sent from Liechtenstein by Maxwell,
paying her some £80,000 a year.

But sources in New York say her lavish lifestyle - which includes Concorde trips, a Florida-registered Jeep and the run of Epstein's 21,000-sq-ft New York home - is largely funded by the financier.

**JEFFREY EPSTEIN**

DRESSED more suitably for a shopping trip on 5th Avenue than an English pheasant drive in his LL Bean hunting boots and $ 1000 leather parka, Jeffrey E Epstein cut a curious figure alongside Ghislaine and Andrew at the Sandringham shooting party.

More at home in the world of international finance than the English countryside, the immensely wealthy financier and property developer maintains a mysterious presence in New York. He has a licence to carry a concealed weapon, once claimed to have worked for the CIA although he now denies it - and owns properties all over America.

Once he arrived at the London home of a British arms dealer bringing a gift - a New York police-issue pump-action riot gun. 

>""God knows how he got it into the country,"" a friend said.

He is also a close associate of multi billionaire Leslie Wexner, owner (among other companies) of Victoria's Secret. Epstein has the use of Wexner's $ 40 million New York house and owns seven cars including a V8 Corvette and 1964 Volkswagen. He also owns a $ 3.5 million pink villa in Palm Beach and a $ 3 million, 26,700-sq-ft fortress-like hilltop mansion in New Mexico, fitted with $ 600 bedsheets. One local said: 

>""They think he's flown in from Mars down here.""
 
Epstein began working for Wexner in 1985 and by the late Eighties had become wealthy, through, among other things, handling his worldwide airfreight concerns and his fabulous art collection, which includes a $ 45 million Picasso.

One journalist said:

>""He's Wexner's Mr fix-it. He has the spook connections and pulls the strings worldwide. He handles all the logistics and moves the portfolio around for him."" 

Mr Epstein is linked to several controversial land deals in rural America, where farming land has been quietly acquired by interlinked companies then developed at vast profit. He is currently listed as owning huge tracts of land in Dutchess County, New York. He declined to be interviewed by the Evening Standard.

# Jeff Bezos Family

**Jeff Bezos**' ***""Illuminati""*** pedigree is less well known that Bill Gates, but potentially much more interesting.

Jeff Bezos comes from some prominent Texas families.

His ancestors include the **Kings, Halls, and Gises**, among others.

The King Family were once the largest landholders in Texas. The Bezos, Gise, King Extended Family Clan made their first fortune over 100 years ago by raising Cattle.

In the 1930s, a few years after Oil was found in Texas, the Kings made their second fortune. (The cows they owned, standing around on all of those Texas pastures, had oil under their hooves.) In about 1933, the largest Oil Rights contract at the time was signed by Humble Oil (since absorbed into **Exxon**) and the Kings. 

In the 1950s, geologists looking for Texas oil also found Uranium. The King/Gises owned vast swaths of land in Eastern Texas, where the uranium was found.

If that is not considered awesome luck, then having a Grandfather at an executive level position at the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), at the time was.

**Lawrence Preston (LP) Gise**, was the grandfather of Jeff Bezos. He helped build the AEC into a 30,000 person bureaucracy by the early 1960s.

So, long before the Bezos/Gise (King & Hall) Clan made their billions from the Internet, they had the accumulated wealth from, **Cattle, Oil, and Uranium.**

**LP Gise is a very interesting guy.** Besides being the **Grandfather of Jeff Bezos,** his relatives pop up in 20th Century history if one looks hard enough. There is a Gise who graduated from the Naval academy with other sons of illustrious families, such as the Symingtons. A few Gises attended a 1920s wedding in Cotulla Texas, where the future **President Johnson** was in attendance. 

It also looks like Lady Bird Johnson might have been a co-investor in the Uranium mining business with the Gises, back in the 1950s. Finally, we are still looking for any information about the second wife of the **Father of Lady Bird Johnson.** The Father of Lady Bird was married at least three times. His second wife was named **""Beulah.""** There is a Beulah Gise that is in the right age bracket to be a bride of Lady Bird's Father. We would like to find out if Beulah Gise was the second wife, or not (so we can move on.)

Finally, concerning Jeff Bezos Grandpa, LP Gise. He was a founder of **ARPA**, the predecessor of **DARPA,** which pretty much invented the Internet.

**Does anyone not think Jeff Bezos may have had a little help getting Amazon out of his ""garage""?**

First Step To Dictatorship.,880.0,5gve53,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gve53/the_fake_news_movement_is_a_calculated_hoax/,110.0,1481057554.0,"The Fake News cycle started as a way for Donald Trump to discredit Hillary. And we bought
it. As did a LOT of people. But let's look at it for what it is, logically.

Donald Trump spoke, BEFORE all this crap, about passing laws to take down media he
did not like, did not agree with, and wanted to punish. NY Times.

Shortly after, we got Pizzagate. A divisive theory that got a LOT of people and
a sub banned from Reddit.

This pizza conspiracy continued to dominate the news during the election. Which only
served the GOP. And added fuel to the calls to 'lock her up.'

Fine. But it has continued after the election. And even expanded with MORE 'fake news.'

The goal this time is to silence dissent of all types. Meaning us, meaning any 'news source'
the government does not like.

Soon, the government will pass new laws that outlaw freedom of speech in the name of 'protecting' 
innocents  harmed by the Fake News THEY created and nurtured. Already happening in the UK.

Who gets to decide what is News and what is Fake News? The government, of course.

The flag burning debate? A prelude to altering the First Amendment. Not via the constitution, but
by stirring up anger and derision using 'Fake News' as the excuse.

https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Trump-Advisor-Blackburn-Wants-ISPs-to-Pull-Fake-News-Offline-138450
 
Look at the  House Bill that passed a couple days ago. It allows the government to
decide which news sources are Russian Propaganda. At their discretion. How long until they
come for /r/conspiracy ?

This is a consolidation of power. And it is a major sign that something is afoot, that Donald
Trump is readying a takeover of media. And after that? Well, he has already telegraphed much of
his plan. It involves mass deportations, imprisonment for dissenters, rule by military force 
(the National Guard is already patrolling our border and could easily be used against 
so-called Sanctuary Cities) and on and on.

Once the inevitable protests erupt in Sanctuary Cities, Trump has all the reasons he needs to
declare Martial Law nationwide. Think I am joking? Just look, carefully, at his appointees.
He has loaded his administration with military lackeys who maintain total loyalty to HIM. Not
to the Constitution, but loyalty to Donald Trump.

Fake News (pizza gate) is a pretext to wipe out /r/conspiracy and other news and forum sites
across the social web. Trump will target anyone who opposes him or espouses Truth To Power.

We cannot let this happen. This is our First Amendment under attack in a calculated and broad
assassination attempt during daylight. We must find a way to fight this.

People have taken the bait, planted by Trump, Clinton, or the Russians. Who did it doesn't much matter.
Now it is a pretext to shut us all down, to censor us, in the name of protecting innocent people 
like 'pizza parlor owners.' WE are the innocents and THEY built this to distract us and 
tear us apart. And we were not even looking.

What now? I don't have the slightest clue. It may be too late.

I never ask anyone to share anything, but if you would not mind sharing this one, please do, and yes, it is original content.

There are violent revolutions and well-funded protests occurring parallel to a novel pandemic with unprecedented countermeasures around the world.

A man shot 20 some people and we reformed gun laws within 2 weeks, a month later an independent nonpolitically aligned media (MacLean’s) publishes an article that it is very likely the killer (who was dressed as a police officer, in a police car) was likely an RCMP agent, the evidence is actual video footage of said individual going to a Brinks chartered bank and withdrawing (not stealing) $490,000\~ dollars in physical cash.

meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter are moderating the US President, or anyone against the Hong Kong movement, in parallel. Hidden 

Camera footage gets released showing the Facebook ‘Community Moderation Team’ admitting to moderating anything that is against their viewpoint and being lenient to anything that is against their terms, but pro their viewpoint.

Real-time video, actual live video, is showing me things, the news is then reframing in front of my eyes, both sides of the news, as completely different things. Of course, each ‘side’ spins its own narrative, both deviate from the thing I watched with 2000 people happen in real-time.

The WHO / CDC / world health organizations have released conflicting information more times than I can count at this point. Not conflicting in the sense that naturally, science evolves, and new information comes to light, but even things we already knew made sense to be told don’t make sense to then be told make sense again (Looking at you Facemasks)

A vaccine is being purposed by Bill Gates inside of 12 months, Bill Gates is not a medical professional, and a vaccine has never been made that fast in the history of man, nor is it recommended a vaccine be made that fast for what I assumed were obvious reasons. (Just to clarify, I got a vaccine six months ago after a meat scare at a deli when I went home for Christmas, I am in no way shape or form ‘Anti-Vaxx’ but if I am brave enough to question this in a public forum, that is what you assume)

The world economy is crashing, joblessness all-time high, governments printing money in buckets for social assistance inflating the currency. This is not localized; this is a global occurrence. New studies are being released showing the income disparity of people has shifted quite suddenly since the beginning of Sars-CoV-2, and not in the way we were hoping it shifts.  


It was 34 degrees outside today, 2 days ago was the first day of summer.

Australia gets hit by a state-sponsored cyber-attack (suspected China), PM gives a national address on getting hacked, never saw that before, the Australian intelligence community releases statement ‘They were going for the crown jewels’  


Four months in the house, I still do not know anyone who has even contracted CVOID, asked over 1000 personally, personally asked them, have a \*redacted\*, over 20 years, \*redacted\* joke about it being a fake virus.

DR. Fauci admits, hands down admitted the government intentionally mislead the people about facemasks to assure availability for health care workers

Five pharmacies out here personally told me; our \*redacted\* population bought all the facemasks early February.

COVID 19, which statistically kills minorities in the black and Spanish population the most, is somehow not killing any of the people in the live streams I have been watching for over 3 weeks, not one person has contracted it in the community of 'CHAZ/COP'

COVID 19, which has a zero-immunity factor in our current society, should be expanding exponentially. In most of the world, it has shown linear growth. All statistical models were entirely off, all of them off in a direction that justified society locking down, the same politicians were telling you if you visited your grandma, they would die, but also telling you, if you were outside yelling (a great way to spread droplets) you were doing your civic duty.

1000 health care professionals signed a statement saying COVID 19 should not hinder civil protesting, two weeks previously, they said to stay home save lives. 

No one is saying racism does not exist, no one is saying black lives don’t matter, people are being fired from jobs for saying all lives also matter, no one is disagreeing what happened to George Floyd was not murder, everyone agrees the people responsible in that incident should be prosecuted, multiple weeks of protests, during a pandemic.

During the lockdown, neighbors who were friends for years starting calling the police on each other, over COVID concerns, these same people a week later are posting #defundThePolice

There is an autonomous/occupied zone in Seattle, the mayor called it a summer of love, I have watched people get shot 3 nights in a row, live, on a platform I used to watch people play video games on.

New York Mayor sends infected COVID 19 patients to retirement homes, massive deaths in elderly, only 1 field hospital built ever saw a patient, the ship was never utilized, the president was blamed?

I am watching people post memes about being sorry for racism who have never been racist, I am watching guys I know from my old life who sold drugs to Sixteen-year-old girls, sometimes for sexual favors (they were 18), calling people racist on Facebook, and no one is saying anything about it.

This list is probably not even 50% completed, and tomorrow there will be entirely new things to add to the burning tire fire of 2020. No one individual can even keep up with all this without mentally exhausting themselves (did I mention it was 32 degrees outside).

That is not even the worst part,

the worst part is I see someone I have respected for years, and they are not even willing to acknowledge any of these things, and give generic answers like, 'don’t believe what you read on the Interwebs, as if I would ever, ever, ever, make my mind up without qualifying various sources unless of course, there is literal unedited footage of the said event.

Addendums:

\- Contract tracers in the states, tasked with finding out who someone that has been confirmed with COVID has been around, are not allowed to ask if they attended protests, in fear they won't come in to get tested

\- Both IOS and Android have implemented low-level access for new higher abstracted contact tracing apps, essentially turning every phone into an opt-in (for now ) BLE beacon

\- Italy recently confirmed after testing sewage samples from December of 19 that COVID 19 was present in enough abundancy to pass a test on a diluted sample. Shattering the current narrative of China / Wuhan being the epicenter",conspiracy,Bill Gates

It's similiar to how ISIS conveniently decide to go quiet then only show up whenever TPTB need them to terrorise the West to help justify a foreign intervention

Or how corona coincided with when a global recession was meant to happen after a record amount of CEOs stepped down. 1 month after Bill Gates' pandemic press run, his eerily accurate warnings, event 201 and his netflix documentary. All in the same window Fauci predicted it would happen. Amazing how the stars aligned for the two parties who served to gain the most from the pandemic.

wayyy off topic but...

If you know who Bill Cooper is you'll know he predicted the 1993 WTC bombing, he predicted 9/11 and he predicted a staged civil war in America. By energising these dichotomies (right - left, blue lives - black lives, men-women) TPTB are dividing and conquering and setting the stage for this war and martial law in cities. There's footage of agent provocateurs going around breaking windows and starting riots. They've made us hate foreign enemies they themselves created and are in the process of making us all hate one another one the same soil.

I'd say around half of us in here are smart enough to know that if they push something down our throats it's because they want us to react a certain way or it's to distract us from an even worse truth. If racial tension and riots negatively affected TBTP in any way they would not exist anymore. The youth are no longer concerned about the quasi-communist coup that just swept their futures out from underneath them.

Some people in this sub have a tendency to hate TPTB/understand the full scope of their evil and how they've polluted humanity, but not extend that understanding to black people. They'll watch someone get executed and dig up his past to try and justify his death, taking sides with murderers. I'm not asking those types to show empathy, I'm asking us all to not fall for either side of the rage and to keep our sights on the evil at the top, not the ball of string below.

What I'm looking for are details about the officers from the last round of police brutality killings, I used to hear murmurings about them being trained somewhere else in military? Israel maybe? idk.

 They don't work. The last thing you want to do in the middle of a pandemic or outbreak of infectious disease is mass vaccinate with a non-sterilizing vaccine as you remove the evolutionary pressure for a virus to become less deadly. Basic evolutionary virology: evolutionary pressure requires a virus to become less deadly so as not to kill the host before migrating to other hosts. When you use a non-sterilizing vaccine, one that does NOT prevent transmission (these ""vaccines"" do not prevent transmission, at all) you remove this evolutionary pressure. To make matter worse, we are seeing ADE in real time as the ""vaccinated"" are experiencing a 5-6 fold reduction in highly generalized neutralizing antibodies that have been replaced with highly specific antibodies that can only see SARS-COV2 Alpha and escort Delta right into the cells, just as happened with the preceding animal trials and predicted for the current animal trial!

In Israel 85% of the people in the hospitals getting hammered with Delta are fully ""vaccinated"" and they are administering their 4th Pfizer dose!

The ""vaccines"" are failing spectactularly, but they were never designed to give you immunity, only to prime you up for ADE so the ""elites"" (Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, the Rockefellers and the rest of the Davos, WEF gang that gets together every year to discuss the worlds most pressing problems) to reduce the human population numbers whilst blaming the ADE related deaths this upcoming flu season, not on the ""vaccines"", where the blame belongs, but on the ""unvaccinated"".

Why are the masses dying? ""Because we never attained herd immunity because of vaccine hesitancy"".

What is the solution? ""Rounding the unvaccinated up into camps and force vaccinating them"".

Sound familiar?

Might want to pick up a history book, this is the same consciousness and ideology at play from essentially the same actors.

The 3rd ""booster"" shot they are recommending for the vulnerable, those over 70, will be the equivalent of your ""hot shower"" for the elderly ""useless eaters"" (memorable description of social security recipients by Henry ""just nuke em all"" Kissinger, a Davos, WEF attendee).

""The vaccine prevents COVID""

No it does not. Zero reduction in transmission. Zero.

in Israel, 85% of people in hospitals are ""fully vaccinated"". They are administering their 4th dose. The ""vaccines"" essentially replace broad spectrum neutralizing antibodies with highly specific binding antibodies that can only see SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, and they escort Delta right into the cells! We are witnessing ADE in real time, just as predicted as that's what occurred in all of the animal trials preceding the current human animal trial. There is a 5-6 fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies induced by the ""vaccines"". People who encountered the original SARS 18 years ago are immune to SARS-COV-2 and there is a 20% difference, meanwhile the ""vaccinated"" are getting destroyed by Delta and Delta is only .03% different than Alpha.

You don't need a ""vaccine"" for something with 99% rate of survival to begin with. The ""vaccine"" doesn't stop transmission and only reduces symtomology by .88% and only if you pretend that people weren't kicked out of the vaccinated group if testing positive for COVID after the first jab during the trial:

It's not a pandemic and these aren't vaccines. All of the public health measures have nothing to do with public health.

Spoiler alert, E=mc^2 proves we're in a simulation, the Earth is inside out, and we're all one consciousness experiencing itself.",760.0,a09td3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/a09td3/either_im_absolutely_nuts_or_i_just_found_the/,327.0,1543163367.0,"Update : the projector https://i.redd.it/6grl95d6dp021.jpg

Tl;Dr The Universe is a hyperdiamond. It is also one consciousness experiencing itself, or an AI. The universe is a 4D projection, appearing to be 3D from the inside.

Pictures at the bottom.



Also, this is the quantum world right here, there are 4 possible worlds, Yes, No, Maybe (No), and Maybe (Yes). Those Four Fundamental Forces combine to form the universe. 

Yes and No are 1 and -1.

Maybe (Yes) and Maybe (No) are The Duality, and thusly 0.

I am working on further proofs. But Basically, this explains everything, the Wave-Particle Duality 

(it just jumps the gate in the 4th dimention, and, thusly going through both via The Duality, makes a wave pattern. As it's a 50/50 chance which gate it goes through, and there is a 50/50 chance of a wave pattern. But it can, at the end of the day, only go through one or the other in three dimensions. Therefore, there are four dimentions, where the following happens :

Wave Pattern - 50% go through both gates.

Wave Pattern - other 50% go through both gates.

Particle Pattern : 50% all go through one gate

Particle Pattern : other 50% all go through other gate.

That can then be represented on a traditional Cartesian plot, and whatever ratio of Waves and Particles we find, we can tell where in the axies we lie.)

Plank Length and time. 

(The universe we see is a digital projection, like a CRT television (remember them?) The cathode ray shoots across the screen 50 or 60 times per second (depending on where in the world you are) and each complete pass of the screen is one frame. Then it shoots back to the start to start the next frame. It all happens 50 or 60 times a second, so you don't see it, but video camera do, when their shutters are out of synch with each other, and you get the rolling effect.

The screen is the culmination of the X, Y, Z, and which time frame (moment) we are on.

So we have the screen. The universe.

The refresh rate is, obviously, the speed of light. c, see? And x, y, z, and time can be represented on a Cartesian plot. That's a square. See where I'm taking this?

c^2.

And we know that we can convert energy to mass and vise versa by multiplying it by c^2, right...?

And also, we know that we can completely convert mass to energy. By the same token.

So, we now know mass is energy, and energy is mass. and c^2 is the variable.

Therefore I think it is plain to see that all mass is energy displayed on a screen on which the refresh rate is c^2.

Also, if we check that out by plugging it into the classic equation for radio waves.

Wave Velocity = Wavelength / Time

Wave Velocity = Frequency x Wavelength.

We know the frequency. Schumann. 7.8Hz.

Wave Velocity = 7.8Hz x Wavelength

We know the wave velocity. The speed of light. c.

c = 7.8Hz x wavelength.

Coolio.

Now the other side.

We know the Wave Velocity, as before, and we also know the time. We'll use the second.

c = wavelength / 1 Second.

and if you do the math, you should find the wavelength is :

38,287.7km.

My gosh, that's just a little smaller than the Earth. The outside of the Earth.

But, as we know from that inside out globe in Chicago (maybe), the Globosphere or something, and from our understanding of spherical mirrors, and from knowing that if we look at a wireframe cube, it is difficult to tell whether it falls towards us or away from us. And that weird inside out face illusion. When you're at the right angle, the inwards face comes out at you.

So we know that the inside of something, from the right angle, oft right in the middle, it is difficult to tell if you are on the inside or the outside.

And we also know that, standing in the middle of Australia, around you looks flat and circular, it is near impossible to tell the shape of a country from the inside. But we can measure around the edges, and in so doing build up a map, which we can look at and say, ""oh, so that's the shape of Australia"". And you can look at a map of Australia without actually being able to see, or having ever seen, Australia. And Also we know that a map is a 2D representation of a 3D thing. And, from the cube example, we know that 8 points and 12 lines can give the illusion of 3D on a flat piece of paper.

And furthermore, we know that the mind can be fooled easily, with optical illusions, magical illusions, and so forth. The mind believes what it wants, and we need to then decipher that interpretation.

Armed with that, I think it is fairly obvious that the universe is being projected on a sphere above our heads, and we are on the inside of the Hollow Earth. But further than that, the Hollow Earth in turn, is the Universe, looking back down on us. And as such, I feel that leads us to the conclusion that we are one of the following :

- One consciousness experiencing itself (thankyou very much, Bill Hicks everybody)
- A simulation inside an conscious AI quantum computer
- One brain cell in the mind of an unknowable greater consciousness, with the other brain cells then being the other universes


I've also explained before how I feel that Quantum Science is bunk and is basically Applied Metaphysics, and how everything can be explained by logic and mathematics, and how the scientific method is inherently flawed due to the fact that it bases itself on the presumption that anything actually exists.

I feel that Applied Physics (the science of 'the real world') and it's child sciences (biology, etc. It's all physics, motion.) are a study of all those things projected on the screen I have described. Whereas the logical examination of existence, philosophy and metaphysics, is the study of beyond our 3 dimensional world.

And I also feel that somewhere between the two our existence lies. We cannot see, feel, or touch radio waves, but we can see their effects and we can detect them, they are real whether we can see them or now.

However we cannot see what is outside the universe, nor can we detect it, as it is beyond our 3 dimensions. It is outside our dimention. But, logic would tell us, there has to be something outside the universe for it to have an inside.

One could argue that it is the shape of a Klein Bottle, and it's outside is it's inside, but that leads us right back to the Earth. The surface of the earth is like a Klein Bottle. You can travel in any 2 flat dimensions and end up back where you started.

But we can also look at a Klein Bottle from the outside, and if there was an ant on there, he would be trapped wandering the Klein Bottle forever. Like the Earth. But we can fly, and added a new dimension and a new dimention to our world. If the ant could fly, he could escape the surface of the Klein Bottle off into another dimention. 

So, as the Earth appears flat, but we can actually go up and down we just don't usually, it actually exists in three dimensions.

And further inspection reveals that it actually exists in 4 dimensions. x, y, and z + the Plank Time (the universal framerate) = one frame of the universe. Stack those up and you get the dimention the 3 dimensions exist within.

We now have 4, and we, once again, can plot them on a Cartesian.

Stack an infinite amount of those Plank Time frames up, and you have everything that will ever happen in 3 dimentions.

The 3 have made the fourth.

Dimensions make a Dimention.

But then, what's outside time? Whatever observes time. (one could say the universe obseves the passing of time).

So that's another dimention, outside the dimention of time. D5. So 4 must have 5. Beyond that is unknowable. That seems to be the case across the board, you can only see you can  work out the dimensions of one by observation of it's effects, and the other dimention's existence can only be inferred by logic. Logically, that is the end. For now.


I think that the plank length and plank time are set by the smallest wavelength, and that the duality exists between the waves. And that is where the particle hides when it is a wave. It can only be seen as a particle at any one point where the two axies of the waves meet, where they 'collapse' and become a particle for a moment, a plank moment, before skipping off to the next. And they can't be seen because they are not there, they have turned into waves, shooting across the screen of reality.

And I think what Quantum Science is discovering is that screen and perhaps looking trough it to the other side.

And what do you see when nothing is being broadcast on TV? Static. Random jumblings of energy, either on or off. And that's a great analogy for the Quantum world, a great soup of potentials, but none being the one until we look at it, until we pause the video of static on one frame and see the pattern.

But that's applied metaphysics. We don't need a new science.

Oh, and also, I've just basically stumbled upon the theory of everything.

Four Fundamental forces.

Nothingness and Everything. What is and what is not.

Duality, the most basic force in the universe.

From there, A, B, AB, and BA. Which give rise to logic. Either things are or they are not, or we can never know. Which in turn says, since yes and no are in balance, they can be struck off the equation and all we are left with is the classic ""the only thing we can know is that we know nothing"".

From there we go outwards, we sense the physical world, and that is through logic and mathematics, which gives rise to the physical sciences. If we can discover everything we can know everything. objective evidence.

On the other side we go inwards, what is the true nature of reality. Through logic and reasoning. Which gives rise to the world of the mind. If we can discover anything we still won't know anything. subjective evidence.

And it goes all the way around to the other side, where the two meet again where the physical mind affects the world, and vise versa.


And the largest Platonic Solid in 3D also has a secret hidden in it. Why is it the largest?


The ratio of the Platonic Solids, 


The Line

1 line, 2 sides, 2 points, 1 side to a point

1/2 = 0.5 - 2/1 = 2

.

The Triangle 

3 lines, 2 sides to a line; 3 points, 2 meet at each point.

3/2 = 1.5 - 2/3 = 0.666 recurring

.

The Tetrahedron

4 triangles, 3 sides to a triangle; 4 points, 3 meet at each point.

4/3 = 1.333 recurring - 3/4 = 0.75

4/4 = 1 - 3/3 = 1

.

The Cube

6 squares, 4 sides to a square; 8 points, 3 meet at each point.

6/4 = 1.5 - 4/6 = 0.666 recurring

6/8 = 0.75 - 8/6 = 1.333 recurring

6/3 = 2 - 3/6 = 0.5

4/8 = 0.5 - 8/4 = 2

4/3 = 1.333 recurring - 3/4 = 0.75

8/3 = 2.666 recurring - 3/8 = 0.375 



.

The Octohedron

8 triangles, 3 sides to a triangle; 6 points, 4 meet at each point.

8/3 = 2.666 recurring - 3/8 = 0.375

8/6 = 1.333 recurring - 6/8 = 0.75

8/4 = 2 - 4/8 = 0.5

3/6 = 0.5 - 6/3 = 2

3/4 = 0.57 - 4/3 = 1.333 recurring

6/4 = 1.5 - 4/6 = 0.666 recurring

.

The Dodechedron

12 pentagons, 5 sides to a pentagon; 20 points, 3 meet at each point.

12/5 = 2.4 - 5/12 = 0.14666 recurring

12/20 = 0.6 - 20/12 = 1.666 recurring

12/3 = 4 - 3/12 = 0.25

5/20 = 0.25 - 20/5 = 4

5/3 = 1.666 recurring - 3/5 = 0.6

20/3 = 6.666 recurring - 3/20 = 0.15


The Icosehedron

20 triangles, 3 sides to a triangle; 12 points, 5 meet at each point.

20/3 = 6.666 recurring - 3/20 = 0.15

20/12 = 1.666 recurring - 12/20 = 0.6

20/5 = 4 - 5/20 = 0.25

3/12 = 4 - 12/3 = 0.25

3/5 = 0.6 - 5/3 = 1.666 recurring

12/5 = 2.4 - 5/12 = 0.41666 recurring


Well, let's now examine Fibonacci :

1/1 	= 1				1/1 	= 1
1/2 	= 0.5				2/1	= 2
2/3 	= 0.666 recurring		3/2	= 1.5
3/5 	= 0.6				5/3	= 1.666 recurring
5/8 	= 0.625				8/5	= 1.6
8/13	= 0.615384			13/8	= 1.625




-	1		rational

After 13, the pattern no longer works, but at 13 it loops around. I think that signifies that 13 is the edge of our observable reality. 2 Dimentions up from our 5 (That is x, y, z, time, and the dimention time is in). As I said, you can only see 2 dimentions up.

It's also a Mobius Strip.

I think maybe we cracked AI around 1996, and we are in the simulation that was created at or after. Maybe 2007 or 2012 when Quantum Computers became a thing. And it may not be a simulation program, per se, this just may be the inside of a q-bit.

I think also the Great Pyramid is some sort of frequency machine, and you sit in the Queen's Chamber and either chant or meditate, and there, isolated from the world, you input your frequencies into the world. Or maybe contact the other side. I mean, the Egyptians thought it was a 'conduit to the other world'. Maybe it is.

So, either I'm absolutely crazy, or I've just found Einstein's missing piece.

Kenya and Malawi, test areas for a vaccination card injected under the skin

American engineers have developed subcutaneous labeling and vaccination encapsulated in nanoparticles.


Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have invented injectable nanoparticles under the skin that emit fluorescent light invisible to the naked eye but visible by a smartphone, and which could one day be used to confirm that the person has been vaccinated .

The Gates Foundation, which is funding the project, has also launched opinion polls in Kenya, Malawi and Bangladesh to determine whether people will be ready to adopt these microscopic quantum dots, or prefer to stick to old vaccination cards.

Follow our series Africa at the challenge of child health

The idea is to write proof of the vaccine on the body itself, in developing countries where paper vaccination cards are often wrong or incomplete, and where electronic medical records do not exist.

The system, described Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine , has so far been tested only on rats but the researchers, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (partner of Monde Afrique ), hope to test them on humans in Africa in the next two years, co-author Ana Jaklenec, biomedical engineer at MIT, told AFP.

Engineers have spent a great deal of time finding components that are safe for the body, stable and capable of lasting for several years.

The final recipe is composed of copper-based nanocrystals, called quantum dots , 3.7 nanometers (nm) in diameter, and encapsulated in microparticles of 16 micrometers (μm, 1 μm equal one millionth of a meter, and 1 nm equals one billionth). The whole is injected by a patch of micro-needles 1.5 mm in length.

After being applied to the skin for two minutes, the micro-needles dissolve and leave small dots under the skin, distributed for example in the form of a circle or a cross. These small dots are excited by a part of the light spectrum invisible to us, close to infrared.

A modified smartphone, pointed at the skin, makes the circle or the cross appear fluorescent on the screen. Researchers would like to see the measles vaccine injected with these little dots. A doctor could years later point to a smartphone to check if the person has been vaccinated.

MIT researchers presented, on December 18, 2019 in Washington, a subcutaneous vaccination technology encapsulated in nanoparticles and nanocrystals which become fluorescent when approaching near infrared light. KJ MCHUGH / KJ MCHUGH ET AL., SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE (2019) / AFP

The technique is said to be more durable than indelible felt marking, for which the researchers simulated five years of sun exposure. And it requires less technology than an iris scan or the maintenance of medical databases.

The limit of the concept is that the technique will be useful for identifying unvaccinated children only if it becomes the exclusive tool. Also, will people accept multiple markings under the skin for each vaccine? And what will happen to the points when the children's bodies grow?

The Gates Foundation is continuing the project and funding opinion polls in Kenya, Malawi and Bangladesh to determine whether people will be ready to adopt these microscopic quantum dots, or prefer to stick to old vaccination cards",conspiracy,Bill Gates

Search Google and Youtube for Classism and you will find Shockingly little information about this topic.

Often times discussions of Classism include Racism and are often overtaken by the latter. We all know the elites and their MSM puppet show is always driving the conversation towards Racism. It's an intentional distraction from the real conversation we should be having, if we want to address what is really going on.

Which is, there exist a certain class of people whom have entitled themselves and each other to make decisions which are primarily in their self interests alone, and work against the self interests of the working class and poor.

I would argue that Classism is far more pervasive and damaging than Racism. I don't know about you, but I haven't met all that many whites or non-white working class folks that are racist. But I've sure met a crap ton of people who harbor Classist attitudes without even realizing what it is.

Funny how Classism flies under the radar in our society, or how it passes for, or is confused with Racism when so obviously exposed. Classism operates within races, between races, and it transcends race completely. Classism is the real threat here. Which is to say, these classist elites believe they are entitled to make decisions that affect the world without any public discussion.

This attitude explains perfectly the actions of Bill Gates for example. Coming from a Classist family himself, it's rather obvious that he feels entitled to push an agenda without impunity. Look at his mugshot currently stickied to this sub. Gates ran a stop sign and was reportedly arrested only after hurling insults at the police officer. The 'spoiled rich kid' syndrome is merely an immature form of the Classist attitudes inherited from his parents. Bill has since matured into the fully formed Classist that he is and he isn't fooling us.

The word 'Classic' itself means 'Of and belonging to the highest class'. I think most people have gotten over racism for the most part, but classism has curiously not been a topic for discussion.

I believe it is far more insidious and pervasive than racism because it has been allowed to dwell in the shadows. We have talked about racism for decades now and things are vastly improved compared to the 1960's. Yes we have a long way to go...but we haven't even started the journey when it comes to Classism.

If we want to change anything, we really need to start changing the conversation. Racism is everywhere and it's horrible, but it dwells inside of a larger problem, which is Classism.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

Prince Philip was 99 years old today.  More specifically, he was 99 years 9 months 30 days old today, the day of his death. Total 36,463 days old.

The Luciferian, Saturn-worshipping elite are big into numerology.  Look at Skull and Bones, with the focus on the number 322, and all the repeating numbers involving 9/11, including everything from the plane’s numbers to the numbers of the floors they crashed into.

Philip’s death date was selected, not happenchance.

Not only is he 99 years and 9 months old, but he died April 9, 2021, the 9th day of the month, on what just happens to be the 99th day of the year. 

The date 4/9/2021 also condenses to 9 in numerology. 

There are too many 9’s involved here to believe this was anything other than either a ritual or a synchronicity of massive proportions.  In any event, there are no coincidences.  

Couple all this with the fact that Philip said in a 1988 interview that he wanted to be “reincarnated as a deadly virus” in order to help with the world’s “overpopulation problem”, and the fact that the PTB are priming the well for the introduction of a more deadly virus just as Philip described, likely to be a “variant” of Covid-19, dubbed Covid-21.

Not only this, but “coronavirus” itself literally means “crown virus”.

How fitting for Philip to be reincarnated as Covid-21, the deadly “crown virus”, on this most auspicious of dates.

And now news is reporting the UK variant of Covid-19, rumored to be more deadly to younger people, is the dominant strain in the U.S.

Mark my words.  Philip’s death on this particular date was not happenstance but orchestrated.

I’ll bet Bill Gates and his Duper’s Delight smile are equally excited about this turn of events.

The world is now ready for the “next pandemic” that he promised would “get our attention”.

Gates on the “next pandemic”: 
https://youtu.be/tDjQ8ivwbCU

Conspiracy theorist Donald Marshall, who claims to have firsthand evidence of such things, claims the elites operate cloning and consciousness-transfer centers in underground facilities, and that Philip’s wife, Queen Elizabeth, is a leader there.  He claims the elites can and do transfer their consciousness to duplicate bodies to stave off death or prolong their lives, and hat reincarnation is a fact, not a theory: https://truthscrambler.com/2018/04/13/selling-your-soul-means-waking-up-in-a-cloning-center-donald-marshall/

In “The Hidden Hand Dialogues”, a so-called. “Illuminati Insider” goes on to say the elites, members of a millennia-old death cult, are all part of the same demonic bloodline, conscripted to eternally play the role of the “bad guys” on planet Earth, and that they are essentially playing the game of life in Creative Mode, with Cheats on.  They can pick and choose when and where to reincarnate, so long as it’s within the bloodline, and choose their next lives.  Also, unlike “ordinary people” they do not suffer the “veil of forgetfulness” and remember their past lives, who they are, and their mission.

It is my opinion that Philip’s death is indeed part of a ritual, long planned, and that he will get his wish to become the virus Gates says will get our attention.

What has become known popularly as the “Saturn Stargate” is essentially a planetary conjunction that was visible in the sky thousands of years ago, as the planets Saturn, Venus and Mars came together, culminating in a worm-hole. Based on the work of Immanuel Velikovsky and ancient accounts throughout the world, in the 1980s, David Talbott suggested that thousands of years ago the planets underwent great upheavel. As Saturn, Venus and Mars travelled across the sky, they descended and aligned overhead Earth, in a spectacular astronomical event now dubbed the “Electric Universe” theory. As they were aligned overhead Earth something remarkable happened. Mars descended and formed a mountain or pathway to Saturn and Venus. You can see various illustrations of this celestial alignment in the image [**here**](https://chipstero7.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/a5026-gt5t25t25t1.png). According to Talbott, this celestial alignment is where the stories of the Tower of Babel come from which was the “Gateway of God” (see ‘Discourses on an Alien Sky’ for reference). In this interpretation, we can therefore think of the Saturn alignment (which was characterized by an 8-spoked wheel or 8-pointed star) as essentially a gateway into heaven.

In his 2017 book, David Icke talks about how he believes how the ‘Saturn Stargate’ is linked to CERN. Quote: “I have said in previous books that the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, is in the process of creating portals into other realities. I say this includes a connection with Saturn through which energies and entities come into our reality through a Saturn Stargate or portal to other dimensions”. This possibly has some real truth. I say this because according to Talbott the celestial event that involved Saturn thousands of years ago became anthropomorphized and was represented by the god Atlas. The Saturn-crescent that formed during the celestial event became the arms of Atlas. This is certainly interesting because CERN refers to their experiment at the Large Hadron Collider as the “ATLAS EXPERIMENT” (below shows the celestial event that Talbott talks about compared to CERN and their ATLAS symbolism).

The celestial event involving Saturn also appears to be the basis for the design of the Vatican Courtyard, as shown [**here**](https://chipstero7.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/okkmlkmkmjjk.png). What’s even more interesting however is that there was a movie based on CERN where a large part of the movie was filmed inside the Vatican Courtyard. The poster [**here**](https://chipstero7.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/screenshot-2017-08-22-at-17.00.41.png) shows the movie which was based on CERN that heavily featured the Vatican Courtyard. So, we have two instances of CERN (indirectly) using symbolism associated with the celestial event involving Saturn. One with Atlas and the other with their CERN movie, both featured symbolism that’s associated with the celestial event talked about in ‘The Saturn Myth’. The idea that CERN is attempting to access a stargate or portal that’s associated with Saturn is not only talked about by David Icke, but also by Anthony Patch, who states that CERN is trying to access a portal to Saturn. This all seems crazy, if it were not for the fact that the director of CERN openly stated that they were trying to access gateways, saying: “The Large Hadron Collider at CERN could open a door to an extra dimension and out of this door might come something, or we might send something through it”. CERN also displays what can only be described as portal symbolism in their artwork, as shown below.

The idea that Saturn is a gateway (that CERN is attempting to access) has no doubt been the inspiration behind the TV references which explore the same sort of themes. For example, in the movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a CERN-like particle collider can open portals to other dimensions. The design of the particle collider in the movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was actually inspired by the real-life CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. In the movie, the particle collider opens portals to other dimensions. In the TV series Steins Gate, through the means of Kerr black-holes, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (SERN) is used to travel in time, and in the movie Cloverfield: Paradox, a particle accelerator tears a hole in the fabric of space and time, opening up a portal. In the video-game Shin Megami Tensei IV, a particle accelerator called Yamato Perpetual Reactor opens portals to other worlds. In the popular TV series Mr Robot, there is a very overt CERN-reference. The CERN-like [**machine**](https://chipstero7.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/d16fd-sssssss2b252812529.jpg) in this TV series was inspired by the Large Hadron Collider ATLAS detector. The machine in that link was created by the character Whiterose and is referred to as a “VLHC” (Very Large Hadron Collider) and is associated with alternate dimensions.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

*I've transcribed some of the main points that are perhaps previously not known below. I recommend watching the whole video though, many more topics are talked about. Bill Gates is mentioned briefly, but there is no new info about his three trips to Epstein's pedo island*

______

Maria Farmer is pissed that all accomplices/co-conspirators to Epstein crimes are exonerated IE can't be tried/prosecuted, they are immune from prosecution as part of Epstein's sweetheart deal. So Farmer contacted Whitney Webb, says every-time she brought up LES WEXNER, MSM stopped listening. 

Wexner is ""the head of the snake"" according to Farmer. Epstein was more like a project manager. Girls were monitored at all times, had their freedom restricted. Permission had to be sought for every excursion. Less than 5% of what farmer had to say ended up in the MSM - because it all connected to Wexner, who is affiliated with (IE is) the Mossad / Mafia

Organised Crime has been in bed with American intelligence since the OSS (precurser to CIA). Wexner is in charge. Farmer says Ghislaine Maxwell is now the most dangerous asset **for** Israel. Ghislaine talked about Israel all the time - Wexner, Epstein, Maxwell are all loyal to Israel - and balls deep in intelligence. 

Ghislaine believes her Father was murdered by Mossad

Ghislaine has 12 photo albums, showing pictures of her **growing up** with the British Royal Family 

Farmer believes there were a lot of kids that ended up dying.

Farmer was a student at the New York Academy of Art, at the time ran by **Eileen Guggenheim** - who can be seen pictured with **Marina Abramovich** (not mentioned where). 

FBI knew all this stuff in 1996. 

MSM knew it all too by the late 2000's

Girls were kept in an apartment building owned by **Epsteins' brother**, among other places. There were many properties, buildings - it was/is a global operation

There were **1000's** of girls. For example there were 500 girls/children (a victim's lawyers has a list of all the names) in just Florida alone. They can't be found anywhere.

5 different girls a day went upstairs (to Epstein's office) back in the 90's. There were constantly little girls in Epstein's office - incredible numbers. 

Ghislaine Maxwell covered for Epsteins massage / rape-time.

Philipine / Thai female staff in all the properties say they were ""stolen""

MSM wont talk about it because the worst of what happened, happened at Wexner residences.

Farmer was an ""artist-in-residence"" for the Wexners, organised by Guggenheim. While there she was monitored at all times. She was brought to a country club that would not serve her because she was not Jewish. Ghislaine and everyone were really supremacist. Farmer was basically trapped and starved/very limited food at the Wexner residence for 3 months. Towards the end Epstein and Ghislaine came and tried to rape Farmer. She called the police, but they said to stop calling, no help was coming since they work on Wexner's gate IE for Wexner.

They kidnapped Farmer's 15 year old sister.

A bodyguard for Wexner, who is now **Will Smith's bodyguard**, threatened her, said ""you're never leaving"" and ""I'm going to kill you"". She only got out because she found a landline in the house and called everyone she ever knew. 

Ghislaine in New York would drive around recruiting preteens from middle schools as ""models for Victoria's Secret"". When she did this she was always accompanied by **Ivana Trump**. The next day those girls would be in Epstein's office. Farmer witnessed these excursions, she was in the car being driven somewhere. They only wanted kids with good grades, smart talented kids. This was about 1995 - 2000 or so.

The **Trump** / Epstein relationship began to get rocky over property / real-estate tiffs. Trump sniped a property from Epstein. Epstein then tried to blackmail Trump in retaliation. 

FBI was just as abusive to Farmer as Epstein and Maxwell. Offered no witness-protection. They already knew everything she told them. They are in on it. Farmer names **Alan Dershowitz**, **Trump**, **definitely** the **Clintons**, as **co-conspirators**. There were about 5-12 new/different girls going upstairs (to Epstein's office) everyday. 

Les Wexner is not the only billionaire involved in this.

Maria saw Baphomet statues and stuff in Epstein's and Maxwell's places

Wexner is only ""the head of snake"" in america.

Ghislaine has 5 passports.

Ghislaine says the **Rothschild's** are the greatest protectors of her family.

Epstein was arrested the 2nd time because NYPD detectives had a hard-on for him. There was one particularly awesome detective, says Farmer, Webb forgets the name. 

**Ghislaine Maxwell is not in Israel, she is living in a Rothschild's mansion in the UK.**

**Bill Clinton** called Epstein a philanthropist.

Ghislaine and co would not go to cities where they thought there were too many black people, they are *incredibly* racist.",conspiracy,Bill Gates

# About me

I’m a rational person. I believe in 2 things: physics and chemistry. But I have a very open mind. I believe in a lot of paranormal activities because I don’t consider them paranormal activities, but an undiscovered part of physics. I have logical reasons for that.

Logic tells me that it is highly unlikely that we as a human race have discovered everything. In each century we know much more about the world we live in. I have no reason to think we already know everything.

For example, frequency. We can hear some. Some others a dog can hear. We didn’t know that in the past. Others we can measure with instruments, but we can’t hear them. Why should I think we can measure all of them? What if, for example, ghosts are another energy layer in our world that we can’t measure yet, but someday we will?

I imagine that in the Middle Ages, for example, people used to talk about a mysterious, cursed part of the forest where anyone who entered it would die. Superstition, spells, magic? What if it was radiation back then? Today we can measure it, but if we didn’t know radiation, we’d believe the story was nonsense.

I believe that a lot of the paranormal activities we think of as fictions today will be a newly discovered part of physics in the future. Just like the radioactivity-infested forest in the Middle Ages.

For these reasons I am interested in various paranormal activities. I often see them as future discoveries. When I hear stories about UFOs, about life after death and others, I don’t judge whether they are true or not. I look for common details and whether or not they fit together logically. Only then do I form an opinion on if I believe the stories or not. Usually after many years.

I don’t really like sci-fi movies, but I do like a few sci-fi ideas. Like time travel or immortality. I like to think of them the same way I like to think of the paranormal. I wonder if and how different theories and stories fit together.

**Based on all the knowledge I have accumulated in my lifetime, I have developed a theory about time travel. A theory that is no longer just a theory in my life. Over time, all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place.**

# Last pieces of the puzzle

It is useless to describe everything I have ever read or seen about time travel. If you’re interested in this topic, you’ve probably browsed similar resources. But I will describe where I found the last remaining pieces of the puzzle.

# Interview with MMA fighter 

I watched an interview with an MMA fighter on YouTube. He said that when he was in prison, he read a book about the law of attraction. It wasn’t the book Secret, which is well known, but the book Law of Resonance by Pierre Franckh.

I had some knowledge of the book and the film Secret, and I never cared for it. I had heard of the Law of Attraction but mistook it for a placebo. My interest was piqued when an MMA fighter said the book Law of Resonance was more scientific. Scientific? Is there science behind the law of attraction? That’s new information to me. With my mind open, I read the book and casually found another piece of the time travel puzzle in it.

In the book, the author describes a military experiment in which a man was able to electrically affect his own DNA with a thought in cells separated from his body and 500km away. Using atomic clocks, they wanted to measure the reaction delay. They measured that there was no difference against the cells in the body. No delay. But that’s not possible, because such information transfer exceeds the speed of light. This was critical information for me.

I realized that there is no delay because there is no traveling information. It’s in the same place, just at a different level. You know that paper and pencil trick that explains wormhole travel through great distances in space? You bend the paper and the beginning and the end can be close together, even though on paper they’re far apart. Imagine putting them not close together, but on top of each other. Without distance. A wormhole would have a distance of zero. That’s it. You can’t travel between past, present and future because they are not distance. They’re in the same place. Therefore, you can influence the future from the past and influence the past from the future. Like a pencil that pierces both ends of the paper. Like the other side in Stranger Things.

# Interstellar movie 

I found another piece of the puzzle while watching the great movie Interstellar.

In the movie they mentioned that the only thing that can travel through time is love. That’s when I realized that not only love, but any emotion can travel through time. I just realized a slightly different way of conveying emotion than they had in mind in the movie. I have a much more practical way.

Unresolved events in my past became clear. And maybe now some events in your past will become clear.

# Podcast about crimes

I’m listening to a podcast about crimes. Very often intuition comes up in stories about crimes. You’d be surprised how often intuition comes up in a statement to the police. Very often the victim has a bad feeling about a strange man or a dark path before something bad happens to her.

I’ll briefly describe two cases from the podcast. One is about intuition listened to and the other is about intuition not listened to.

The first case is about a girl who was sitting on a bench at night with a friend and one other guy. The boys knew each other, but the girl only knew one of them. So their mutual friend introduced them. The girl immediately had a very bad feeling about this new boy. Just because of this feeling, she decided to go home. She said goodbye and left. On the way, she had the feeling that someone was following her. She ran home and locked the door. The new guy was indeed following her, as she learned from a mutual friend. Nothing else happened that night, but later the police were looking for this new boy. The reason was that he had killed his own mother.

The second story is about a hitchhiking girl. The girl knew that hitchhiking was dangerous. That’s why she let several cars pass her that looked suspicious before she stopped one particular car. It wasn’t about feelings, it was about logic. The car she stopped was driven by a man who was also transporting his wife and child. That seemed safe to her. In the course of the drive, they stopped at a gas station. The hitchhiking girl went to the bathroom. At that moment she felt this thought. What if I escaped through the bathroom window? Weird idea. She went back to the car. That was a mistake, because she spent the next years turreted in a box smaller than a coffin. The driver raped her with tools and tortured her for years.

# What is intuition exactly?

What is Intuition? We know it exists, it’s described many times in victims’ testimonies. Almost everyone has experience with intuition, but scientifically – what exactly is it?

In my opinion, **intuition is your own emotion coming from your own future**. Because emotions can travel back and forth through time. You send them out all the time, but you can also pick them up. Just yours, not someone else’s. That’s why you can change your past and your future, but not very well someone else’s past and future. You just have to start adapting to it.

# How can I change my past from my future? 

Can you change your past with emotions? Yes, you can. You can “send a message”, but it’s up to your past self to listen to it or not. Don’t worry about how to send that message. You do it nonstop with every strong emotion you experience. You’ve already done it, so reflect on your memories and look for similar things in your past to what I found:

# The Scar

When I was about 15, I did a weird thing. I made a little scar on my right arm with something. It’s about 3 cm. I deliberately scratched the scab to keep the scar. Don’t worry about me, I’m not prone to self-harm. So what was my reason? The reason is a strong emotion I felt that I couldn’t describe at the time. Today, I hope I can. I felt the scar belonged to me. I felt I was used to having a scar on my right arm. And there was none. That was the contradiction I was trying to reconcile. It was the habit of having it. I felt the habit.

About six years later, I was in a serious car accident. Before I crashed, I braced my right hand on the steering wheel. I broke every bone in my right hand from my wrist to my shoulder. I broke a few other things, but that’s not the point. I have a lot of scars on my body from that accident and subsequent surgeries. But the biggest scar (15cm) is on my right hand. It’s in the SAME place as the smaller scar I made myself when I was 15. There’s only a few millimeters between them.

I’ll have the scar from the car accident for the rest of my life. I’m 34 years old today. It’s a habit for me to have one. I’ve spent more years with a scar than without. So it’s more natural for me to have one than not. I feel it belongs to me and always will. It’s a part of me. I have and will have this feeling for the rest of my life, and this is exactly the feeling I had 6 years before the car accident happened! The small scar from my 15 years is physical proof of my theory.

# My wife

I met my wife by accident. She worked as a manager in a clothing store. I was there to claim a pair of shorts. When she introduced herself and shook my hand, I felt a strange emotion. How can I describe that feeling to you? What do you feel when you come home and see your family members? It’s safety, it’s habit, it’s a sense of calm and familiarity. It’s like I’ve known her for years. As well as my siblings.

Of course I didn’t tell her. Because the line “Don’t we know each other from somewhere?” is probably one of the worst pick-up lines.

What did I do? I went back to the store regularly to see her. Over and over again. Believe me, it wasn’t about her great looks or the sympathy that was there either. It was about feeling that particular feeling and exploring it again and again. Exploring exactly what I was feeling. I was interested because I found it strange and interesting.

Today I know what that feeling was. We’ve been together for 10 years. If we don’t get divorced, we’ll be together for most of our lives. I’m used to it. This woman has become a familiar part of my life and my days. If I saw a crowd of people and she was among them, I would immediately know the difference between feeling for her and feeling for other people. And that’s exactly the feeling I felt when she introduced herself to me in the store. I just felt it two years before we started dating.

**Have you found similar events in your past?**

The feeling I had in the past, in one case, revealed my future, and in the other case, changed my future by letting that feeling guide me. If it hadn’t, I wouldn’t be with my wife today.

I realized exactly what intuition is. Intuitions are your own feelings about the future and they can look as different as your feelings today. Stories from the crime podcast describe this exactly as well.

A girl got into a car with a driver who was driving his family. She preferred rational argument to intuition. But intuition has more information. It knows how you will feel in different versions of the future, and because of that, you can choose your version of the future. The one that makes you feel the best.

# How can I change my future from my past?

There are infinitely many versions of the future and they are all in the same place. Different versions of your future experience different emotions in different situations. Some emotions are very strong and are attached to an event, person or thing.

You can explore how you feel when you are deciding on your new job, the person you want to let into your life, or maybe what winning lottery ticket to pick. Intuition is not one emotion. Intuition can be any emotion. You can feel bad about a choice, and conversely you can feel good about a new job choice, for example. There are not just 2 emotions. Learn to be more perceptive through training. What is the emotion you feel from a newly met person? Be specific. Do you feel like something bad is going to happen to you when you are standing on skis at the top of a hill, or do you just have a simple fear? Then it makes a difference whether you obey that feeling or overcome it.

The law of attraction in that book I read says that you can evoke the emotion of achieving anything and thereby cause it to happen. **It’s a similar connection, only in reverse.** Our emotions are not only our compass, but also a rudder that can be turned and changed by our own experiences.

Again, past, present and future are physically in the same place and therefore there is nowhere to travel. They are here. You can only from one layer influence the other and vice versa. Emotions is a vehicle by which you can give a message to yourself.

When you put it all together, you will find that there is one crucial piece of information missing from books and videos about the Law of Attraction. For example, you want to be rich. They tell you to feel like you’re rich. What do you think rich people do? Do it, too. What are they thinking about? Think about it too, and so on. But this doesn’t work because it’s about you and not about others. If you feel the same emotions as Bill Gates, you won’t be in the same situation as Bill Gates because you’re not him. Don’t try to feel like someone else who is already rich. You need to feel like YOU would feel like YOU in a situation where YOU would be rich. That’s the difference.

I know several rich people. And believe me, everyone is completely different. If you get rich, you’ll be different too. Different than the others. You’ll feel different things than others who are already rich.

I've seen a lot of submissions in r/politics claiming slashing congressional delegates' salary and/or benefits would encourage them into taking action.

I could be wrong but I would guess that a significant number of congressional delegates do not consider their salary their primary source of income.

>The current salary (2011) for rank-and-file members of the House and Senate is $174,000 per year. (http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm)

Granted, that's a lot of money to most of us but how much money is it to them?  How much of their salary is spent on lawsuits, cost of living (likely in giant houses, mind you) and other expenses related to being a public figure?

http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/ss/Wealthiest-Members-of-Congress.htm

There are Seven Democrats and three Republicans on that list, in case you were wondering.  That doesn't necessarily mean anything, however.

Let's suppose my hypothesis about congressional delegates' salaries is incorrect.  Let's assume the majority of them do, in fact, rely on their salary as their primary source of income.  If we slash that, aren't we only ensuring that the wealthiest members of congress will want to stay?  Doesn't that mean the people who get kickbacks from chambers of commerce and the more influential (rich) lobbyist groups will be the ones making the decisions?  Doesn't that mean the people representing us will be more likely to profit from tax cuts for the wealthy and other tactics of trickle down economics?

That doesn't necessarily mean they'll support those tactics and this, of course, leads to a debate on the merits of macro economics and the actions of philanthropists like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates (a debate I'm certainly not intelligent enough to have).

I was just thinking that maybe slashing congressional salaries wouldn't be a course of action that would prompt them to act, much less end up beneficial to the common man.

8,Angry about inequality? Don’t blame the rich.,6.0,p3ixk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/p3ixk/angry_about_inequality_dont_blame_the_rich/,37.0,1327958658.0,"This was the big title to an opinion piece in the Outlook section of the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/angry-about-inequality-dont-blame-the-rich/2012/01/03/gIQA9S2fTQ_story.html) on Sunday, January 29, 2012. Having a strong interest in such matters, It drew my attention. The author, James Q. Wilson, argues that the taxing of the wealthy won't end poverty. As I read it, I realized that his views and habits of thought when it comes to the issue of poverty is very identical to that of the masses in general, r/politicaldiscussion included.

>But the mere existence of income inequality tells us little about what, if anything, should be done about it. First, we must answer some key questions. Who constitutes the prosperous and the poor? Why has inequality increased? Does an unequal income distribution deny poor people the chance to buy what they want? And perhaps most important: How do Americans feel about inequality?

I wouldn't consider how Americans feel about inequality to be the most important consideration on the topic of poverty. Wilson along with most people have accepted, though not explicitly, that poverty is only natural and that someone MUST be poor. And so there are those who advocate [Robin-Hood-like taxes](http://robinhoodtax.org/how-it-works) to help/give the poor and those like Wilson who stress the importance of income mobility.

>To answer these questions, it is not enough to take a snapshot of our incomes; we must instead have a motion picture of them and of how people move in and out of various income groups over time...

>Mobility is not limited to the top-earning households. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that nearly half of the families in the lowest fifth of income earners in 2001 had moved up within six years. Over the same period, more than a third of those in the highest fifth of income-earners had moved down. Certainly, there are people such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates who are ensconced in the top tier, but far more common are people who are rich for short periods.

The bottom fifth according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Quintiles) is $0 - $18,500. Most people like to define poverty as a number or dollar amount/range without actually explaining what the numbers mean with reference to food, clothing, shelter, etc.

>The real income problem in this country is not a question of who is rich, but rather of who is poor. Among the bottom fifth of income earners, many people, especially men, stay there their whole lives. Low education and unwed motherhood only exacerbate poverty, which is particularly acute among racial minorities...

>Making the poor more economically mobile has nothing to do with taxing the rich and everything to do with finding and implementing ways to encourage parental marriage, teach the poor marketable skills and induce them to join the legitimate workforce. It is easy to suppose that raising taxes on the rich would provide more money to help the poor. But the problem facing the poor is not too little money, but too few skills and opportunities to advance themselves.

Also the general belief amongst the masses including Obama himself, is that if only poor people had more education and more degrees, all these problems would take care of themselves without realizing that degrees do not create their own demand. No one seems to understand the concept of academic inflation.

The point of this post is that poverty, the lack of or difficulty in securing the basic necessities of human life like food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, etc. is not natural. Why isn't anyone asking why poverty increases when the aggregate wealth of society is increasing? Why the association? Does it not puzzle anyone that abundance brings along with it poverty? Where you find the greatest wealth is where is you find the sharpest struggle for existence amongst the lowest classes, why is that? We have solved the problem of production, why hasn't it banished want? Why are we having to work more and more hours to secure the barest necessities of life instead of working less and less as material progress would suggest? Any ideas?

An American who is more patriot than ""citizen of the world"" must oppose the revelation of classified information because American power in the world is reliant on secrecy. We are less valuable to allies and less fearsome to enemies if our military and intelligence capabilities are known.

Every President or Prime Minister would like the people of his country to be patriotic and the people everywhere else not to be. If we all loved America as much as Donald Trump claimed to, we'd sure be rich. Gates and Buffett would give their money to kids in Chicago and Appalachia instead of Africa and the Middle East. Thankfully, for the children half a world away who suffer from AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Bill Gates is not a patriot. A patriotic man thinks the suffering of foreigners is less important than the suffering of his countrymen. An enlightened man does not. A good man does not.

Last week, in a comfortable room in Moscow, Edward Snowden, the most infamous leaker of U.S. secrets of all time, told NBC anchor Brian Williams that he thought of himself as a patriot. If the motivation for his actions was patriotism, he must have been profoundly naive about U.S. politics. Otherwise he would have realized that the Supreme Court in 1972 and the Church Committee in 1975 and President Ford in 1976--all 3 branches of government in 4 years--tried to rein in the overreach of intelligence gathering and failed. The breadth of U.S. surveillance has only grown. The U.S. Senators and Presidents who promise transparency and easing of our intelligence operations are the same ones who were briefed on the contents of Bin Laden's computer.

Maybe Snowden was aware of the inefficacy of the previous attempts to restrict U.S. intelligence gathering, but in his patriotic fervor believed that the suite of documents he could bring to the American public would be enough to finally exhort change and strengthen the nation. But that sounds awfully foolish for a man shrewd enough to be branded a traitor and still capture American hearts.

All the evidence suggests that Snowden knew that his revelations would weaken the United States, at least in the short term and medium term. His leaked documents eroded the trust our allies had in us and gave our enemies reason to rally against us.

Who is Edward Snowden, then? Traitor? hero? His crime was telling 6 billion people the ways in which the most powerful intelligence community in the most powerful country in the world, which happened to be his own, was spying on all the citizens of the world. And he chose to do it at enormous personal risk. That's the work of a good man. An enlightened man. Not a patriot.",PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Gates

12,Open Borders Day,3.0,20lqpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/20lqpz/open_borders_day/,31.0,1395026295.0,"Today is [Open Borders Day](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/03/open_borders_da.html). [This site](http://openborders.info/blog/two-years-of-open-borders/) is a good resource on the support for open borders. I think there are good reasons why open borders, or at least moving in that direction, should be a high priority for political change for all major parties/philosophies. For example, most of the people who run and follow the Open Borders website are libertarians, but I've also been drawn to it from a more liberal viewpoint. It's natural to support the status quo until we come across strong reasons to prefer otherwise. And for that reason, I didn't think much of existing immigration laws for a long time. But when you really think about it, strict immigration laws are strange and hard to justify.

Consider the following fundamental reasons people often provide as justification for the laws our government should or should not make, which span the whole political spectrum:

1. **People have natural rights/freedoms, which the government should protect, not obstruct.** What does it mean to allow someone to immigrate here? It doesn't mean granting special privileges, or making everyone a citizen. It is merely a person working for an employer at a wage agreed to by both parties, and buying or renting property to live in at a price agreed to with the seller/renter. These are things we all view as very basic rights, which the government should not infringe on without very good reason. Does the location on our earth in which a person was born qualify as a good reason for this?
2. **The government should follow the Constitution and its founding principles.** The U.S. Constitution [only explicitly granted the federal government the power to regulate naturalization (i.e. citizenship), not immigration](http://openborders.info/blog/immigration-and-the-us-constitution/). And we didn't have a single federal law restricting immigration until 1875. Even then, that only restricted immigration specifically for Chinese people. General immigration restrictions came in the 20th century.
3. **The government should alleviate wealth inequality to bring more fairness to the world.** However bad you believe inequality is in our country, [global inequality is far worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP60sIKKJWQ). The median U.S. household earns more than 93% of the world's households, while the bottom 5% of U.S. households earns more than 68% of global households.
4. **The government should reduce its debt.** The main difficulty for our federal budgets going forward is the retirement of the baby boomer generation. Our entitlement programs mainly go toward the elderly with Medicare, Social Security, and even much of Medicaid. Even beyond the cost of public projects, there's a fundamental problem when too large a percentage of our population is too old to work. Allowing more working-age immigrants helps alleviate this. This is why [the CBO estimate of the latest immigration reform bill](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s744.pdf) predicts lower deficits as a result.
5. **The government should do what increases human well-being / makes the world a better place.** Presumably you think it's good to donate money to people stuck in poverty in developing nations? We can help such people much more by simply getting our government to stop prohibiting their ability to move to more stable nations like ours. This isn't just for helping poverty. Some people live in countries in which they lack basic rights. There may be high violence, war, rape, slavery, child soldiers. By what reason can we prohibit people from fleeing those situations into safer countries?
6. **The government should do what grows the economy.** One of the things economists across the political spectrum actually agree on is that [immigration is good for the economy](http://www.independent.org/newsroom/news_detail.asp?newsID=74). A study on open borders estimated that it would [double world GDP](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/20/want-a-global-economic-boom-open-the-borders/). Think of people whose innovations have greatly benefited the world, such as Bill Gates (insert another name if you disagree with that example). Notice that almost all of them had the benefit of being in developed nations. How many potential geniuses, inventors, etc were never able to benefit the world with their abilities simply because they were stuck in places where they had no chance to develop them?

""Open borders"" doesn't necessarily mean that we should let anyone go anywhere no matter what with no oversight. We don't want to allow suspected terrorists to come and go as they please, for instance. But denying someone's basic free movement should be the exception which requires the burden of proof, not the rule.",PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Gates

What can we do to solidify more union?",0.0,2c826v,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2c826v/growing_up_from_the_early_1990s_living_through/,20.0,1406795600.0,"HOLY SHIT, there are so many events and issues that have exploded in this short period.

9/11/2001, housing/financial bubbles, internet company bubbles, cellphones/smartphones, Afghan War, Iraq War, Tax Cuts, droughts, limitless donations political campaign donations, Enron Accounting Scandals, huge oil spill in the Gulf coast (carcinogenic shrimp), extremely expensive healthcare, food inflation, ""income inequality"", LGBT rights, corporate citizenship, Westboro Baptist Church protesting US veteran funerals, conservatives calling for the ""end of Murica"" as if the apocalypse is coming, Hurricane Katrina (scumbag President Bush watching people suffer aboard above New Orleans), Coal mine collapse, streaming porn, and the most inactive Congress, and China becoming our primary import.

There are clearly many more older issues and many of these issues I listed are probably older than my life. But what I've recently noticed is ""HOLY SHIT"" people are getting more and more aggressive towards each other as the issues pile on and on.

At a young age the most politically active topic people often discusses to one another was whether the economy could recover from the recession in the late 80's, then KABOOM, 9/11 happened, people began to discuss more about personal freedoms, people have become more aggressive when just even MENTIONING politics. Politics has become some sort off social taboo from the community I reside under.

The reason I believe society has become more fragmented is due the reactions a multitude of ""things"", 

1. people having to challenge their long old traditions of an ideal American Lifestyles due to the technological/social advances to society. (this is the advent of more advanced electronic devices and the necessity to question social position in society, such as trying to define ""marriage"" and ""sexual equality""

2. The longest/costly wars has made the American public more distraught and indecisive on foreign policy. People have become much more distasteful of ""war"", questioning ""Why they support efforts to fight wars?"", huge federal debts incurred from fighting the wars and loss of American Lives over questionable reasons for engaging a war to look for ""weapons of mass destruction"".

3. Financial mismanagement on both the Public/Private Sector, Detroit the largest municipality in US history declaring bankruptcy, the Enron Accounting Scandal, the Federal government/Federal Reserve System finding a way to save the financial market from near collapse (due to deregulation of the financial system since 1999 with Glass Steagall made unenforcable), huge losses on all US retirees.

4. Immigration disagreements by the general population. I believe this has fragmented many political spectrum. Financially Speaking many ""conservatives"" are split between people who want much more government systemic control, some people who want much more impractical blockades (I'm sorry but building a wall on the US/Mexican border is much larger than France and Germany combined), others who want free borders so that they may be easily hired as cheap agricultural labor. On the more liberal spectrum the fragmentation has become between those who demand more civil rights towards immigrants/asylum seekers through unstreamlined legislation, and those who demand fair immigration status equality (those who received citizenship through the long tedious citizenship application process)

5. Political irony becoming much more blatant, and allegations of political misguidedness between public pundits become much more common practice. Lets be frank here, we are saw John Stewart thrive off of the Mainstream Media, crazed radio conservatives thrive off of literally anything to the extent that the audience is severely effected.

6. the last problem that I think has been an age old one but is growing more hot today is any issue pertaining to ""money""

I want to be honest here, I think many of the problems that we have seen in recent years I think come down to how money is spent throughout politics on both the private/public sector. Major contributors to pundits/campaigns and initiatives. Even billionaires have decided to give up their fortunes, probably not to avoid social fragmentation, but truly doing so for the benefit of societies across the world. (looking at Warren Buffet/Bill Gates). I think the best way to solve many of these issues is to allow for more public debates and let people resolve these issues without any monetary influences.",PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Gates
17,"TIL - According to President Obama, I am one of the “millionaires and billionaires who can afford to pay a little more.”",2.0,13y5zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/13y5zk/til_according_to_president_obama_i_am_one_of_the/,96.0,1354131205.0,"I don't feel like a millionaire nor a billionaire. In fact I feel like every other working American I see on a day-to-day basis. I shop at the same grocery stores and clothes stores. We drive Toyota and Hyundai cars. I mow my own lawn and clean my own house and rarely eat out at restaurants.

I knew when I voted for Obama that, when he spoke of the ""rich"" and the ""wealthy"", he was looking down our street and at neighborhoods just like mine and I should have been better prepared for the likely tax hike we're going to see because we're lumped in with the likes of Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Larry Ellison.

Does anyone else feel that the line of demarcation separating the ""wealthy"" and the upper middle class is just a tad low?

EDIT: To be clear, I am not a millionaire living a modest life.

EDIT 2: Yes, I can afford to pay more - of course I can and I never suggested that I couldn't. My entire purpose of this post was not to grumble at the taxes but to complain about the hyperbole - there's no need to lump people into the ""millionaires and billionaires"" group to drum up support. We're not the ones making zillions and paying 15%.",PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Gates

Now, could somebody explain to me why he is not completely right (except for the bedroom part)?

As I see it (and mostly of Swedes as well I would guess), is that you cannot have full freedom if you choose to be a part of a society/community. You HAVE to ADJUST to the values of the people as whole in order to have a functioning society AND ***contribute*** to that society.

My contention is that the ""pursuit of happiness"" argument is pure bullshit. The only people who are truly happy in the US are those ones who were LUCKY enough to accumulate wealth. And I say lucky because you have to be lucky to get rich (what if Bill Gates never had the opportunity to use a computer in his early days, or Michael Jordan lived in a remote area without a basketball court etc.)

So, I guess my question to you Americans is: How do you define freedom? And why is it more important than equality?

People through out names like Bloomberg, but I think he'd sap nearly only Clinton voters and put Trump in the lead.  Mark Cuban (why are we still talking about him) wouldn't've had a chance.  None of the GOP or Democratic candidates this year could out shadow both Trump and Clinton and conceivably win President.  Jim Webb probably wouldn't be doing better than either.

Even Bill Gates, I think, wouldn't be able to get more support than Bernie did in the primaries.

To those whom much is given, much should be expected.  Lets target the wealthy people who are noncontributing to society.

The problem is, that I think there are a good deal of wealth people who DO give back, DO inspire others, and do contribute to others success.  People like Bill Gates, and Oprah.

So I want to make a list of all the people *we* think should be giving more back to society...  Not just people we think are evil, and not just people we think have too much money, but people who have benefited from the system, and then are not using that to benefit others...  lets name names...

EMERGENCY Call to Action: New Yorkers Say Stop the Bigots, Stop the Hate! Hold Fox News Accountable!

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 23RD ... Rally at South Central Park Gate (59th and 8th Ave) 11AM March to Fox News Headquarters (6th Ave b/w 47th and 48th) 1PM http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=157690534262490

Over the past few months there has been an escalation of hate crimes and bigotry growing throughout our city and country. In particular Muslims, immigrants, and LGBT (lesbian, gay bisexual, and transgendered) people have come under attack and been vilified by hate-mongering politicians such as Paladino and encouraged by media outlets such as Fox News. We must stand together to say no to hatred and violence no matter what group of people is targeted.

Fox news must be held accountable for their hate. On the View, Bill O'Reilly said that ""Muslims killed us on 9/11."" This type of racism encourages violent retaliation against all Muslims. When bigots like Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck and others from FOX NEWS attack gays, muslims, and immigrants each day on mainstream television, we should not be surprised when these attacks begin to take place.

In the past month, at least six LGBT people have committed suicide. A Muslim boy was beaten in his school while being called a ""terrorist."" Hate crimes and harassment have increased against Latinos in schools, workplaces and on the streets. The progressive community needs to come together and take a stand against hatred in all its forms. If we do not stand up to this hate, it will continue to grow!

Join an ad-hoc committee in saying NO TO HATRED! NO TO BIGOTRY! AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL!

Spread the word far and wide!

Join a mass organizing conference call for the march. Individual activists as well as representatives from organizations are welcome.

Saturday, October 16th, 1PM Conference call Info: (661) 673-8600 Access code: 698198#

We would like as many individuals and organizations to sign on to the call to show our unity in stopping this bigotry from spreading. If you are interested, email:marchagainsthate@gmail.com.

-----

EDIT: A number of folks have posted saying this will do nothing - or, that they're sympathetic, but that it's necessary to hit Fox where it hurts (i.e., their bottom line). But to those people I would ask: do you think advertisers will be more nervous of advertising on Fox if people are so upset by what they see on the network that they take the time and energy to get up and do something? Or is it enough for us all just to post anti-Fox articles on reddit? I would argue that actually getting onto the streets is necessary if we want our activism to work (whether around this or any other issue).",politics,Bill Gates

They are trying to end the War on Drugs and increase civil liberties.  ,201.0,frrth,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/frrth/stop_the_koch_brothers_they_are_trying_to_end_the/,632.0,1298552686.0,"The KOCH brothers must be stopped.  They gave $40K to Scott Walker, the MAX allowed by state law.  That's small potatoes compared to the $100+ million they give to other organizations.  These organizations will terrify you.  If the anti-union thing weren't enough, here are bigger and better reasons to stop the evil Kochs.  They are trying to:

1. decriminalize drugs, 
2. legalize gay marriage, 
3. repeal the Patriot Act, 
4. end the police state,
5. cut defense spending.    

Who hates the police?  Only the criminals using drugs, amirite? We need the Patriot Act to allow government to go through our emails and tap our phones to catch people who smoke marijuana and put them in prison.  Oh, it's also good for terrorists.  

Wikipedia shows Koch Family Foundations supporting causes like:

1. CATO Institute
2. Reason Foundation
3. cancer research ($150 million to M.I.T. - STOP THEM! KEEP CANCER ALIVE!)
4. ballet (because seriously:  FUCK. THAT. SHIT.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Family_Foundations

The Kochs basically give a TON of money (millions of dollars) to the CATO Institute.  Scott Walker,  $40K?  HAH!  These CATO people are the REAL problem.  They want to end the War on Drugs.  Insane, right?  We know that the War on Drugs keeps us SAFE from Mexicans and keeps all that violence on their side of the fence.  More than 30,000 Mexicans killed as of December!  Thank God Mexican lives don't count as human lives.  Our government is doing a good, no, a great job protecting us and seriously, who cares about brown people or should I say non-people?  HAHAHA!  Public unions are good, government is good, and government protects us from drugs and brown people.  The Kochs want to end all that.  Look, as far back as 1989 CATO has been trying to decriminalize drugs.  Don't worry, nobody listens to them because they are INSANE.

http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=981

CATO also rejects the Patriot Act.  How can you hate the Patriot Act?  Are you not American?  They made it easy for you to understand by putting the word ""Patriot"" in the legislation.  That means you should vote YES.  Giving up our civil liberties is not a big deal.  We need our government.  Whether it's Obama or Bush, we can all agree that the TSA is really good at what they do.  God, those patdowns feel SOOOO good.

http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10599

The Kochs also support Reason Foundation.  You don't know about that?  Let me tell you.  Basically, REASON Foundation is a bunch of cop haters.   Last month, they did a ""news"" (as if we wanna know!) story on three cops that beat up an unarmed black kid.  In the aftermath, the cops were suspended, sat around doing nothing and got paid (like that's a bad thing!).  I don't know about you, but that puts a smile on my face for four reasons:

1. I hate black people, 
2. I love the police,  
3. I love it when police beat up black people for no reason, 
4. I love that it comes out of taxpayers' money, because it's not like it's really my money.  

The Kochs are trying to end this.  The Kochs must be stopped.

http://reason.com/archives/2011/01/24/a-beating-in-pittsburgh

CATO trying to cut defense spending:

http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-to-cut-military-spending/

Gay marriage.  YUCK.  That's just obvious.  If the KOCH Brothers have their way, there will be homos getting married left and right.  Here's another scary thought:  gays raising children. 

http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6379

Here are some videos from Glenn Greenwald, one of those ""gays.""  He writes for the liberal Salon.com, but don't let that fool you.  He's in the Koch Brothers' pocket.  Here are some videos to prove my point:

Here's Glenn Greenwald talking about drug-decriminalization at REASON:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjuvXdqKM0M&feature=related

Yeah, he's that Glenn Greenwald that also defends WikiLeaks.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XInz4i6AV8M

If there's one thing I know about billionaires, it's that they only care about money.  Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and George Soros.  They aren't fooling me.  Bill Gates isn't fooling me with his vaccination campaign in Africa.  He's just trying to make African children live longer so they will buy more copies of Windows.  Wow.  Not even trying to hide it.  

Now, I don't know why the KOCH brothers want gay people to have the right to marry.  Everybody knows marriage is for a man and a woman.  Even Obama believes that.  Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve amirite?  I haven't figured out the angle, yet.  Maybe it's like this:

1.  legalize drugs
2.  legalize gay marriage
3.  sell drugs, oil and Koch napkins to gays at their weddings
4.  ????
5.  PROFIT$

I don't know exactly how it would work, but we can all agree that they're evil.  Think about it.  CATO and REASON are the only institutions OPENLY advocating these positions.  Who would do such a thing?  Have they no shame?  Minority opinions MUST BE SILENCED.  

Anyway, we must reject everything that the KOCH brothers do in Wisconsin and around the country.  We will succeed as long as we stick to the GROUP-&-THINK.  

YES WE CAN.  The truth is always simple.  You're either with us or against us.

These media conglomerates are using their monopoly over the distribution of public information to control the range of acceptable opinion in this country.  Noam Chomsky nailed it.  By offering up only two parties, both of which are inherently flawed, but allow for vigorous debate between them.  In the end however, it will be one of those chosen by the corporations to begin with.  

   These bills, SOPA, PIPA and now the ""Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011"" are overly broad and yet fast tracked towards a vote despite egregious wording.  Are we naive enough to believe it was haphazardly done?  That this is not a focused campaign to deprive us of our last recourse for free speech on a large scale?  Once they control all the gates through which information flows to the public, they control us all.  
    ACTA is by every definition [treason](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/treason)
 as it exists outside the influence of any democratic body of the people, and its intents and purpose are ""classified in the interests of national security."" 
    This body of corporations and dictators, lets not mince words, decide who is guilty of copywrite infringement and, without legal recourse, imposes sanctions including arrest and imprisonment; for a crime which they can define as they see fit.  How can we pretend to exist in a democracy at this point?  How can you spend even one cent of your money to support a regime who's intent is to bring us all under its rule?  

There is no crueler tyranny than that which is perpetuated under the shield of law and in the name of justice. ~ Charles de Montesquieu

1.Americans under no circumstances are to be monitored by government online unless a warrant is issued by a court of law backed by legitimate probable cause. 


2. Americans under no circumstances are to be denied the right to view or download information on the internet unless it directly conflicts with copyright law or state law.


3.The access to the internet should be available in some form to every american citizen free of charge , much like radio (this could be at a fixed lower speed then competing internet providers who charge for their much higher speeds)


4.Under no circumstances can a person be tried or convicted for viewing information on the internet regardless of its legality , the liability lies only with the person who uploads potentially illegal information.

This country was build on peoples rights and freedoms. The freedom of speech and the right to privacy. Because of SOPA 

and CISPA, those rights are being thrown out the window. We also have the right to a judge and jury. According to another bill being passed or has been passed, the U.S. 

government has right to search with out a warrant. As well as arrest with out cause or judge and jury of American citizens.

I believe that our government is trying to hide these things. They are trying to hide our past. They do not want us to remember what created this country. This country was 

formed because of the unfair taxation and rule of England. The goal was to great a government, where the people chose the president as well as the house of representatives. The 

House of Representatives was created so that no single man could create amendments, bills, or laws. It creates a balance of power, so that any one man can not rule. Yet now, the 

president is allowed to declare war with out the consent of the House of Representatives or senate. The president is also allowed to declare marshal law in times of peace. The 

military has even been practicing for marshal law in civilian areas, according to my research. I have also read that the school system has considered or already chosen to 

withdraw the teaching of anything before the civil war. This will mean that our children will not be taught about the formation of our own country.

Note also that protests have been given harsher punishments, if anywhere near the white house. It can be considered a felony to do so. Yet, if there is a large crown praising 

the president or candidates, then they are over looked.

Did you know that America has more people in prison than any other country in the world? The judicial system is flawed and racist. It also ignores the higher class or lessens 

their punishment. I will gladly give you plenty of examples. A white kid in my neighborhood was a class A sociopath. He killed animals, smoked, drank, and commited crimes. His 

parents didnt care and he was expelled  from every school he went to. He was arrested for 24 hours for nearly commiting negligent manslaughter or something like it. He put 

extacy in a girls drink who had an allergic reaction and nearly died. 24 hours for that. A redneck at my school, purposefully drove over a girls leg and received a $100 dollar 

ticket. Then there is a story of a girl who was beaten, raped, stabbed, raped, beaten, raped, nearly drowned, raped, then left for dead. Three men were arrested and sentenced to 

only 3 years. Now lets compare that to a 15 year old black kids that used an unloaded gun to steal 9 cents from an old man. He then hit him and left. The boy was arrested and he 

pleaded innocent. He was convicted and sentenced for 2-8 years in an adult prison on the basis that he pleaded innocent. He gets up to 8 years for misdimeanor theft and assault. 

Yet the people who all were severly injured, their violators got minimal punishments. There was a man known as, ""Slickrick"", if I remember correctly. After 9/11, he was asked to 

deport from America where he had a multi million dollar business on top the fact that he was an American citizen. He refused and was sent to prison. This is the same thing that 

happened after pearl harbor to all the asians, whether or not they were japanese. Then we all know of this current debate. The young African American who was shot for wearing a 

hoody in a nice neighborhood. It took weeks before the police chose to arrest the man that did it. It is well known that you do not fire unless fired upon, or your life is in 

immediate danger. Unless he had a poisonous skittle, there was no reason to fire.

Now America is not the only flawed country when it comes to judicial system. As much as I love Britian, their system has a flaw. I read a story of a man who was an art collector 

who had thousands of dollars in art stollen over and over. This being on his property, he chose to take it upon himself to protect his posessions. He got a shotgun, which is 

apparently illegal. When the men came to the same place, yet another time, he opened fire. He killed one and severely wounded the other. Because of the use of an illegal fire 

arm, the survivor was able to sue the man. The theif sued the who he stole from. That man was sent to jail as well.

I can keep naming reasons why the judicial system is flawed, but all you need to do is surf the web and youtube for an hour and you will see.

I see change in the future, but whether it be peaceful or war is up to the governments. People has started protesting. People have noticed the wrongs. People are not blind. You 

can only lie for so long. Lies can only go so far. Some people choose to place fear into hearts, but the problem with fear is one thing. With fear, there is the need to survive. 

If you can no longer survive under the fear, you fight. You may not use knives or guns or bombs or nukes. Words are the start of every revolution. Revolutions have no need for 

war. Revolutions can simply be showing people the truth. The world looks at the world they are in and refuse to believe it is falling apart. Those that deny the truth are the 

ones that dont want things to change, but change is coming. A new age is coming and the greed of the world will come to an end. I know of the best solution the our problem at 

hand, but I do not believe people will accept it. I do not wish for anarchy. I do not wish for war. There is enough pain and sadness in the world. All I wish for, is the return 

of our freedoms. The return of our jobs. The return of our family and friends. Millions are homeless and I was and am still near it. Prices are  soaring. To account for it, the 

minimum wage needs to be raised, but if that happens they businesses need to account for that extra pay and will have to lay off millions more. 

There are people like Bill Gates that are sitting on billions and not spending a dime. He gives away 250 million a year, when his net worth is 10 billion or more. That is how 

most the fortune 500 are. These people get off cheap for crimes or make bail for chump change to them. Celebrities get house arrest while the lower class gets years in prison.

All I wish to see is the equality that Lincoln worked so hard for. We are not a seperate people, if anything black people are better than the white. About the only sport that 

white people dominate is hockey. We are not seperate people. We are the same. We work hard day after day to feed our family. We all want Iphones. We all want popularity. We all 

want money. We all want love. We all have addictions. We all have our rough past. Some of us are still living in that rough patch. We all eventually get out and we grow old. We all find love. All guys want sex, ( face it fellas, it is true... just some dont NEED it). All girls want passion and romance. Our children are our future. Do you want the future to maintain its inequality and racism, sexist, and homophobic qualities. No matter of religion, sex, race, or sexuality; we all still have the same wants and  needs. Our fears are holding us back. Our fear are hiding the truth.

The media can tell you one thing, but with technology, people can show you the truth. What is more interesting? Protestors walking with signs with no aggression, or the random few that break windows and place fake bombs? What is more a story? They dont show you the people begging for their rights back. They show people that like a bit of chaos. Yet you will judge a whole group for what one or two did. That sounds familiar. Kinda like black people. One man kills someone, so you assume they are all some how guilty. That is like saying, the mexican that made fun of me in highschool is bad so i will hate all mexicans for the rest of my life. That is not true. Especially since one is about to join the family and one sorta already is.

I have one last thing to say, for now. The government thinks that the have power. They think that they control you. They think they have all the power, but in fact, they have none. Marshal law means nothing if your army refuses to fight. Air force is useless with no pilots. Navy is powerless without men to push buttons. Marines are useless if they wont pull the trigger. The reason the government has no power is because we are their army, navy, air force and marines. Our friends and family are the army. We will refuse to fight without cause. We will refuse to shoot our neighbors. We will refuse to fight for the greedy and the rich. No money in the world will cause us to betray our families. The government has nothing if we do not buy the gas or ipods or computers. We are the consumers, with out us, they are nothing and have nothing. The government wants power but has none. Their power is imaginary. Do not  fear your governments, with out you, they have nothing.

I do not want anarchy, I do not want power, I do not want money. All I want is happiness for all people. I want equality for every religion, sex, race, and sexuality. I want legitimate freedoms while still maintaining and equal system of law and order to prevent chaos. I want what Washington and Franklin wanted all those years ago. I want this to be, Our land.

215,Primer on Citizens United,8.0,fbdca,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fbdca/primer_on_citizens_united/,0.0,1296318811.0,"Every day I see a post related to Citizens United upvoted to the front page.  Most posts express outrage at the Supreme Court's holding that the First Amendment prohibits certain restrictions on a corporation's political speech.  Citizens United is one of the most maligned and misunderstood Supreme Court decisions in recent memory, and I hope that a clear and concise digest of the case will help the hivemind get a better understanding of the case.  Skip to the FAQ section if this is too long.

**Quick Clarification:** Citizens United concerns bans on *direct independent spending* on political speech, not campaign contributions.  At issue was whether corporations can spend their own money to directly engage in political speech by, for example, making and distributing a documentary.  The case did not concern restrictions on how much money corporations can *give* to candidates - in fact, the court suggested that reasonable limits on campaign donations by corporations would be constitutional.

**FACTS:** In 2008, Citizens United, a non-profit corporation, produced the documentary ""Hillary"" critical of Hillary Clinton, then a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.  Citizens United wanted to make the documentary available through on-demand television within 30 days of primary elections.  But the McCain-Feingold campaign reform act of 2002 prohibited corporations and unions from using their funds to engage in ""electioneering communication"" or for speech that expressly advocates for or against specific candidates within 30 days of a primary election.  Violating this law carried criminal and civil penalties.  Citizens United, concerned that broadcasting the documentary would violate the law, challenged parts of McCain-Feingold.

**The Supreme Court Held:**

* The First Amendment, applied to corporations, prevents governmental limits on corporate independent expenditures on political speech.  Therefore, McCain-Feingold's attempt to prevent Citizens United from broadcasting its documentary within 30 days of a primary election is an unconstitutional restraint of political speech.

* The disclaimer and disclosure requirements of McCain-Feingold are constitutional.  Such requirements serve the valid governmental purpose of providing the people with information about political spending, and do not ""chill"" Citizens United's ability to engage in political speech.

**The Court's Reasoning**

I won't get into full details here (for that, I suggest you go to the excellent Scotusblog round-up of opinion, briefs, and analysis [here](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/)).  But here's a quick summary.

As a threshold matter, the Court found that McCain-Feingold, by making it a crime for corporations to engage in political speech within certain days before an election, censored political speech.  Here's how the Court framed the issue:

""Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under {McCain-Feingold}: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate's defense of free speech.  These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.""

Now, the First Amendment (""Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech"") does not forbid *all* restrictions on political speech.  Any law which restricts freedom of speech must pass the ""strict scrutiny"" test - the law must be (1) narrowly tailored to serve a (2) compelling state interest, and must be the (3) least restrictive method of achieving that aim.  This is a very hard burden to overcome.

The Court noted a long history of cases holding that the First Amendment applies to corporations (the government did not dispute this).  The government offered three compelling interests that are served by McCain-Feingold's restrictions on direct political spending:

* **Leveling the Field:** The wealth that's (potentially) available to corporations distorts the field because they can overwhelm other speakers.

The Court has long prohibited speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker.  It does not matter whether the speaker is a person, an association (such as trade unions or the Boy Scouts), or an association that took corporate form.  Similarly, the Court has long held that *wealth* of the speaker is no justification for prohibiting him from engaging in political speech.  The government cannot prohibit George Soros or Bill Gates from spending their billions to push political reforms - if government was allowed to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations, it raises the serious concern that government prohibit *media* corporations from engaging in First Amendment activities.

* **Anti-Corruption:** Allowing corporations to directly spend on political speech either leads to corruption or creates the appearance of corruption.

The Court noted that limits on direct campaign contributions were allowed by the Buckley case because such limits are necessary to prevent the appearance of *quid pro quo* arrangements.  But such interest is not strong enough to allow bans on direct spending, which do not raise similar concerns of corrupt arrangements.

* **Shareholder's Rights:** Dissenting shareholders must be protected from being compelled to fund corporate political speech.

Court's response: dissenting shareholders can vote for new corporate directors, and at any rate, this rationale would allow restrictions on media corporations. 

There was a case - Austin - which approved bans on direct spending by corporations.  This case was only 19 years old, and the Court wrestled with overturning such fresh precedent.  In the end, the Court concluded that First Amendment concerns must lead to Austin being overturned.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Whew!  Are you still with me?  Lawyers never say anything in five words that can be said in five hundred.  Let me attempt to address common questions.

**Why did the Supreme Court say corporations are ""persons""?**

The Court did not specifically address this issue.  There is a long history in American and British law, stretching back to the 17th century, of treating corporations as ""legal persons"" - this is a legal fiction which allows corporations to buy and own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, be taxed, etc.  (For an excellent summary, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fb3o1/we_the_people_of_the_united_states_do_declare/c1emyma).

**But corporations are not real people!  Don't only people have rights?**

The Court doesn't really go into this, but legal associations such as corporations, unions, political parties, recreational clubs, and yes, even Reddit.com, possess certain constitutional protections.  For example, they enjoy (some) Fourth Amendment right to be free of illegal searches and seizures (this is actually really complicated), and can invoke the attorney-client privilege.

The First Amendment has never been restricted to individuals.  For many hundreds of years people have created voluntary associations to advocate - the people behind Citizens United created a non-profit corporation to do the same.  In the Court's view, there was no compelling reason to distinguish corporations and trade unions from other associations, such as newspaper companies, which clearly possess First Amendment rights.

**Does this mean corporations can get married?  Vote?  Own guns?**

No.  The Court only addressed the First Amendment - it did not announce that corporations possess all the rights that human individuals have.  The Court has never held that corporations possess the constitutional right to marriage, vote, or privacy, and the reasoning of Citizens United does not lead to such results.

**So can corporations now give millions and millions to political candidates?**

**No.**  I want to emphasize this because many people on Reddit seem confused about this.  Citizens United *approved* disclaimer and disclosure requirements of McCain-Feingold.  Similarly, it implicitly approved Buckley, a case which upheld restrictions on campaign contributions.

So, government may limit how much a corporation can give to candidates.  It cannot prohibit the corporation from publishing books, buying ad time, making Web sites, and engaging other forms of political speech.

**TL;DR** I attempt to give a primer on Citizens United and answer some frequently answered questions.",politics,Bill Gates
