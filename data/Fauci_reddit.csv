Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

>On Nov. 12, White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, went on The New York Times' podcast The Daily to discuss the current state of the coronavirus **in the U.S. According to Fauci, officials are now starting to see some waning immunity against both infection and hospitalization several months after initial vaccination.** The infectious disease expert pointed toward incoming data from Israel, which he noted tends to be about a month to a month and a half ahead of us in terms of the outbreak.

>**”They are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection but against hospitalization and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all age groups. It isn't just the elderly,"" Fauci said. ""It's waning to the point that you're seeing more and more people getting breakthrough infections, and more and more of those people who are getting breakthrough infections are winding up in the hospital.”**

>**Fauci went on to say, ""I think … that the boosting is gonna be an absolutely essential component of our response, not a bonus, not a luxury, but an absolute essential part of the program.""**

>**According to the virus expert, researchers did not ""have to time"" to do extensive studies to determine whether two doses would be better than three, as there was a pressing need to get vaccines out to people sooner rather than later, which was ""life-saving for millions of people,"" he noted.**

>And as more time passes, we'll be able to see how long the boosters keep recipients protected from COVID—but Fauci is optimistic. **”We don't have the proof yet—the proof of the pudding will be after you get people vaccinated and boosted, and we have a greater durability of protection that doesn't wane as easily.”**

All of these Doctors / Professors who have been slandered and destroyed with nothing to gain. You would rather trust the fucking ""news"" than these people?

Imagine if lockdowns worked and this was over.

Imagine if masks worked an this was over.

Imagine if contact tracing worked and this was over.

Imagine if forced business closures worked and this was over. 

Imagine if travel bans worked and this was over.

Imagine if curfews worked and this was over.

Imagine if the virus mutated to something EVEN MORE harmless and this was over.

Imagine if there was a medicine that just worked and this was over (hint: there is)

Imagine if the vaccine worked and this was over. (hint: it doesn't) 

NO. Every single solution requires global fucking compliance in order to work and the ONLY reason these measures didn't work is because the government didn't have enough CONTROL.

THAT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

You KNOW this because all these fucking assholes are implementing vaccination passports all at the same time as if it makes perfect sense even though the vaccines leak / don't work at all.

They are going to inject the ever loving shit out of you. Same with your kids. Because why wouldn't they?

I believe this may be the first of several LEGITIMATE mass-casualty events that take place. Something is coming this winter. With the majority of people they want left after a cataclysm possibly infertile from the new vaccine, now you can start the mass die off with a controlled smallpox outbreak. The systems for border control, contact tracing, camps and hospitals for infected patients, mass vaccine production and distribution and vaccine tracking are already set up and now we have a real excuse for the use of them when a lethal virus is released. Smallpox will already be hard to deal with in a first world country, and the people that say the vaccine is damaging point to the third world and say wouldn't the NWO want to get rid of them first. The third world would be wiped out with a manufactured smallpox virus, would bring the world to that 500,000,000 number in the guidestone, I would say they want us at atleast less than a billion people. All that are left are just smart enough people that they can enslave, that are also infertile in large numbers from these new vaccines. But thats another story in itself.

They will ease up restrictions on COVID and people will start thinking its already over, or even if your country doesn't do that they will let the vaccinated move freely. They will release smallpox during Christmas, its probably starting right now or very soon so it starts spreading just before people move nationally and internationally for holiday celebrations. Just like C-19 it will released so that it would spreading endemically before Christmas so it becomes pandemic, although

moderna was about to be bankrupt because all of their cancer and heart disease mRNA drugs failed miserably in the clinic and kept killing animals. they publicly talked about a secret ""plan"" they had to turn things around. remember this is the company that never faced any scrutiny because they refused to publish ANYTHING for peer review - ala theranos.

around 2017/2018 we know ecohealth alliance (aka peter daszik) was shopping around his gain-of-function plans to get funding from agencies, including DARPA. they were declined because it was illegal, but NIH (thanks to fauci personally overriding) was happy to oblige

moderna has disclosed in the past that they expanded their pan-coronavirus vaccine program with the NIH in 2015. note that the DARPA leak indicates that SARS-COV-19, the pathogen causing COVID-19, was originally a vaccine (or its precursor virus) that escaped/released from the lab

autists on the internet have figured out that moderna in 2017 patented a synthetic amino acid sequence: CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG that encodes the furin cleavage site (i.e., why covid-19 is able to be so infectious to humans instead of just bats). here's the kicker: that sequence is IN THE GENOME OF COVID-19. if this is truly a synthetic sequence (i haven't seen anything to convince me otherwise) the chance of 16 amino acids randomly being in this order make 1 in a quadrillion look like good odds. read this paragraph again.

remember the hilarious explanation moderna publicly gave. they created their vaccine in TWO DAYS. they freely admit they took one of their existing preclinical NIH projects (for MERS) and swapped in the spike protein sequence they received directly from China/NIH. anyone familiar with drug manufacturing understands this is complete bullshit, especially given every single attempt at doing this in animals before was fraught with animal deaths. so the hilarious revelation is they pulled a bill gates and created the virus and sold the anti-virus (literally lmao - the bill & melinda foundation funded moderna $100mn for work on HIV)

this is the smoking gun that proves the virus was lab created, using NIH funds and the scaffolds originated at moderna. so moderna literally created both COVID-19 and then scammed taxpayers out of hundreds of billions of dollars by lobbying the government to force citizens to get their clotshot under threat

Here's what will happen next: Biden, Fauci, and Co. will continue preaching the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, Omicron cases will rise, more pressure to get vaccinated, talking heads and politicians will blame the unvaccinated for allowing the virus to continue, all while people continue dying from adverse reactions to the vaccine, reports of children dying from Omicron symptoms including myocarditis will dominate the press, more blame on the unvaccinated, lockdowns will ensue, tensions will rise, the divide will be complete, the unvaccinated will be ostracized and punished for the world's suffering, protocols for digital verified vaccination records will be implemented (as media will claim falsified vaccination cards are on the rise) the unvaccinated will be forced to be re-educated in covid camps, and at this point it will be too late as the global population is dwindling, supply chains will break down even further, millions will starve, and any of the remaining unvaccinated will be rounded up and will be made into an example.

Australia has a population of 25 million people, so that means there are **eleven (11) vaccines** (2 original + 9 boosters) reserved for every Aussie man, woman & child. Assuming 70% of the total population get vaccinated (including 5-11 year-old kids, roll-out will begin on 10 January 2022), that means there would be **sixteen (16) vaccines** (2 + 14 boosters) per vaccinated person who consents/is coerced to continue to 'boost'.  
  
Of course, if the COVID vaccines worked as promised, Australia would only need to order 25 million doses (or 50 million doses for a 2-dose treatment), NOT 280 million doses. So, every Australian who's double-vaccinated will need to prepare for at least 14 more booster injections.  
  
Of course, if the COVID vaccines worked as promised, all heavily-vaccinated countries including Australia, would have reached herd immunity by now. For the USA, Dr Fauci had long cited **60% to 70%** as the level of COVID infection/vaccination the country would need to achieve herd immunity — for the disease to fade and life to return to normal. He then changed the goalposts to **""70, 75 percent""**, then to **""75, 80, 85 percent""**, and again to **""75 to 80-plus percent""**. He then threw away the goalposts and no longer mentions herd immunity, nor natural immunity from COVID infection.  
NYT: Fauci acknowledges moving goalposts on herd immunity from COVID-19: https://www.axios.com/fauci-goalposts-herd-immunity-c83c7500-d8f9-4960-a334-06cc03d9a220.html
  
The COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials tested up to 2 doses (depending on vaccine type), and the vaccines were approved for ""emergency use"" based solely on that data. Since then, a third dose (booster #1) was tested on live populations around the world (Israel was the first country to test a 3rd dose, and other countries soon followed). All additional boosters will also be tested on live populations.
  
I'm an Aussie and I will never consent to these experimental vaccines (not the 1st injection, and certainly not the 11th).  
30% of my extended family are in the same boat. We choose to preserve the organic immune systems we were born with.  
Hold the Line.

The UK government has admitted that once you have been double-vaccinated, you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity to Covid variants - or possibly any other virus. So let's watch the ""real"" pandemic begin now! In its Week 42 ""COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report"", the UK Department of Health admits on page 23 that ""N antibody levels appear to be lower in people who become infected after two doses of vaccination"". It goes on to say that this drop in antibodies is essentially permanent. What does this mean? We know that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus (indeed, the report elsewhere shows that vaccinated adults are now much more likely to be infected than unvaccinated ones). The British now find that the vaccine interferes with the body's ability to make antibodies after infection not only against the spike protein but also against other parts of the virus. In particular, vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the envelope of the virus, which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein, even if they have already been infected and cured once or more. The unvaccinated, on the other hand, will gain lasting, if not permanent, immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once.

# 1.- Graphene 

You probably heard of people getting magnetized after their shots. Graphene oxide in the shots is not a mystery. \[it is even listed as the main component in Chinese vaccine patents\]( [https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en)). 

Graphene is a fantastic invention. A material several times more conductive than copper and that can be of 1 atom of thickness.

\[These are the words from the inventor\]([https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate](https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate)), Nobel prize winner Konstantin Novoselov, about the uses of graphene regarding this pandemic 

This is a full rabbit hole. Graphene is in everything. I am sure graphene is what Julian Assange called \[""The smart evil dust that is everywhere and in everything""\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc)). I suggest going down this rabbit hole to fully understand what is going on

Remember these vaccines are genetic technology? So, using graphene oxide as a carrier could mean maybe your DNA, your life blocks, are turning into electricity superconductors. Tiny little computers. Why?

# 2.- The Great Reset 

This is an agenda of the World Economic Forum. I believe what we are living now is a biological war, a planned pandemic. The virus was designed for the vaccines, not the other way, in order to begin the shift into the digital world. It makes sense, we needed a crisis and fear of the people to comply with a universal vaccine mandate.  There is soft evidence that show you this crisis has been planned. Of course I don't have a video of Fauci or Schwab or the CCP saying "" hehe, we are going to release this virus and make everyone comply"". At this point, you have to use common sense. If you are okay with this, lets keep going.

Devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn? I´ll talk about this, but first, vax passes enter the game. If you live in a place where vax passes are active, you probably have to show a phone app QR code or the classic paper card.

 Ever heard of the \[Quantum dot tattoo?\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/)). You probably know the temperature scanners that are in every store entrance. Let me tell you by experience, these are bullshit, they don't work, they just throw random numbers. The function of these scanners is to prepare people when they actually have to scan their Quantum Dot Tattoo. I am talking about the future now, so I must stop to not lose credibility in my statements, I am just linking the dots of the ""Internet of Bodies"".

According to the DOD whistleblower, HIV cases are up 590% year over year among those tested. But how many people would even consider testing for HIV if they aren’t in any risks groups?

Asymptomatic HIV infection is the second stage of HIV/AIDS. During this stage, there are no symptoms of HIV infection. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection or clinical latency. During this stage, the virus keeps multiplying in the body and the immune system slowly weakens, but the person has no symptoms.

Theoretically, all those “covid” infected vaccinated that got sick with “flu like” symptoms and were diagnosed with covid are possibly  carrying HIV. They’ve “recovered”, but this is just until their body runs low on t-cell counts. 

The uptick in HIV news and testing by the media could be a soft disclosure of what’s ahead for those who are vaccinated.

So here’s my theory of what’s going to happen:

1. More states will start to de-criiminalize knowingly spreading HIV to people

Soon it will be announced that it was a leaked virus from wuhan. Then months later it will be announced it was an experimental bioweapon. Just watch.

Well my mom was listening in and she started getting mad, ""See OP, thats not true, everything you listen to is misinformation, this is why I can't believe anything you say, just listen to the false information in that video!""

I busted out laughing. I said ""This is actually propaganda YOUR narrative was telling you a few months ago in order to get vaccinated!""

She said ""huh?""

So I showed her the video.

She was getting madder and madder as she watched, and finally concluded the video was fake!!!!!

Update: Many seem to be getting on me for living at my parents. Listen, I don't want to be here lol. Covid took everything from me. 78% of my country is vaccinated, I've been ostracized from society, lost my girlfriend,  lost almost all my friends, my cat died, I can't go back to my career without getting vaccinated, and to top it all off, I'm living back home after living by myself since I was 18 (I'm 30 now).

So yeah. I hear everyone loud and clear lol. My number 1 priority is getting out of here. In the mean time, this is my life. Getting vaccinated would get me out immediately...but I have integrity and I refuse to be coerced into an experimental vaccine. I know what I'm standing up for will be the right side of history, even if it means my life is harder for a few years.

Update²: It's obvious who the vaccinated ones are in the comments. Jeez, zero empathy from them as usual. Incapable of comprehending the struggle we currently face.

The first time I realized this pandemic is a bag of lies was when they let BLM and Biden supporters gather without masks and faced zero scrutiny from msm. I recovered completely and because of my skepticism, I chose not to get vaccinated, which is trigger fuel for pretty much everyone I interact with.

Fast forward to this past month… my housemates come down with COVID, presumably omicron, and we stay put instead of going home for the holidays. Out of the three of us, I’m the only non vaxxed but everyone has had COVID before.

Through lots of research, I became confident that I had natural immunity and wagered that I wouldn’t be reinfected. My brothers gf is a nurse and said it’s impossible that I have natural immunity/don’t get reinfected. At this point my entire family is furious because of my vax status and want anything they can get their hands on to prove me wrong. 

Brother and I get PCR tests, his comes back positive and mine comes back negative. Family doesn’t believe my test was accurate and speculates I’d come down with COVID a few days after the test. Well, I was forced to take a second test today and to their total shock, I came back negative again. 

Natural immunity tangibly proven, even after a year.

The gf, who is triple jabbed, actually gave the virus to our house ironically. My critics based all their “facts” off fauci fear mongering and msm propaganda.

Israeli doctors confirm contract with Pfizer says no injury reports can be released for ten years.

The cdc tells us that masking and social distancing eradicated the flu last year. (even though millions of people get the flu vaccine every year and the flu evolves rapidly year after year)

Pfizer destroyed any real clinical efficacy of  expirements when a month after they started the initial double blind/placebo trials they informed all those inoculated with the placebo and then gave them the real vaccine anyway.

Now, after getting vaccinated, they are starting to see that hospitalizations and deaths are now occurring in ALL AGE GROUPS, and no longer just the elderly.

Don't take my word for any of this, fact check everything. Use multiple sources, filter results to exclude 2020 to drown out a lot of the noise if need be.

I never ask anyone to share anything, but if you would not mind sharing this one, please do, and yes, it is original content.

There are violent revolutions and well-funded protests occurring parallel to a novel pandemic with unprecedented countermeasures around the world.

A man shot 20 some people and we reformed gun laws within 2 weeks, a month later an independent nonpolitically aligned media (MacLean’s) publishes an article that it is very likely the killer (who was dressed as a police officer, in a police car) was likely an RCMP agent, the evidence is actual video footage of said individual going to a Brinks chartered bank and withdrawing (not stealing) $490,000\~ dollars in physical cash.

meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter are moderating the US President, or anyone against the Hong Kong movement, in parallel. Hidden 

Camera footage gets released showing the Facebook ‘Community Moderation Team’ admitting to moderating anything that is against their viewpoint and being lenient to anything that is against their terms, but pro their viewpoint.

Real-time video, actual live video, is showing me things, the news is then reframing in front of my eyes, both sides of the news, as completely different things. Of course, each ‘side’ spins its own narrative, both deviate from the thing I watched with 2000 people happen in real-time.

The WHO / CDC / world health organizations have released conflicting information more times than I can count at this point. Not conflicting in the sense that naturally, science evolves, and new information comes to light, but even things we already knew made sense to be told don’t make sense to then be told make sense again (Looking at you Facemasks)

A vaccine is being purposed by Bill Gates inside of 12 months, Bill Gates is not a medical professional, and a vaccine has never been made that fast in the history of man, nor is it recommended a vaccine be made that fast for what I assumed were obvious reasons. (Just to clarify, I got a vaccine six months ago after a meat scare at a deli when I went home for Christmas, I am in no way shape or form ‘Anti-Vaxx’ but if I am brave enough to question this in a public forum, that is what you assume)

The world economy is crashing, joblessness all-time high, governments printing money in buckets for social assistance inflating the currency. This is not localized; this is a global occurrence. New studies are being released showing the income disparity of people has shifted quite suddenly since the beginning of Sars-CoV-2, and not in the way we were hoping it shifts.  


It was 34 degrees outside today, 2 days ago was the first day of summer.

Australia gets hit by a state-sponsored cyber-attack (suspected China), PM gives a national address on getting hacked, never saw that before, the Australian intelligence community releases statement ‘They were going for the crown jewels’  


Four months in the house, I still do not know anyone who has even contracted CVOID, asked over 1000 personally, personally asked them, have a \*redacted\*, over 20 years, \*redacted\* joke about it being a fake virus.

DR. Fauci admits, hands down admitted the government intentionally mislead the people about facemasks to assure availability for health care workers

Five pharmacies out here personally told me; our \*redacted\* population bought all the facemasks early February.

COVID 19, which statistically kills minorities in the black and Spanish population the most, is somehow not killing any of the people in the live streams I have been watching for over 3 weeks, not one person has contracted it in the community of 'CHAZ/COP'

COVID 19, which has a zero-immunity factor in our current society, should be expanding exponentially. In most of the world, it has shown linear growth. All statistical models were entirely off, all of them off in a direction that justified society locking down, the same politicians were telling you if you visited your grandma, they would die, but also telling you, if you were outside yelling (a great way to spread droplets) you were doing your civic duty.

1000 health care professionals signed a statement saying COVID 19 should not hinder civil protesting, two weeks previously, they said to stay home save lives. 

No one is saying racism does not exist, no one is saying black lives don’t matter, people are being fired from jobs for saying all lives also matter, no one is disagreeing what happened to George Floyd was not murder, everyone agrees the people responsible in that incident should be prosecuted, multiple weeks of protests, during a pandemic.

During the lockdown, neighbors who were friends for years starting calling the police on each other, over COVID concerns, these same people a week later are posting #defundThePolice

There is an autonomous/occupied zone in Seattle, the mayor called it a summer of love, I have watched people get shot 3 nights in a row, live, on a platform I used to watch people play video games on.

New York Mayor sends infected COVID 19 patients to retirement homes, massive deaths in elderly, only 1 field hospital built ever saw a patient, the ship was never utilized, the president was blamed?

I am watching people post memes about being sorry for racism who have never been racist, I am watching guys I know from my old life who sold drugs to Sixteen-year-old girls, sometimes for sexual favors (they were 18), calling people racist on Facebook, and no one is saying anything about it.

This list is probably not even 50% completed, and tomorrow there will be entirely new things to add to the burning tire fire of 2020. No one individual can even keep up with all this without mentally exhausting themselves (did I mention it was 32 degrees outside).

That is not even the worst part,

the worst part is I see someone I have respected for years, and they are not even willing to acknowledge any of these things, and give generic answers like, 'don’t believe what you read on the Interwebs, as if I would ever, ever, ever, make my mind up without qualifying various sources unless of course, there is literal unedited footage of the said event.

Addendums:

\- Contract tracers in the states, tasked with finding out who someone that has been confirmed with COVID has been around, are not allowed to ask if they attended protests, in fear they won't come in to get tested

\- Both IOS and Android have implemented low-level access for new higher abstracted contact tracing apps, essentially turning every phone into an opt-in (for now ) BLE beacon

\- Italy recently confirmed after testing sewage samples from December of 19 that COVID 19 was present in enough abundancy to pass a test on a diluted sample. Shattering the current narrative of China / Wuhan being the epicenter",conspiracy,Fauci

It's similiar to how ISIS conveniently decide to go quiet then only show up whenever TPTB need them to terrorise the West to help justify a foreign intervention

Or how corona coincided with when a global recession was meant to happen after a record amount of CEOs stepped down. 1 month after Bill Gates' pandemic press run, his eerily accurate warnings, event 201 and his netflix documentary. All in the same window Fauci predicted it would happen. Amazing how the stars aligned for the two parties who served to gain the most from the pandemic.

wayyy off topic but...

If you know who Bill Cooper is you'll know he predicted the 1993 WTC bombing, he predicted 9/11 and he predicted a staged civil war in America. By energising these dichotomies (right - left, blue lives - black lives, men-women) TPTB are dividing and conquering and setting the stage for this war and martial law in cities. There's footage of agent provocateurs going around breaking windows and starting riots. They've made us hate foreign enemies they themselves created and are in the process of making us all hate one another one the same soil.

I'd say around half of us in here are smart enough to know that if they push something down our throats it's because they want us to react a certain way or it's to distract us from an even worse truth. If racial tension and riots negatively affected TBTP in any way they would not exist anymore. The youth are no longer concerned about the quasi-communist coup that just swept their futures out from underneath them.

Some people in this sub have a tendency to hate TPTB/understand the full scope of their evil and how they've polluted humanity, but not extend that understanding to black people. They'll watch someone get executed and dig up his past to try and justify his death, taking sides with murderers. I'm not asking those types to show empathy, I'm asking us all to not fall for either side of the rage and to keep our sights on the evil at the top, not the ball of string below.

What I'm looking for are details about the officers from the last round of police brutality killings, I used to hear murmurings about them being trained somewhere else in military? Israel maybe? idk.

—-America's vaccination rate at 54% but cases still rising and restrictions still imposed.

The state of Uttar Pradesh in India, which has the equivalent of two-thirds of the United States population, has been declared COVID-free, the state government announced last week.

There are no more active cases of coronavirus in the 33 districts of Uttar Pradesh, which has a population of 241 million people.


“Overall, the state has a total of 199 active cases, while the positivity rate came down to less than 0.01 per cent. The recovery rate, meanwhile, has improved to 98.7 per cent,” Hindustan Times reported.

How is it that Uttar Pradesh has fully recovered from COVID despite the fact that only 5.8% of its population has been fully vaccinated, compared to the USA that has 54% fully vaccinated?

The answer is likely because of the government’s early use and distribution of ivermectin to its citizens.

From the Indian Express:

“Uttar Pradesh was the first state in the country to introduce large-scale prophylactic and therapeutic use of Ivermectin. In May-June 2020, a team at Agra, led by Dr. Anshul Pareek, administered Ivermectin to all RRT team members in the district on an experimental basis. It was observed that none of them developed Covid-19 despite being in daily contact with patients who had tested positive for the virus,” Uttar Pradesh State Surveillance Officer Vikssendu Agrawal said.

He added that based on the findings from Agra, the state government sanctioned the use of Ivermectin as a prophylactic for all the contacts of Covid patients and later cleared the administration of therapeutic doses for the treatment of such patients.

Claiming that timely introduction of Ivermectin since the first wave has helped the state maintain a relatively low positivity rate despite its high population density, he said, “Despite being the state with the largest population base and a high population density, we have maintained a relatively low positivity rate and cases per million of population.”

He said that apart from aggressive contact tracing and surveillance, the lower positivity and fatality rates may be attributed to the large-scale use of Ivermectin use in the state, adding that the drug has recently been introduced in the National Protocol for Covid treatment and management. “Once the second wave subsides, we would conduct our own study as there has been an emerging body of evidence to substantiate our timely use of Ivermectin from the first wave itself,” Vikasendu told The Indian Express.”

One would think the World Health Organization, Big Pharma, the mainstream media, and Dr. Anthony Fauci would be overjoyed by this development that ivermectin is undoubtedly saving lives.

But the moment he mentioned that, in addition to getting mercury out of fish, it was important to get the mercury-derivative thimerosal out of vaccines, he lost his speaking gigs, his editorials, basically his career as he knew it.

If we can get Kennedy replatformed on Joe Rogan, it will give him access to the largest single audience on the planet, and would be a big FUCK YOU to legacy media and Big Pharma. Kennedy's new book, The Real Anthony Fauci, has already been mentioned multiple times on the podcast by other guests, but like I said, those guys are lightweights compared to Kennedy. He was cancelled before ""cancel culture"" was even a phrase.So let's make this happen. Sure it's a long shot, we're just some dweebs on a conspiracy forum, but there's nothing to lose.

I’ve heard discussions about what vaccine everyone took, complimenting each other and jokingly saying what vaccine is better over the other one.

183,Bombshell Oxford Study: Less than 6% of “Approved” Medical Drugs Are Backed by “High-Quality Evidence” to Support Their Benefits – “Harms” are Significantly Underreported Across the Board,720.0,vhazua,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vhazua/bombshell_oxford_study_less_than_6_of_approved/,62.0,1655810417.0,"**By** **Julian Conradson**

According to a [**newly released study**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435622001007#!) by the University of Oxford, a jaw-dropping [**94% of recently approved medications**](https://www.theepochtimes.com/94-percent-of-medication-not-supported-by-high-quality-evidence-harms-underreported-study_4541149.html) are not supported by high-quality evidence that demonstrates their benefits. What’s more, just like with the experimental Covid-19 ‘vaccines,’ side effects and adverse reactions to these drugs are being severely underreported across the board.

When looking at medical drugs that have been approved since 2008 under the Cochrane reviews – a “[**leading**](https://www.theepochtimes.com/94-percent-of-medication-not-supported-by-high-quality-evidence-harms-underreported-study_4541149.html)” international journal and database that is endorsed by over 100 organizations worldwide, [**including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**](https://methods.cochrane.org/news/open-response-fda-clinical-data-summary-report-pilot) \-researchers determined that just 87 of the 1,567 medications (6%) had clinical data that met the “high-quality” standard.

From the [**Oxford study**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435622001007#!):

>*“Of 1567 eligible interventions, 87 (5.6%) had high quality evidence on first-listed primary outcomes, positive, statistically significant results and were rated by review authors as beneficial.”*

Unbelievably, the majority of these drugs could not even pass the ‘moderate-quality’ review, with over 50% failing to meet the reduced threshold. And yet, consumers have access to these drugs, which are causing unknown and underreported side effects – something that should amount to medical malpractice at the very least. That is – if we lived in a sane, well-functioning society.

One of the study’s authors, Dr. Jeremy Howick, [**certainly thinks so**](https://www.theepochtimes.com/94-percent-of-medication-not-supported-by-high-quality-evidence-harms-underreported-study_4541149.html). Writing about the findings, Dr. Howick [**deemed**](https://www.theepochtimes.com/94-percent-of-medication-not-supported-by-high-quality-evidence-harms-underreported-study_4541149.html) the issue worrisome and stressed that, with this happening, ‘informed choice’ about medical treatments is essentially impossible.

From Dr. Howick, via **The Epoch Times**:

>*“It is particularly worrying that the harms of healthcare interventions are rarely quantified… For a doctor or patient to decide whether to use a treatment, they need to know whether the benefits outweigh the harms. If the harms are inadequately measured, an ‘informed choice’ is not possible…*  
*…Potential harms should be measured with the same rigor as potential benefits. The evidence-based medicine community is correct to continue calling for higher-quality research, and also justified in their skepticism that high-quality evidence for medical treatments is common or even improving.”*

It’s bad enough that these treatments were approved while lacking evidence showing they work, but these experimental drugs are also causing an untold amount of additional damage, with over 1/3 being linked to adverse reactions that are being underreported.

Nearly 10% of the approved medications were found to have “significant evidence of harm.”

From the [**study**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435622001007#!):

>*“Harms were measured for 577 (36.8%) interventions, 127 of which (8.1%) had statistically significant evidence of harm.”*

In the end, researchers simply [**concluded**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435622001007#!) that “most healthcare interventions studied within recent Cochrane Reviews are not supported by high-quality evidence, and harms are under-reported.”

The Oxford study closely mirrors [**another recently published study**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2758605) out of the US that also found issues with medications being fast-tracked for public use without the proper supporting evidence. [**Published in JAMA,**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2758605) the US researchers found that the FDA had systematically relaxed its once-rigorous process to approve new drug treatments beginning in the 1980s – coincidentally right around the time Fauci entered the picture.

Between 1983 and 2018, as the number of new drug applications and approvals increased, the review period decreased. According to researchers, this happened because the FDA was, and still is, [**cutting corners**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2758605) on the clinical work to support these drugs’ safety and effectiveness. The study [**concluded**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2758605) that the agency “increasingly accepted less data and more surrogate measures” when approving new medications.

When you consider the fact that [**medication release prices**](https://www.theepochtimes.com/median-drug-launch-price-85-times-higher-compared-to-2008_4520343.html) are an astonishing 85x higher than they were in 2008 (thanks Obamacare) – let alone the absolute horrors of the experimental vaccine, which was just approved for babies and toddlers – this is beyond criminal. The last thing our so-called ‘public health experts’ are concerned about is saving lives.

The FDA is criminal.

The system is captured.

They are talking about really boring stuff to. For 4 years the media loved the drama with Trump. It sold “news”. And yet the lack of interest of drama with Biden causally joking about Pedophile is insane. 

I believe Trumps true Legacy is that he exposed the media. The media couldn’t stand the fact that Trump was able to call bull shit personally. The media called for Trump to be BANNED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. What media in a supposedly Free Nation does that? And in the end they finally did censor Trump and his voter base. Reddit was the 1st Social Media platform to do it by banning the Donald for “making threats against Police and Politicians”. Then when George Floyd hit they allowed hundreds of subs to make continuous threats against Police and Politicians who stood up for Police. No bans from those subs. Why? Because Reddit got onboard the woke Social Jerk Hive Mind.

219,"Remember that time in the 80s when contaminated Polio vaccines caused the HIV pandemic which was treated with a cure worse than the disease while the CIA blamed deaths caused by a dewormer in the cocaine they sold on AIDS to sweep the death toll under the rug? Also, Fauci!",618.0,pv09jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pv09jp/remember_that_time_in_the_80s_when_contaminated/,159.0,1632546813.0,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7935079/

First, the vaccines were contaminated by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus which eventually mutated into Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

The two viruses are only slightly genetically different.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2831797/

But that being said, there is still a chance that there were actually 2 causes of AIDS deaths. HIV as well as the cocaine the CIA was selling to finance their operations.

But cocaine doesn’t cause AIDS rah rah rah. No, it does not. But an ingredient being used to cut cocaine in the 80s did. Levamisole.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamisole

“Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis.”

However, repeated exposure to Levamisole is documented to cause symptoms which are basically AIDS symptoms.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498128/

In case you didn’t know, the CIA sold massive amounts of cocaine in the US to fund their operations (not a theory it’s totally proven).

Because the CIA wanted to cover their tracks, they networked with health services to make sure that patients who were HIV negative suffering from immune system issues caused by Levamisole were still given an HIV diagnosis based on symptoms alone and not on a positive PCR test. Sound familiar lately?

To further compound things, there is a chance that HIV might not even be lethal in human populations.

https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hiv-aids-fact-or-fraud/

So there you have it. Vaccines caused HIV. There’s a chance the cures for HIV were worse than the virus (AZT) and even that the virus didn’t cause any deaths at all. Again, a dewormer had something to do with it. 

Welcome back to the rabbit hole.

Also, Fauci was heading the HIV response back in the day and just like this time around made millions on a cure which may have been worse than the disease.

Maybe it’s time to stop putting up with any of this and just go back to farming our own food. I’d rather just take my chances than be a pawn in any of these types of games!

Edit: Someone in the comments pointed out that the Hep B vaccines given to gay men in the USA were also tainted with the same virus so there’s that too. Fact checked and it pans out as well.

I don’t want the Covid vaccine because I don’t have any fear of the virus given my age demographic and I don’t want to start taking vaccines for this virus that will inevitably end up with having to take more vaccines or boosters every single year once the vaccine wares off and/or every time a new variant comes out.  I’ve already had Covid, but even if I never got Covid I would rather just get the virus and be out for a couple weeks and reach a level of natural immunity instead of jabbing myself with a new vaccine of booster every 6 months in an attempt to run away from a virus that I would get anyway.  

I understand that having the vaccine lessens my chances of having to go to the hospital or die, but the chances of either of those two things happening to somebody that is 30 years old and fairly healthy is virtually zero.  So I wouldn’t be going to the hospital to “fill up all the beds” like a lot of people bring up.  

When it comes to me getting the virus and transmitting it to others, that is already happening with vaccinated people.  And they say that the only reason that is happening is because the unvaccinated are allowing the virus to mutate, making the old vaccines ineffective.  But what is stopping a virus from mutating within a vaccinated population?  Fauci already said that we are never getting rid of Covid as a virus, so why force people the vaccinate themselves every 6 months over a virus that is never going away?  If Covid is never going away, does that mean that if every person were to be vaccinated then Omicron would necessarily be that last variant?  That doesn’t make sense to me.  There will surely be several other variants.  

So if this virus is going to exist with us forever, I’m not seeing the reason why there is this insanely aggressive push to get everybody vaccinated.  Seems to me like the only externality that exists is the possibility of people filling up hospital beds.  But have you seen the amount of money that our government has to spend?  Use that money to ramp up the capacity of the hospitals instead of spending it on some stupid plan that you can slap a little inspiring slogan on that you can use in your next election campaign.  The reasons for forcing Covid vaccines on people is not convincing, therefore you have to come up with a plan to handle the results of that.  

The last thing is the dishonesty of the media and our pro-vax mandate politicians.  They act like people that don’t want the vax are just knuckle dragging idiots that think our “overlords” are trying to kill us or plant us with microchips.  If I took the vaccine, I wouldn’t plan on dying and I also wouldn’t think I had been planted with a microchip.  They act like we are incapable of making basic risk assessments.  My reasons for not getting the vax is as simple as, this virus is not going away, it will likely just act like another strain of the flu in the future, so I’m not starting this pattern of injecting myself with some different booster every 6 months to a year for the rest of my life over something we can’t prevent from existing and has no serious chance of hurting me.  But they can’t allow a reasonable opinion about not getting the vax to be spread.  You’re either pro vax, or you’re a Qanon, basement dwelling, tin foil hat wearing psycho that is responsible for all Covid deaths because of your “dangerous” opinions on the vax.  

It all seems to me to be more political than it is a genuine effort to respond to the virus.  They began calling it the “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.  That is such a disgusting thing to do.  They roll out these “vaccines” that basically just act as medicine to lessen symptoms of a virus that is never going away, and then they start calling people that don’t want it the ACTUAL virus.  “Pandemic of the unvaccinated” means that the people that don’t want the vax ARE the pandemic.  They ARE Covid.  Meaning that they’re directly responsible for the deaths of everybody that had died from Covid.

It’s tested us, sown division, and repeated the lives of many people. However, my interest lies in the immense polarization of Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician who, up until March 2020, was a widely renowned and celebrated figure in the federal government as a *scientist* and *physician* since 1984, when he was appointed director of the NIAID. Of course, the institute helped the United States out of a lot of epidemics, most notably the AIDS epidemic, which got him the Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush in 2008. 

One important thing to acknowledge is Dr. Fauci is non-partisan. He has served under multiple presidents of both parties. He has never stated his political identity, nor has he induced any sort of political agenda, other than conquering epidemics in America. Of course, some could view this as a political ploy, but for someone who refuses to state their partisan affiliation, it’s highly unlikely. Fauci currently serves as President Biden’s Chief Medical Advisor, an important role in the Presidency and one established in 2019 by President Trump, meaning Fauci is only one of two people to ever hold the position. 

So, why does a man like Dr. Fauci, a strictly non-partisan award winning physician-scientist suddenly become a icon of hate and remorse for people? While they may not agree with his advice, it certainly isn’t backed by any political pundit. It has interested me for a long time and I’m curious to hear what you all have to say about it.

The Chief Justice wrote for the Court in _Trump v Vance_, affirming the Second Circuit and rejecting the Government's position that, under Article II and the Supremacy Clause, the President was entitled to absolute immunity and a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoenas. The case now goes back to the district court, where the Second Circuit permitted the Government to make alternative arguments. The vote was 5 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), 2 in concurrence with the decision (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).

The Chief Justice also wrote for the Court in _Trump vs Mazars_, vacating the lower court ruling affirming the Congressional subpoena and implementing a balancing test for the district court to consider in deciding whether to grant a Congressional subpoena, including:

(1) whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants subpoenaing the President and his papers (ie. whether there are other sources that Congress could obtain this information from);

(2) whether the scope of the subpoena is sufficiently narrow so that it is no broader than necessary to support Congress' legislative objective;

(3) what the nature is of evidence Congress is offered to establish that a subpoena is necessary to advance a valid legislative agenda; and

(4) what burden is imposed on the President, particularly since the subpoena originates from a rival branch of government that could use such subpoenas for institutional advantage. 

The vote was 7 in the majority (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) and 2 in dissent (Thomas, Alito).
