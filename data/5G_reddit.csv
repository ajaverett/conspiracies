0,"One of the most important interviews on the Internet just got even more important, because of the pandemic, now the jigsaw of the plan for the future is almost complete, and the head architects are surely the Rockefeller Family.",5223.0,fs4sxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fs4sxj/one_of_the_most_important_interviews_on_the/,1180.0,1585622275.0,"First here's a brief version of the post summed up quickly:-

1. Decades ago a highly credible investigator, Norman Dodd, discovered that the tax-exempt foundations e.g. Rockefeller Foundation etc, wanted to make changes to society, and their tool of choice (at that time) was war.

2. The tax-exempt foundations said they would continue to use war until they had other effective methods for making major societal changes.

3. 10 years ago, a high-level Rockefeller document described details of other methods for influencing how the world evolves, one such scenario which was suggested in the document was a pandemic.

4. What societal changes do the Rockefellers desire? 
A former Rockefeller family friend blew the whistle on the plans the Rockefellers had for the future.  He was told they want everyone chipped for tracking and to buy/sell.  If they don't like you they will turn off your chip to make it incredibly difficult for you to function in society.

Conclusion:-  The Rockefellers no longer rely on war to make changes in the world, now they have other tools at their disposal, such as pandemics.  Their goal is take away our freedoms, then if we want them back we'll be forced to receive vaccines to gain a digital certificate of movement which allows us to be tracked on 5G control grids. Over time it will be placed onto a chip, which will be hard to avoid. By then society will be cashless, making life without a chip a struggle, almost impossible.

Chief suspects for causing this pandemic = Rockefeller family and their many proxies.

Longer version with more detail:-

[This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RgRGWlDo70) with the late [Norman Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Dodd) was already viewed as one of the most important on the Internet.  If you haven't seen it before, you really must add it to your list.  Dodd was the chief investigator of the Reece Committee, his job was to look into the tax-exempt founds e.g. Rockefeller Foundation, and to find out what they were actually up to.  In the interview he explains that the foundations are really there to make changes in the world, and that the only way they know how to make changes is through war, so their job is really to start wars.  Since war was the only effective method they knew for making major changes, they would continue to use it until they had other equivalently effective methods.  

10 years ago the [Rockefeller Foundation released a scenario document, Page 18](https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf), where they looked into different scenarios which could influence the way in which our world evolves, one of the scenarios analyzed was a pandemic.  So what we're seeing here, is that over the decades the Rockefeller Foundation has moved on, they no longer rely on war as a tool to make changes, now they have new tools at their disposal, like pandemics, making them the chief suspects as to who has placed the world into the current pandemic scenario.

Now, you may be wondering what kinds of changes the Rockefellers want to make to society, well one of their [former friends blew the whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzzBix1NdU) in a video of similar importance to the Norman Dodd interview.  Aaron Russo was a filmmaker and a close friend with one of the Rockefellers.  Aaron was told their secret plans for the world, which included everyone being micro-chipped in a cashless society, where one requires an implanted micro-chip for buying and selling.  If TPTB didn't like what you were doing they could switch off your chip, making it almost impossible for you to function in society.

So, as Bill Gates (who is allied with the Rockefellers) recently [admitted on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/), the plan is for people to have digital certificates of movement, Germany is calling them [antibody certificates](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-germany-covid-19-immunity-certificates-testing-social-distancing-lockdown-2020-3?r=US&IR=T).  It's very easy to see how these digital certificates of movement, initially on your smart phone, will eventually be installed on implanted micro-chips, in case you lose your phone and for your convenience, they will say.  You won't be allowed in society without one, as they will claim you may spread a virus, for you to be allowed out in public they will force you to have this, which also means receiving the vaccines and whatever ingredients eugenics enthusiasts Gates and the Rockefellers decide to put in them.

Last but not least, the 5G control grid which is being rapidly rolled out is there to track your movement by connecting with the digital certificate/chip, this is why 5G is being prioritized despite there being so much public resistance and unknown health risks.  While 4G was similar, it is nowhere near as fast and cannot make as many connections, with 5G they can track us in real time.

How can the Rockefellers be stopped?  

The perfect thing about their plan is that they can keep on attacking us with wave after wave of pandemic until we give in.  That means to stop them we need high level people in the world to get onboard, deciding enough is enough.  There needs to be arrests and all their essentially terrorist operations must be shut down once and for all, the Rockefellers and Mr Gates can no longer be tolerated as being above the law.",conspiracy,5G

4,"Bill Gates lets slip the real reason for the Pandemic i.e. Digital Certificate Of Movement, initially on your smart phone. Reading between the lines, this will be so as you are tracked on the 5G control grid and require compulsory vaccinations to keep your certificate valid.",1670.0,fkzyui,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fkzyui/bill_gates_lets_slip_the_real_reason_for_the/,378.0,1584575644.0,"Before we look at what he said and put it into context, here is the outline of what this is for and where it fits in:-

1. The Pandemic is initially to restrict our movement, removing our freedom.

2. To regain movement, we will require a digital certificate of movement on a smartphone (eventually on a microchip under the skin).

3. The microchip will be for buying and selling, it will be switched off if you protest TPTB.  In a cashless society you won't be able to function.

4. The 5G network is to track you, initially by your smartphone which you have to bring everywhere due to the digital certificate of movement, and eventually on your microchip.

5. End Goal - Total Enslavement, the Deep State want to own us like cattle on 5G control grids, they can switch us on and off as they wish.

Here is what [Gates said today](
https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/):-

""Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.""

The article below discusses the certificate of movement now required in France.

[Coronavirus containment: the certificate of movement on a smartphone](https://www.en24.news/a/2020/03/coronavirus-containment-the-certificate-of-movement-on-a-smartphone-practical-tip.html)

""Due to the coronavirus pandemic, France is placed in almost total containment and the population now needs a certificate to move. But not necessarily need a printer, the smartphone is enough.""

To understand the broader context of the digital certificate of movement, it's useful to go back over 10 years to an [interview with a former friend of the 'Deep State' Rockefeller family, Arron Russo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIolXnOG96g).  In the interview he exposes the plans which a member of the Rockefeller family had leaked to him in private.  One of the most important pieces of information was that in the future all humans would be required to have a microchip under their skin, and one of its main purposes would be for buying and selling.  Any individual resisting the agenda of the Deep State would have their microchip switched off, making it almost impossible for them to function in society, thereby giving The Elite immense control over the population.

Note: The Rockefeller family have also been [obsessed with pandemics](http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf) (page 18) for years [like Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDxb21qIilM).

Of course, to keep your certificate of movement valid, you'll need to keep up with your toxic social engineering vaccines, which will modify your fertility, IQ, lifespan, health etc in adverse ways, all under the guise of protecting you against various pathogens.  Both the Rockefeller's and Gates are known eugenicists, and are both heavily involved with vaccines, and both have admitted on video that they want the global population down to below one billion.

As you'll see, it is vital to resist the plans of these parasites, do not comply, if a significant % refuse to cooperate with their agenda then their agenda will fail.

TLDR - Reason for pandemic = Pretext for introduction of certificate of movement, so as we have to join vaccine social engineering program, get tracked on 5G grid and buy/sell with a microchip; fully enslaved by the Deep State.  It is essential for yourself and future generations that you refuse to comply.

11,Path of the Great Reset: what they don't tell you about the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus and the infamous global vaccine campaign.,1174.0,ovknhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ovknhw/path_of_the_great_reset_what_they_dont_tell_you/,916.0,1627787687.0,"https://preview.redd.it/1mkctfnyvne71.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c1f6af0d4466077ad45f3707781993b2b92a808

The fundamental issue with the global mRNA and DNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) and Covid-19 (the disease) is that these vaccines **permanently alter a person’s DNA**, referred to as the ‘host DNA’.

The primary mechanism leading to changes in the host DNA is the presence within both the virus and the vaccines of genetic materials incorporated from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus).^(1)

The secondary ""double-tap"" mechanism resulting in changes to the host DNA is a process called reverse transcription,^(4) which occurs in stem cells. Stem cells develop into many different types of cells in the body. In the case of reverse transcription, the stem cells are genetically modified, replicate, and amplify to a large portion of cells that make up the tissues of the body. Stem cells serve as a reservoir to produce new cells in a perpetual fashion. In this way, over time, a large percentage of our somatic (non-reproductive) cells can be replaced by these genetically modified stem-cell precursor cells.^(2)

This process carries over into the reproductive system of the individual and results in the transfer of genetic modification to the germline cells (egg and sperm). This insertional genetic mutation would find itself in all future generations stemming from this individual(s). Because this is a germline modification and not a somatic modification, this new genetic element will be present in every single cell of these individuals, wholly changing their body's genome.^(2)

**The Coronavirus pandemic is the excuse to vaccinate all with the mark of the Great Reset.** The coronavirus is behaving as all Lentiviruses do, and that is to alter the host's DNA, enabling the virus to go on and infect other healthy cells. The level of changes in the DNA as a result of having been vaccinated is quite different than that of the virus due to the additional technological components included within them. Additionally, the actual re-arrangement of genes in a new sequence is more extensive than the pattern altered by the viral genes themselves.

https://preview.redd.it/t9785sy6xne71.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fc811ceee79b60fc500974efd749f220eaa41d9

According to Nobel prize laurate Dr. Luc Montagnier (the discoverer of HIV) and other researchers, there are 16 genetic fragments of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV contained within the overall genomic sequence of the Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.^(1) This sequence, a series of genes, is known as mRNA or ‘messenger’ RNA. These same genetic fragments are also present within vaccines employing mRNA such as Pfizer and Moderna. While Johnson & Johnson utilizes DNA in a viral vector vaccine as do other companies such as AstraZeneca, this viral mRNA is still present along with those 16 genetic fragments.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a Lentivirus, a subgroup of retroviruses that cause chronic and deadly diseases characterized by long incubation periods. Lentiviruses integrate viral DNA into the DNA of a host cell, permanently altering it and the descendants of the host. A retrovirus is a type of virus that inserts a copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus permanently changing the genome of that cell.

There is yet another mechanism at work in the alteration of the host DNA by HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. There is a third strand of DNA referred to as a ""central DNA flap"" that ensures the integration of the viral DNA.^(3) Due to the presence of the genetic fragments of HIV, this DNA flap is found in not only the virus SARS-CoV-2, but also within the mRNA and DNA-based vaccines.

Vaccines have typically been derived by utilizing the virus to stimulate the production of antibodies by the individual's immune system in order to provide immunity without inducing the disease. However in the current mRNA and viral vector vaccines, the genetic materials of the virus enter your cells and give them instructions to create Spike proteins, which triggers the production of antibodies which fight off the virus and form immunity against it. Thus, the concern here is in regard to the 16 genetic fragments of the Lentivirus HIV, a retrovirus, which are present in all gene-based vaccines for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. Both this virus and its vaccines permanently alter the DNA of a person, resulting in a specifically altered genome signature that can be universally detected (and biometrically confirmed) in all currently vaccinated individuals. More on that below.

[This infographic illustrates the HIV replication cycle, which begins when HIV fuses with the surface of the host cell. A capsid containing the virus’s genome and proteins then enters the cell. The shell of the capsid disintegrates and the HIV protein called reverse transcriptase transcribes the viral RNA into DNA. The viral DNA is transported across the nucleus, where the HIV Integrase protein integrates the HIV DNA into the host’s DNA. The host’s normal transcription machinery transcribes HIV DNA into multiple copies of new HIV RNA. Some of this RNA becomes the genome of a new virus, while the cell uses other copies of the RNA to make new HIV proteins. The new viral RNA and HIV proteins move to the surface of the cell, where a new, immature HIV forms. Finally, the virus is released from the cell, and the HIV protein called protease cleaves newly synthesized polyproteins to create a mature infectious virus. https:\/\/www.niaid.nih.gov\/diseases-conditions\/hiv-replication-cycle](https://preview.redd.it/x0ixmvt0wne71.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93d17648690ce70af6d98ca4bc361e1f3877458e)

The world is currently undergoing a Great Reset and the rabid global vaccination campaign constitutes the distribution of the biblical ""Mark of the Beast"" (Revelation 13:6,17,18 and 14:9-11).

In combination with the genetic alterations induced by this virus and its vaccines, **the vaccines themselves contain components marking, or indicating the DNA has undergone these changes**. There are several aspects to the mark, including both biological and spiritual.

Briefly, the merging of the biological with the technological. In addition to the genetic materials previously cited, the vaccines were developed with the aid of a firefly enzyme known as Luciferase, which is not present in the current vaccines but will be present in the next vaccines which are arriving very imminently (more on that later). Luciferase is a fluorescent material not visible to the naked eye, but is visible using computer applications and scanning devices. Already contained within the current vaccines is a type of highly absorbent gel known as hydrogel, made up of large molecules known as polymers. Hydrogel is used to carry genetic materials, Luciferase enzymes, and other components making up the vaccines. Some of these hydrogel components are referred to as nanobots, which are molecular composites that can be programmed to carry out a specific task. The nucleic acids of DNA naturally self-assemble and this ability is used to design, and through genetic modification, program them. Nanobots are used to carry drugs and molecular payloads to specific targets within the body. Other nanobots function as biological sensors, collecting information from within the body and are capable of transmitting this digital information outside of the body. Lastly on the nanoscale, which is measured in billionths of a meter, are quantum dots, also referred to as artificial atoms. These are actual semiconductors with both optical and electronic properties. Similar to Luciferase, quantum dots also emit visible light. These have also been referred to as quantum dot tattoos.

[The Starlink satellite array is covering the entire Earth.](https://preview.redd.it/orbfwwoawne71.png?width=3367&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d42fc8c1f2ac1ce158b9ff65973ce133f6e2bf30)

Along with the DNA altering payload that is present within the current vaccines, the aforementioned technologies for biometric identification will soon be swiftly implemented onto the world in the next vaccines. These will feature the quantum dots, which have yet to be activated and will be by their receiving an electromagnetic signal transmitted through the current 5th Generation wireless systems in tandem with the inaugural worldwide Starlink satellite array. **Soon, the hypodermic needle and syringe used to inject vaccines will be replaced by a microneedle array patch, much like an adhesive bandage**. In this way, the vaccines will not require refrigeration, and can be applied by most anyone to themselves. In fact, they can be shipped, mailed and delivered to nearly everyone. As the name implies, the patch contains a group of small needles that when pushed against the skin feel similar to Velcro, with little to no pain. These needles then dissolve leaving only their tips embedded beneath the surface, delivering their cargo to be absorbed into and distributed through the bloodstream to every cell in the body.

When taken together at the final phase of this global campaign, the quantum dots and Luciferase manifest as a tattoo just beneath the surface of the skin after being applied with the imminent microneedle array patch. **As such, a device will be required to see these and detect the presence of this biometric mark anywhere on the body, namely the right arm or hand**. Smartphones equipped with technology to detect these materials already exist. When described in Revelation 13:6, the mark is received in the right hand or forehead, and this can be interpreted as locations of convenience for scanning and detecting the presence of the mark. This will be similar in fashion to the present use of a digital thermometer applied to the forehead in checking for an elevated body temperature.

Kennedy Jr, leader of the Health Freedom Movement and chairman of the Children’s Health Defense, wrote an article about Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai; about Ayyadurai's connections to Big Pharma, Big Data/Telecom, Vaccine Makers, Bill Gates, the Clintons and his general lack of integrity.",1042.0,ga79n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ga79n9/yesterday_robert_f_kennedy_jr_leader_of_the/,143.0,1588157506.0,"**[Critical Questions for Dr. Shiva About His Attempts to Splinter the Health Freedom Movement](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/critical-questions-for-dr-shiva-about-his-attempts-to-splinter-the-health-freedom-movement/)**


**By Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Chairman, Children’s Health Defense**

APRIL 28, 2020

For many months I have remained silent in the face of defamatory and dishonest attacks against me by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai. My approach was to ignore the sniping to preserve the unity of the Health Freedom Movement. However, Shiva has expanded his malevolent campaign to include venomous salvos against our community’s most prominent and effective leaders, including Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Dr. Rashid Buttar, Polly Tommey and Samoan-Australian activist Taylor Winterstein. Because he now has some of our outstanding spokesmen in his gun-sites, and because his poisonous volleys have begun to damage the solidarity that is critical to our success, I reluctantly make this response.

**Little Lies / Big Lies**

I had never heard of Shiva when he approached me on the street following a January 6th, 2020 Trenton rally. We had a friendly chat and took a photo. [Afterward, he tweeted that I had refused to shake his hand.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Handshake-tweet-e1588101235385.jpg) [A half-dozen photos](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0706-scaled-e1588018251484.jpeg) of [us shaking hands](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7134-e1588101646604.jpg) soon surfaced, proving his statements false. It was only then that I learned he was running as a fringe candidate for U.S. Senate against my nephew, Massachusetts Congressman Joseph Kennedy. It is axiomatic that a man who lies about small things, will also lie about the large. I made a note to fact check Shiva’s assertions. I advise others to take similar precautions.

**Attacking Our Leaders**

Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Polly Tommey and Dr. Rashid Buttar are battle proven veterans deeply scarred by incalculable personal sacrifices suffered on the front-line trenches during decades of hand to hand combat against Pharma, corrupt regulators and the medical cartel. They have published, litigated, campaigned, debated, testified, strategized, organized, informed, and defended. I am proud to have served with each of them in dozens of state capitals, speaking at rallies, testifying before state legislatures, and meeting with public officials. They have emptied their personal bank accounts and, at times, ruined their health in service to our cause. They have each played indispensable roles in building the institutions that have helped us coalesce into the coherent and powerful movement that now threatens the Pharmaceutical paradigm. They have given us every reason to trust them and no reason for doubt. Shiva’s claim that these individuals are “controlled opposition” are patently absurd.

**Undermining State Health Freedom Advocates**

Shiva has viciously attacked the brilliant Health Choice Massachusetts (HCM) organizer, Candice Edwards. Edwards and her HCM co-founder, Allison Chapman lead the battle to derail the repeal of vaccine exemptions in Boston. Shiva tried to sabotage the group’s efforts, by showing up at Legislature Hearings without the science panel he had promised and delivering self-promotional testimony so loaded with insulting vulgarity and invective, that the Public Health Committee shut down the hearing, calling Shiva “a prick.” [Shiva then picked a loud fight with one of the moms accusing her of using her child for political purposes.](https://youtu.be/XWO_anzCOp8) “He threw us under the bus,” Edwards recalls. Shiva accuses Edwards of being “controlled opposition.”

**When Shiva calls Movement leaders “controlled opposition,” is he speaking of himself?**

Instead of preaching science, Shiva spends money from his Health Freedom donor base digging up dirt on other activists. Shiva employs a full-time “Negative Research” investigator, Jennifer Bennett, to excavate and invent defamatory gossip about Health Freedom Groups and their leaders in Massachusetts and nationally. In his war against our Movement, Shiva employs all the classic strategies and gambits prescribed by psychological warfare experts, in our Intelligence Services, for disrupting social reform movements when they begin to gather steam and threaten the power of entrenched vested interests.

So why, beside malignant narcissism, would a newcomer to our Movement seek to undermine our most effective and influential leaders and divide our forces? I don’t like to speculate about people’s motives, but it is a common motif among a certain species of scoundrel to project their own villainy in their slandering of others. Do Shiva’s accusations that all of us are “controlled opposition” reveal his own motivations?

Some hints to that answer may lie among the things Shiva doesn’t tell us.

**Shiva, the Vaccine Maker**

Shiva never mentions the fact that he is a vaccine maker. Shiva owns a pharmaceutical company, [Cytosolve](https://cytosolve.com/pharmaceuticals/), that [partners with vaccine and drugmakers to accelerate FDA approvals for vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve2.jpeg). His principal [business partner](https://cytosolve.com/about-us/) is [Pfizer](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-27-20-at-5.57-PM.jpg), the world’s #4 vaccine maker. Are Shiva’s attacks on our Movement calculated pandering, to court affection from Pfizer and the HHS regulators––upon whose favor his financial success relies––and to win their blessings by discrediting a Movement that questions vaccine products?

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1961.jpeg

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve4.jpeg

**Shiva’s business model requires him to court favor with vaccine companies.**

**Shiva made his money from the Clintons**

Shiva claims to have invented Email ([Smithsonian](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/va-shivaayyadurai-inventor-of-e-mail-honored-by-smithsonian/2012/02/17/gIQA8gQhKR_story.html) says Shiva’s claim is untrue and a Federal court has agreed). In fact, Shiva made his fortune [running Email operations](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) for President Bill and Hillary Clinton during the White House years. (It is ironic, therefore, that he accuses others of consorting with the Clintons). The Clinton contract propelled his company, [EchoMail](https://echomail.com/about-us/), to a [$200 million](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) [valuation.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-28-20-at-11.26-AM.jpg)

**Shiva, Partner to Microsoft**

Shiva’s [Echomail](https://echomail.com/about-us/) partner was [Bill Gates’ Microsoft](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588022140928.jpg). Even today, Shiva lists Microsoft as his partner on his EchoMail homepage. Gates, the world’s most prominent and vocal advocate for universal mandatory vaccination is also a proponent for tagging human beings with injected technologies for tracking vaccine records. Both Microsoft and Gates are leading industry efforts to develop a subdermal biometric chip system. Shiva’s success at dividing our movement and undermining and discrediting our leadership might ingratiate him with these business partners.

**Shiva and Bill Gates**

It is noteworthy that Shiva consistently mutes his criticism of [Bill Gates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/01-03-Bill-Gates-with-Vaccine_Email-e1588022386170.jpg), seeking to deflect public anger at Gates towards Hillary Clinton. This makes no sense. Hillary’s views on mandatory vaccines are abhorrent, but unlike Gates whose ownership of the WHO and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance allows him to dictate global vaccine policy, Hillary is an out-of-work politician with no political power. The Clinton Foundation is virtually defunct and bootless as an arbiter of public health policy. Why does Shiva shield Gates and insist that Hillary is the more important target?

**Shiva and 5G**

Both Gates and Microsoft hold leading stakes in the burgeoning wireless infrastructure expansion. Gates’ subdermal chip systems will be capable of meshing with Gates’ extensive new 5G antennae and satellite deployments, to harvest, not only our vaccination and medical data, but also lucrative information about our movements, our purchases, and our desires, at the granular level. [Shiva lists his other business partners as the principle Big Data Titans](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588084452529.jpg), Dell, Oracle and IBM which all stand to make a killing on the current 5G expansion. Is this why Shiva refuses to condemn 5G?

**How Does Shiva Escape Censorship?**

Shiva is the only leader in our Movement [who doesn’t suffer the Social Media censorship that bedevils the rest of us](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Both-IG2.jpg). His capacity to boost his audience, his immunity from shadow-banning and from eviction from his platforms has allowed him to exponentially expand his base, as the rest of us struggle past the censors to reach our audiences, one follower at a time. Why are Facebook, Google, and Instagram showering love on Shiva while they strangle the rest of us? Why does Silicon Valley boost Shiva and smother us?

**Shilling for Silicon Valley Big Data Billionaires**

Shiva has previous experience shilling for Big Data/Telecom. In 2010, Shiva served as front man to PayPal’s Silicon Valley titan, Peter Thiel. Thiel was campaigning to destroy Gawker in revenge for its unflattering article about himself. Thiel funded Shiva to file a defamation law suit against Gawker for reporting that Shiva lied about inventing Email. Shiva, of course, lost the law suit, but the ruinous costs of the litigation helped bankrupt Gawker, which was always Thiel’s purpose. Shiva may have discovered, from that transaction, the economic opportunities in shilling for Silicon Valley’s Big Data Barrons.

Silicon Valley is deeply entrenched with the CIA and the Pentagon in cyber-warfare efforts and in developing AI surveillance systems that can compete with the Chinese. The Silicon Valley/CIA partnership has its own secretive Federal agency, the National Security Commission, chaired by ex Google CEO, Eric Schmidt. Their strategy is to roll out 5G as a comprehensive security and surveillance superstructure that will serve as a platform for new surveillance technologies. This sinister cabal undoubtedly see the evolving Health Freedom coalition between anti 5G and anti Pharma activists as an obstacle to their ambitions.

Why Does Shiva Want to Push Democrats Out of the Health Freedom Movement?
Shiva’s insistence that Democrats disown their party, before being welcomed into the Health Freedom Movement, and his attacks on anyone who ever voted for Hillary or any other prominent Democrat, seem deliberately calculated to foment destructive partisanship and to drive Democrats from our Movement. Shiva knows that for us to succeed, our Movement requires political diversity, unity, harmony and a big tent. We welcome citizens of every nation and every political stripe. We don’t impose ideological tests or check party affiliations. I, myself, am a lifelong Democrat, but I understand that this issue must transcend party affiliations. All of our best leaders comprehend that there is no such thing as a Republican child or a Democratic child. I have worked effectively and aggressively across the nation, with Republicans—[including President Trump](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-2.04-PM-e1588023232147.jpg). Trump, who himself donated $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, did not hold my previous support for Hillary against me. He welcomed the opportunity to burnish the project’s bipartisan bona fides.

Our bipartisan approach is effective, and frightening to Pharma. Is this why Shiva is trying so hard to excite political hatred among our followers, and to polarize us along party lines?

**Can Shiva Pass his Own Ideological Test?**

Shiva’s insistence on ideological purity is ironic at best and duplicitous and deceptive at worst, given his own ambiguous political theologies. To win the top spot on the G.O.P.’s U.S. Senate ballot, Shiva persuaded Massachusetts Republicans that he was a staunch, dyed-in-the-wool Right-wing Trump supporter. [Elsewhere, however,](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.43-PM-e1588024885644.jpg) [he brags of being a committed socialist and communist sympathizer.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.42-PM.jpg) His wavering affiliations beg the question: Who is Shiva, and does he stand for anything beyond personal opportunism?

**Psy-Ops Tactics**

Shiva does not litigate, publish or fund scientific research, build institutions, treat patients, or collaborate with other leaders. He has demonstrated no inclination to work with the rest of us to build a Movement, powerful enough to confront the Big Pharma and the Big Data/Telecom tyrants. He behaves, in every instance, like a man determined to tear down all that others have built up. People who still believe in Shiva might demand to know why he chooses to spare FDA, Pfizer, Microsoft, and 5G his barbs, and to direct his poison instead at our proven leaders. Shiva seems intent on distracting Del, Mark, Rashid, Polly, Taylor, Candice and others from their important work. His sinister, treacherous and destructive rear guard action, fomenting and feeding schism, division, discord, and confusion that harms our Movement, plays directly into the hands of Big Pharma.

It was like a pole shift, going from curious but quite skeptical, to the bottom of the rabbit hole, almost immediately.


The two links that got me “woke” were the late David McGowans “Pedophocracy”, and then “The Greenbaum Speech” given by esteemed psychologist Dr. Corydon Hammond. Together these two links show beyond a shadow of a doubt that there exists an evil cult presence, as a shadow control system, behind the world stage… and they are pulling the puppet strings.


http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html


https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon03.htm


(Interestingly, my ‘pole shift’ came on December 21, 2012. There was definitely an energetic shift that day.)


Since then I've learned about Building 7, the documents proving MKUltra was a success, NATOs false flag terrorism campaign, FBI assassinations and psyops, Direct Energy Weapons, ELF weapons and gangstalking, HAARP and the dangers of 5g, the CIA owning tbe globa drug trade, Project Monarch and the sleeper army of trauma-based mind control victims…


The list goes on. 


The main thing that stuck out to me were all the “occult” aspects that surround the most serious conspiracies. The CIA wants to entrap pedo politicians, so they get involved in the child trafficking trade. Ok, makes sense from their psychopathic perspective. But they don't stop there, they use and abuse these children in black magick rituals while they're at it. Hollywood isn't just trying to corrupt and dumb down our culture, it's being done with the help of symbols and symbolism. D.C. city layout is full of these Masonic symbols, for an example of how embedded they are.


It's a clue that we have to look deeper, rather than assuming that the state of our world is due to individual greed and human nature.


There is a shadow network, a web of evidence wrapped around our reality, sustaining itself by feeding off us and the planet.


And thanks to some brave souls we've been able to lift the Veil for a few moments on this cabal, this group of “psychopathic others” who do black magick rituals to hypnotize society, and to plant their symbolism charged with hate and fear into the media, so that they rearrange our subconscious structure as we mindlessly consume.


Troy Boner's recounting of watching his friend get his brains blown out while tied up and naked in the forests of Bohemian Grove, Cathy O'Brien's tales of having Dissociative Identity Disorder implanted in her during ritual abuse and then being a slave for Washington ‘elite’, the victims of the McMartin Preschool ritual abuse who still claim to this day that the abuse was real and that the media covered it up, these are the stories that act as a window into their dark world, and these are also the stories with which they taunt us, knowing that the majority could never accept the truth even if it came from the programming box… they would just kill the messenger.


When all the pieces of the puzzle are put together, the picture is clear.


There is a self-replicating who reproduces itself through ritual abuse and trauma-based mind control of it's followers, hiding in plain sight, controlling the shadow governments of most of the world, with their army of mind controlled slaves.


The goal of this conscious evil is to perpetually deceive and enslave us. As past civilizations and epochs have risen and fallen, so too has this evil, but unlike the empires it consumes, there is no death, only rest.


But this isnt quite the bottom of the rabbit hole. 


The ultimate conspiracy is what these facts about the nature of evil, speak of in regards to the nature of us.


The ultimate deception was.making us forget *who we are*.


We are equally deceived by the state of the world as we are by the structure of our reality.


An atom is 99.99999…% space. We are Light, vibrating at an intense rate, we are waves and fields, not chunks of fleshy matter. Our energetic body has it's structure based in DNA and just like the physical, it has veins and arteries, detoxing and motors.


And we are powerful. We are powerful spiritual beings capable of manifesting our own realities.


If you haven't already, start looking for synchronicities. Whether a number follows you around and gains spiritual significance, or you analyze tbhe geometry of the flow of your life to see how each event has been meaningful to your growth, or notice how your external reality seems tl have a correspondence with your thoughts.


These synchronicities are intentional, though not by the conscious self. They are evidence of a bridge between mind and matter, a reminder that reality is not just a bunch of cold rocks and hot gasses… a reminder that we have the ability to control our own realities.


We can co-create such beautiful paradises together based in Love and respect, if we nurture the power of creation that lies within each of us.


We can direct our spiritual and mental evolution, and the capacity to create.increasingly beautiful and profound realities to experience, is limitless.


This physical dimension is nothing compared to the power of Infinity that lies within each of us.


To the evil shadow cabal, this is the truth they are most trying to suppress. Any other conspiracy could get exposed and they wouldn't mind too much. Because evil can thrive in chaos. But not in Love.


This is why they have manipulated to progression of society to be so absorbed in our propaganda machines, obedient to the concept of external authority, mindlessly consuming what is new and popular. They need the programming and distractions to be so complete that the masses will not even consider an idea, will reject it completely without analyzing it, if it does not work within a predetermined spectrum of thought.


This way, they not only control what we think, but what we manifest.


It seems that in many apsects of this plan they are quite successful.


This is why they repeatedly shock humanity with false flag tragedy, to keep us in fear, because from fear evil can manifest.


The best way to shine a light on this conspiracy is to discover your true self, your personal truth, and to live it without fear, moment to moment manifesting your perfect reality. Shine bright and be bold, as a signal to others that it is possible to do, possible to live free instead of as a product or asset. That it is possible to Love in this sick world.


Meditation is key to anchoring yourself to what exists beyond this illusion, this false matrix unfairly imposed over our planet, which we are being tricked into maintaining.


We're all stuck in this web but we can get unstuck, whether you peel it off slowly or rip it off with the hairs still attached, if we collectively desire true freedom and work towards it, with all out effort, based in Love, then we will eventually achieve it.


Because that is who we are, powerful spiritual beings, and that is what we do when we are awake, we manifest our dreams.


Love vibes,


Timothy 🦁🦁🦁

&nbsp;

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 and December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China and with potential to destablize and perhaps even motive to collapse China from within.

&nbsp;

US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage vs China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and the BRI relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible denialability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermnonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blow back. 

&nbsp;

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping XI/CCP would kowtow to etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""new american century"") the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives  and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worse possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.  

&nbsp;

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devasting is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people. 

&nbsp;

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host Steve Bannon (Trump chief campaign advisor) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the Xi/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

&nbsp;

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasin population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantinee and lockdowns of cities of unprecendeted porportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damaage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

&nbsp;

Even the SARS of 2003 had an negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and has already turned out to be far worse and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsuprisingly without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilsts at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak. 

&nbsp;

China should at least stay vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends.. Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and pysops war, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened.

&nbsp;

Steve Bannon was hoping to ""break the back of the CCP"" by cutting off China's supply chain, and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change.

&nbsp;

I'm sure both China and US have their own red lines. If the US had any involvement in this new virus, if China finds any credible evidence, then there are a number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon... for example, we all know the Trade War is not about trade, but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise... for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS, making a move that would seal the US fate as the ""falling empire"". If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region, so China can declare ADIZ over SCS, America would be pushed back to Guam, and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony (which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster)

&nbsp;

Some have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles. And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill/contain. But I believe in this case it is about maintaining ""plausible deniability"" whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future. A virus outbreak that dings China's GDP by 2 to 5 % in 2020 is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out 90% of the Chinese population, for example. Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China's central Wuhan, naturally China has a self interest in containment, and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China. It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it. Hence ""mission accomplished"" with little attribution and minimal blowback. What better way to undermine China/CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government!? Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn't for eating rats, bats, dogs, etc this wouldn't ever have befallen. Perfect cover for re-enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China, and that of Chinese culture, and Chinese ideology on the world stage.

&nbsp;

All of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides's Trap. For various reason, biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages, hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China. At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans? History has shown that America is willing to wipe out entire Han civilization to maintain american hegemony and regain full spectrum dominance and supremacy.

&nbsp;

Kissinger is credited for giving Nixon the idea to open up China. It appears as the 45 year rapprochement comes to a sudden close, the US has regretted the long term decision. When viewed threw the lens of optimization of entropy maximization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics it is all about the counterbalance needed to an unchallenged US uni-polar scheme that impedes the progress and destiny of a universe in evolution.

&nbsp;

Steve Bannon was quoted to say that it is Ten times more important for the US to kill Huawei than it is for Trump to sign any trade deal. USA realizes that China will soon surpass them if status quo isn't changed. The true motive of the trade war is to decouple the US from China quickly enough to asymmetrically target and destroy any tip of the spear Chinese companies/projects/tech such as the Huawei, 5G, DJI, EV, trains, Cancer research, TikTok, SenseTime, etc etc to cripple China's plans to move up the value chain and hi-tech-ify its economy and to do so with enough force to set back China and permanently prevent it from successfully climbing the arch trajectory of replacing the US. For the US it’s not just about losing the top spot to China, if America were to ever lose its petrodollar hegemony it would collapse in much the same way as happened to the USSR. The whole US empire is built on house of cards, ever since Brentwood they got away with taxing/usurping the world using the dollar as economic weaponization through 'quantitative easing' and its military to control OPEC to sustain the petrodollar hegemony. In the 1980's Japan became a threat to the US so they forced Tokyo to acquiesce to the Plaza Accord resulting in the ""lost four decades"" and Japan never recovering. Nowadays Trump, Steve Bannon, Pompeo and other Hawks are trying to impose the same sort of colonization on China, but much harder to do since China doesn't entertain US troops/US bases unlike the Japanese vassal so the next best thing is to subvert Hong Kong by way of CIA/NED and other propaganda techniques. And which nation killed a million civilians in Iraq after a false flag event and a WMD pretext but now is banning Chinese AI startups ostensibly because they care about the human rights of Muslims in China's internal Xinjiang region?

&nbsp;

This is all part of the bigger picture to contain China's continued rise, as we see that if the US ever lost its hegemony it would be game over... America views Chinese ambitions such as Made In China 2025, One Belt One Road, 5G, AI, etc as existential threats to its very lifestyle and way of life, hence the whole ""Huawei is a national security issue"" stance... Now even TikTok, a dancing video app, has become a ""national security"" threat and targeted and singled out by the US Congress. By ""national security"" they really mean China is offering the world a better deal and they are pissed that they are being undercut and view Chinese success as a direct threat to American hegemony. The West had its chance to help out Africa but did nothing, now China wants to help them develop and US is getting resentful, the supreme irony is accusing China of predatory lending. This will only get much worse, Xi predicted this will last a period of 30 years until which time China has become the undisputed Number One in the world economically, technologically, politically and militaristically. As the declining power the US isn’t going to just go down without fighting..... Just like the Roma Empire, as the US declines on the way down the lip service of freedom, democracy, etc stops and the true colors of the ugly side all comes out, they just did another coup in Bolivia after China signed a lithium deal to secure development of batteries for EVs, and now US is even sanctioning its own ""allies"" like Germany for daring to buy energy from Russia (NordStream 2, etc)...

&nbsp;

Like others have already brought to light and mentioned, with the multiple initial sources surrounding this Wuhan virus, it makes ""intentionally starting a pandemic with a bioweapon"" scenario much more likely. The virus failed to spread with the first group of targets, so they tried again with the market.

&nbsp;

For those who refuse to believe the US could ever be morally capable of doing such a coordinated strike and biological attack on mainland China, even if you do not at all believe US had anything to do with it, and even if US in reality had nothing to do with it, it still doesn't change the fact that this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance; and we already have evidence from US such as Wilber Ross etc willing to take full advantage of the situation. China must be prepared to adapt and adjust to this fluid situation as well, short term and as well as long term. This thing could very well politically isolate China (it is already having such an effect) and crater China's GDP, and most importantly strategically pressure China to give up its long term development aspirations and also to sign away certain concessions (give up on MIC2025 etc) right at the most critical moment in history.

&nbsp;

Sure we understand that the flu killed already 10000 US person this year alone, I also know the numbers in terms of how many up to 80,000 die of flu alone last year. And yes some of the hysteria and panic of this Wuhan thing may cause more damage than good at this point, sometimes the fear is more than just the virus damage itself.

&nbsp;

Having said that, on the other hand, the facts are this banning of all flights from China to the US, the enactment of the quarantine is described by the US CDC itself as the heaviest action it has taken in 50 years. Indeed when was the last time Russia closed its borders to China? When was the last time Disney shutdown, and all these hundreds of other things shutting down in China and all the countries closing their door to China? Precisely my point regardless of whether or not the real or percieved threat of this virus is overblown or not, the fact is the reaction to it has already greatly harmed China substantitively at what could be argued as the worst possible timing... so yes, this virus has changed the power dynamic and upset the balance.

&nbsp;

The fact of the matter is the rest of the world isn't closing its flights and borders to the USA, despite the flu in the US killing way more people, but the world is closing its doors to China... This cannot be good no matter how it is spun. I'm concerned this will be the point of inflection in which the tide permanently turns and China regresses back to being closed, isolated country and America pulled the supply chain rung under China's feet while China is down/ill and then convinences the rest of the world to a new Brentwoods to basically maintain US hegemony for the next 100 years. Perhaps this is what Trump was secretly hinting at when he gleefully announced at Davos that ""now is the time for renewed and great optimism""... Maybe he was hinting at world events to come that will greatly benefit America at the direct expense of China, events that by the time he made the speech at Davos would have already been put in place by the CIA. 

&nbsp;

If America has declared war on China, --(first by economic decoupling via sanctions and tariffs then by trying to kill off Chinese technology ascension by attempting to cut off China's tech supply chain, and finally by covert biowarfare to destroy China's food supply and then poision the Chinese people with a sinister virus in hopes of destablizing the entire country,)-- etc and by all appearances it has, with Pompeo openly stating that the Chinese CCP was the ""central threat of our times"", and Bannon calling for Trump to ""takedown Xi"" and ""break the spirit and crack the back of the Chinese people"", then it behooves China to defend itself and its citizens and interests appropriately. 

&nbsp;

This information better be spread across Chinese media so that the average Chinese develops a healthy and warranted suspicion of certain nations that have taken it upon themselves to stop at nothing to destroy the Chinese way of life and to destroy China's development and progress. Making more mainland Chinese aware of the underlining truth that all of China is constantly being targeted with warfare of all categories and at all levels by everything American cannot possibly be a bad thing. America has been applying every kind of means of warfare that exists under the sun against China, against the Chinese government and against the Chinese people and their well-being; be it Trade War, Economic War, Proxy War (Taiwan, HK, etc), Tech War (Huawei/5G/AI/tiktok), Supply Chain War, CyberWar, Information propaganda Warfare (including the ""reverse conspiracy theory"" and other false flags), Biological Warfare and soon to be Conventional war and perhaps even someday Nuclear war. 

&nbsp;

The Chinese people for their own good should be more aware of the ideological war that America has inflicted upon the Chinese citizens both at home and abroad... The stark constrasting juxposition could not be more supremely ironic and hypocritical. Brain drain from the rest of the nations in the world to the US is called ""free market"" and labeled as ""freedom loving scientists going to work in open democractic Universities with higher pay and better quality of life"" and yet this same notion of ""brain drain"" from the US to the rest of the world is called ""intellectual property theft"", ""spying"", or ""sending spies to steal 'American technology'"". For when as China or Russia or India jailed their scientists for working with US universities and earning US research grants. If they did that, immediately the US media will instantly accuse them of being ""totalitarian communist police state with no academic freedom"" etc.

&nbsp;

During China's moment of greatest need and vulnerability we see Westerners racism and xenophobia come out in full blossom from Universities that say it is normal to be xenophobia to so-called ""free speech"" newspapers that take delight in China's plight and openly incite hatred and racisms by publishing intentionally vile depictions of the Chinese people and the Chinese flag in order to kick China while it is down. 

&nbsp;

America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

**The end.**

After I promised to post it, he sent me one final message to underline and summarize everything said:

Motive, means, and TIMING, all just too suspicious... in terms of the African Swine Flu that started attacking chinese pigs for the VERY FIRST TIME immediately after Trump started the Trade war in 2018 causing China to buy MORE Pork from the US at higher price/cost!

Then immediately after China signs the ""trade deal phase 1"" this wuhan virus happens, and US already saying they will bring jobs back and push china harder on phase 2!!!!

Then, on top of everything, bird flu happens in china too, and now chickens are going dead!

The timing is just too suspect, how come India and bunch of other dirty countries that eat bats and whatever never had outbreak?

Then they found out this virus only targets Chinese DNA!

////

""We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.""
""The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung.”

This made me suspicious. Why is the MSM so aggresive when it comes to 5G? And why are they so quick to say that 5G radiation is completely harmless?

As 5G poles were being deployed everywhere around the world in 2018-2019, more and more people started questioning it's effects on the enviroment. Then in 2020 the media created a false conspiracy theory: they started writting articles claiming people are saying that 5G started the coronavirus pandemic to make questioners look completely crazy. This was done to both shut them up as well as to make other people laugh at them: ([example 1](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-53285610), [example 2](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/24/21231085/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-covid-facebook-youtube), [example 3](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/14/tech/5g-health-conspiracy-debunked/index.html), [example 4](https://www.bbc.com/news/53191523), [example 5](https://www.wired.com/story/the-rise-and-spread-of-a-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory/)).

In reality, nobody said that 5G caused the pandemic, but people who control the MSM can easily control the perception of the masses by creating false stories. And they did. Obviously, 5G has nothing to do with the virus but my post is about analyzing the direct effects of 5G on the environment(trees,plants,animals,humans).

So let me ask you the following questions:


1. [If 5G radiation is harmless, why do these bees die under 5G poles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5IhKHGDKhM&feature=emb_logo)

2. [If 5G radiation is harmless, why does it destroy trees?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEIxpCgEZM)

3. [If 5G radiation is harmless, why do these birds die when they're flying close to 5G poles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvK2ADrEZXw)

4. [**Now explain to me why should we ignore these scientists from 42 different countries** who are warning their governments about the health risks associated with 5G radiation?](https://streamable.com/4e9g6q)

**Operation Earnest Voice**

Operation Earnest Voice (OEV) is a communications program by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.

Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:

Fifty user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.

Sockpuppets are to be ""replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent."" Sockpuppets are to ""be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.""

A special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from ""randomly selected IP addresses,"" in order to ""hide the existence of the operation.""

Fifty static IP addresses to enable government agencies to ""manage their persistent online personas,"" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to ""look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.""

Nine private servers, ""based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from."" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.

Virtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with ""any virus, worm, or malicious software.""

Whether blatantly visible or not, you can identify just about any network by connecting dots between individuals and organizations. Who’s working with whom, where, and why? Who’s paying whom? And once you’ve done that, you can more clearly identify the motivations behind various decisions

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation appears to be near the top, or the center, of this COVID plandemic network. Gates is also a major funder of mainstream media, and his network extends into global food and climate change policy

The Gates Foundation, through its funding of the WEF, also plays an important role in The Great Reset, which was officially unveiled during a WEF summit in May 2020

Every conceivable aspect of life and society is scheduled to be “reset” according to their plan. Ultimately, that’s where this criminal COVID enterprise is trying to take us.

Those people are now trying to reshape the world via the CV-19 fear-based agenda in order to gain more power and control for themselves and bring about an AI-controlled dystopian future that benefits them even more greatly. Ignore it at your own peril. They call it The Great Reset. It involves travel restrictions, tracking, tracing, mandatory vaccination, monitoring, surveillance, digital currency, 5G to implement the global control, etc. Its all right there on their own website... plain as day. They aren't even hiding it from the public anymore.

Amendments to legislation have affected USAGM's governing authorities and organizational structure by shifting authority from a bipartisan board to a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with advice from an Advisory Board. Network and USAGM officials said that previous members of USAGM leadership took several actions that did not align with USAGM's firewall principles. According to USAGM, the firewall protecting the networks' independence is central to the credibility and effectiveness of USAGM's networks (see fig.). However, the parameters of the firewall are not specifically laid out in legislation. Delineation of what is and is not permissible under the firewall may help ensure the professional independence and integrity of the agency and its networks.

Actions to ensure accountability of grantees, such as establishing Standard Operating Procedures for Monitoring Grants , have not corrected a longstanding significant deficiency in grants monitoring reported by independent audits of USAGM's financial statements for the past 5 years.

""Over One Thousand Scientific Studies Prove That the COVID-19 Vaccines Are Dangerous, and All Those Pushing This Agenda Are Committing the Indictable Crime of Gross Misconduct in Public Office  

Just over 12 months from deployment of the COVID 19 emergency use experimental vaccines,  scientific studies in the thousands, and reports of criminal complaints of assault and murder from the illegal, unlawful use of biochemical poisons made to police forces around the country, verify an assault on an unsuspecting UK population.

Irrefutable science shows that the COVID 19 vaccine is not safe and not effective in limiting transmission or infection from the SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus pathogens.

The “safe and effective” false propaganda, put out by public officials who now are continuing to push this vaccine, is a clear breach of duty. 

A public office holder is subject to, and aware of, a duty to prevent death or serious injury that arises only by virtue of the functions of the public office.

Many have breached that duty and, in doing so, are recklessly causing a risk of death or serious injury, by carrying on regardless of the now-confirmed dangers associated with COVID 19 injections.

Some of these risks are blood clotting, myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis, Bell’s palsy, Guillain-Barre, cancer including deaths, etc.

All of these are confirmed in the following science-and-government-gathered data from the UK Health and Security agency on COVID 19 regarding vaccine damage.

The term “vaccine” was changed recently to incorporate this illegal, unlawful medical experiment to facilitate usage of mRNA technology that is demonstrably not a vaccine, and which contains biologically toxic nano-metamaterials associated with 5G urban data gathering capability.

Metal nanoparticulates are known in science to be genotoxic—a poison that can also cause sterilization. 

The dangers posed to the victims in the near term from this medical battery are now known. 

However, the long term lethality of this weapon is not as yet realized due to the debilitating effects it has on the immune system, causing  Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome(AIDS).

We can now confirm the 2017 depopulation defence-intelligence documents, showing the planned murder of over 55 million across the United Kingdom by 2025 using this biochemical weapon.

The Medicines and Healthcare (products) Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had prior warning of the expected large numbers of adverse reactions before the deployment—confirming the premeditated nature of the crime and public conduct offences then and now.

\*Original Post\*

I work as an anaesthetist and intensivist and sometimes / rarely the patients who are admitted to intensive care and their families are very upset and would shout at my colleagues, even calling them murderers, because the ""virus doesn't exist"". Of course my colleagues think they are derranged and privately laugh at these people, but actually there is a reason why, the statement, 'covid-19 is not caused by a virus,' is true. I will explain this now, but it's complex so this post is going to be lengthy, but hopefully easy to read.

First off, having a disease, even a ""viral disease"", doesn't mean it is caused by what we call a virus. Even though there is a decades long culture of studying viruses, with nobel prize winning scientists, and a whole field of virology and microbiologists who subspecialise in virology - it's possible that they are all wrong. So, put yourself in the mindset that a huge mistake has been made in the understanding of a virus, that all these people are wrong and now I will explain how, and what a virus actually is.

Scurvy used to spread through ships and people must have thought there is some contagion, if we had no knowledge of vit C deficiency, then these days we might have assumed it's a virus. Actually, we probably could relate scurvy to a virus because, what we call a virus should appear in people who have the disease of scurvy... and indeed on land we call this disease, Ebola.

Viruses are part of the communication mechanisms between cells, they contain genetic material in a protein capsule and they have receptors on top that bind to cells. Cells produce it, especially dying cells, to alarm other cells that there is high toxicity in the environment so that they all enter a state of conservation of life, therefore a person in that state will enter that mode and that removes all the energy from the body creating discomfort. So a cell that receives a toxic signal for whatever reason triggers the alarm by excreting what science calls a ""virus."" To alert others.

If the toxicity is greater than a certain range, then many cells will secrete what is called a virus, which is also a cellular mechanism for excreting or getting rid of internal toxicity. So a person with, let's say, flu, gets like this because of an energy collapse caused mostly by prolonged stress, so their body goes into shock, and other opportunistic organisms take advantage of a weak immune system, I mean bacteria, staph, candid, and so on, which were previously in a state of balance with the body. This extra toxicity causes the excretion of this cellular exosubstance that we call ""viruses"".

It has two main functions. A.- Give the alarm to other cells, by passing genetic information on, coding the nature of the alarm. (a good example of this, is blood oranges, which start out as normal oranges but when the environment becomes cold this triggers the release of a virus to warn the cells in the orange that it is a certain amount of cold, which triggers the transformation into what we call a blood orange, see: [https://youtu.be/Tryg5UCp6fI?t=2942](https://youtu.be/Tryg5UCp6fI?t=2942)) B.- Excrete the accumulated toxicity inside (when relevant) to try to survive.

So if a cell enters a state of toxicity, like a person's throat cell because they have been breathing cold air for a long time in a state of prolonged stress, then the bacteria in the throat are thrown out of balance by the stimulus of cold and the suppressed or weak immune system. And the cells in the throat will start to secrete what humans call the flu virus. It is the effect of a problem, not the cause, we have it backwards.

Now something else happens ... When a person has a lot of flu, all their mucous membranes secrete that toxicity, that's what mucus is for, to get rid of what the body does not need, more than anything else of toxins of all kinds. So those secretions come out with coughs and sneezes and are full of viruses, but which could be more accurately described as exogenous-type cellular secretions, so these secretions, badly called viruses, are in the air and enter the mucous membranes of another person.

Remember these are alarm signals that something is wrong so these exo-genes enter the other person's biology and that other person's cellular receptors interpret it for what it is ... an alarm, and if that person is also under a lot of stress, that will trigger a chain signal making that person sick too.

But if that other person is not under stress and has a healthy immune system, another person's exo-gene signal will come through and perhaps alarm a group of cells but their body will quickly say, in its own way, that nothing is wrong and that person does not get sick. So that is why some people get the flu and others don't.

It is worth mentioning that when a person is under a lot of stress, it is most likely that the person is not alone under that stress but that their companions, the other people in their family or community are also under it. So the weaker person will begin to excrete that toxicity and start a chain reaction with their entire family for the exo-gene warning signs it gives off.

Now, each type of ""virus"", that as I have said is only exo-gene, has precise information and precise receptors that can only be coupled to one class of cells and not to others. In other words, it is specific to a species or even to a specific area or group of cells within a body.

That is, if a bird has a disease that attacks the filaments or roots of the feathers, it will secrete those exo-gene signals and they will be in the air, and perhaps a human being breathes it in... The receptors do not match the ones of human cells, so it does not couple and does not pass its information ... Or in the event that if it does... the receiving human cell will say: wait, I have no feathers, this alarm information is for Goldfinches and Swallows .... and will discard the information. This is why a virus is said to be specific to one species or another.

But species, especially those in the same family in general yes they share cell receptors, it is why cats can ""get sick"" from the flu if a human sneezes. Because even though it is a cat, exo-gene receptors are compatible and if the cat is under stress or favorable conditions, it will also trigger symptoms.

Now if you have a culture of healthy cells in a laboratory culture and you introduce a virus (badly called virus) it will be coupled to the first one it finds and this cell will give off the alarm, secreting more viruses (exo-gene) and it will start a chain reaction which virologists misinterpret as ""a viral infection"". And this invasion in a laboratory test tube will be dramatic because those cells are not supported by an immune system because they are outside of a body. Also in the case of viral cultures the cells in the medium are starved of nutrients and primed with poisonous antibiotics - i.e., they are under a lot of stress.

Science is in diapers with all of this. I have found some very basic ground works that say there are cellular secretions that ""look"" like viruses but are not. They do not go beyond that. So, with covid there is no pathogenic virus of any kind. We have it all upside down, mistaking correlation for causation and having little to no knowledge of what ""viruses"" are. This also implies that the virus gain of function angle is irrelevent, although I have no doubt that such research was conducted, it makes little to no difference in the real world.

But there is more!

So these people in Wuhan or wherever they were, were seeing great toxicity in the bodies of the sick from other things like for example 5G type electromagnetic radiation & air pollution, so they did their human studies ... and found what they call ""viruses"". And these are only alarm signals triggered between cells because of high environmental toxicity. And ignorant doctors said that was the reason. A virus! And they raise the alarm.

They develop a very basic test to detect certain proteins, which are those of cellular exo-gene secretion and if someone has more than a certain number of them, then they are said to have covid-19. And of course they raise the alarm, they lock up the population, the Chinese start with their outrages, their population is in survival mode and under much, much stress and ... not surprisingly they secrete more exo-gene, they give them the test and surprise they also have covid-19. Lock them up! Then it passes to more people to everyone and there they have their pandemic. That is why it is in part a pandemic of fear, and the numbers are manipulated using silly rules such as everyone who dies of any cause within 28 days of a positive test died of covid etc... And now, the all cause mortality really is going up because of... vaccines and ongoing fear / stress and rebranding the flu as covenza or whatever they are up to these days...

If you want to understand some work that has been done on this front, then I recommend the booklet called Breaking The Spell by Tom Cowan, which goes into more detail about the viral culture and how the field of virology has failed to do the control experiment.

Alas, that's not going to stop me from writing this all out. So without further ado, here goes nothing.  

You may remember me as the guy who wrote this [**rather popular and controversial Open Letter directed at the general, unawakened populace**](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/conhke/an_open_letter_to_everyone_who_has_forever_mocked/). The letter got everything from appreciation and ridicule to mockery, threats, and questions being raised about my sanity. Which is all fine with me - after all, my job was to get people to *start asking questions.* And the post succeeded *immensely well* at that. Now, however, I wish to address my Open Letter to an entirely different set of audiences; and for an entirely different reason. That unique set of audiences are ALL OF YOU REGULARS of **r/Conspiracy.** Now that that part is out of the way, let me get to the core crux of my message here:  

Every time I log on into this sub (and those times are ever growing lesser and lesser now) - I see SO MUCH fear and negativity being posted EVERYWHERE I LOOK. *So many* people worried about humanity being wiped out, or enslaved to an ever greater degree -- all over again. **So many people** afraid that 5G or Chemtrails are about to cause a literal doomsday. So many people reacting with fear, anger, hatred, anxiety, worry and what-have-you to every small thing. And do you know the best part? They all do this *whilst ridiculing* the ***""rest of the asleep sheeple"".*** How ironic.  

Because - and unless *you're the one who's really asleep* - it shouldn't take you too much research to realize that the REAL BIG SECRET THAT NO ONE EVER TELLS YOU to keep ALL OF HUMANITY enslaved, is that **YOU ARE THE CREATOR OF YOUR OWN DAMNED REALITY.** That is, **YOUR thoughts and YOUR emotions and YOUR intentions are ultimately what create your reality.** But I'll get to that in a moment.  

The thing is, that even if you *outright refuse to believe* that you create your reality by your own thoughts - what *good* are you doing exactly, by scaring the shit out of people and predicting fucking *doomsday* every third comment? What *positive change* are you going to bring about by *constantly complaining and cribbing* about how *controlled* and *powerless* you are; and downvoting and mocking anyone who expresses *as much as a single shred* of ***hope*** for the better? For who exactly is the ""brainwashed sheep"" here really...*them* or ***you?***  

Even if you *don't believe* that your thoughts create your reality, by all means, go utilize your tangible ways to awaken the masses. It's not like those methods are *wrong* or anything in any case. Go speak an awakening truth or two in your everyday Reddit comments in your default subs; or go join an actual initiative or protest against greedy corporates or governments; or if nothing else, simply bring up these topics every once in your while in your actual real-life chats with your friends and family. Because **EVERY SMALL STEP HELPS HUMANITY'S AWAKENING in some way or the other.** Anything, absolutely ANYTHING is better than spreading meaningless negativity, pessimism, doomsday fears, and the *""We are all mind-controlled by the Illuminati""* narrative. Because ironically, the MORE that you give over your power to THEM, the MORE you ACTUALLY become THEIR slave and support THEIR cause. Which is EXACTLY what **THEY WOULD WANT** YOU TO DO in any case! **Con-fucking-gratulations on becoming the very thing you swore to destroy!** You just got *played.*  

And if you DO know that you create your reality by your own thoughts, words and actions - then it is *about fucking time* that you learned, practiced and displayed some of those skills in your daily lives FOR REALS. **Worrying and fearing shit** ***isn't*** **going to solve** ***anything*** - in fact, it is ONLY going to make things actually worse because most humans (spiritually awakened ones included) -- have still NO FUCKING CLUE as to HOW FUCKING POWERFUL their thoughts really are.  

The more you tell yourself how much of a slave you are, the more you will find yourself getting enslaved. The more you focus on the fears and the worries, the more will they take over - both - your lives and your world. The more you fear for your life and your loved ones and getting imprisoned upon this hell - the more powerfully will you CREATE IT IN YOUR LIFE...both, for yourselves, AND for your loved ones. And for the sake of YOU, YOUR LOVED ONES, and ALL OF HUMANITY, I implore you...to ***STOP FUCKING DOING THAT.*** STOP sabotaging your future. STOP sabotaging your loved ones' futures. STOP sabotaging HUMANITY'S future. And WAKE UP. To WHO YOU REALLY ARE. To your TRUE POWER. To your TRUTH as a being of UNTOLD AMOUNTS OF LOVE, POWER, WISDOM and LIGHT. As a CREATOR BEING.  

**The law of energy is rather simple:** What you focus on, you continue to get more of. Focus on the doomsday realities and you'll find yourselves experiencing one. Focus on love, light, upliftment, inspiration, creativity, joy, and motivation - and you'll help NOT ONLY YOURSELVES but also YOUR ENTIRE WORLD.  

To those who still disbelieve this, let me assure you the fact that ""mind trumps matter"" is absolutely *nothing new or unusual.* For straight from Yogis in India to the Shamans in South America -- to Shaolin Monks (whose incredible feats of mental ability and inhuman strength you can even see captured on video) and others, the powers of our mind have FOR LONG been documented. You can even see it when people do downright impossible things under hypnosis. Or just go read out some of the record entries held within the Guinness Book of World Records to some of your more skeptical buddies, without telling them it's a real record. Most will outright disbelieve that humans are capable of any of that shit that they have done. But they HAVE INDEED done it -- things that are *by no means* within the *known range* of ""human possibilities"". Why? *Think about it.* Also think about the implications of some of the findings in Quantum Physics and Relativity which downright shattered many assumptions of traditional/classical Physics. Put the pieces together guys. You should easily be able to - you're all *Conspiracy Theorists* here after all.

**Also, even if it's just for a second guys, think about this:** Do you not think it to be extremely unusual and wondrous that humanity has survived for so long, despite the many, many numerous fucking odds stacked against them -- only to have made it here till date, alive and well for the most part? Weren't there *countless opportunities* for World Wars and Mass Shootings etc. to threaten our *very existence* ***multiple times over,*** over the past few years *alone?* And YET, most of us are STILL HERE, alive and kicking for some unknown reason? To speak nothing of the numerous comets that have flown REAL CLOSE to us; but somehow, never closely enough to destroy our civilization in its entirety? That perhaps, just perhaps, ALL is not just left to chance as we are so often told to believe it is? Think about it a little deeper folks. And come to your own conclusions.  

Here are a few curated links to assist folks trapped in fear and worry during this rather challenging time:

**Feel free to share this message with anyone in need of it.** And trust me, it will cause more positive changes than what you can even as much as imagine at this point in time. Cheers!  

**EDIT:** For a moment, I'd like you all to think about the true PURPOSE of this virus, and of the countless other things that afflict and affect our worlds. The *purpose* my friends, is to spread more fear and get rid of love. Just *take a look* at all of the messaging built-up around this virus - and it will *all* be as clear as day to you. **""Hoard""** --- else you and your loved ones will die. *""No more handshakes and hugs or any form of* ***love*** *and affection""* --- else you and your loved ones will die. *""Freak the fuck out""* --- else you and your loved ones will die. *""Obey our orders and stay imprisoned within your homes like the pathetic little prisoner-slaves that you all are.""* --- else you and your loved ones will die.  

NO messaging of compassion. NO messaging of positivity. NO messaging that promotes love. None whatsoever. Guys, I am NOT saying that we shouldn't at all keep some stock of foods with us for a rainy day -- lest all of the shops close down or transportation gets affected. But hoarding the fuck out of things to the extent that your *own human brethren* will probably have nothing to eat and drink due to *your* senseless greed? Where is the LOVE in that? Where is the UNITY in that? Where is the COMPASSION and SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD in that? Can you *really see* what is being promoted in here under the guise of a ""horrible pandemic""? **It is time to rise above all this and find LOVE once again.** It is indeed, the *need of the hour.*  

I recommend that you all watch [**""When You Help Others, You Also Help** ***Yourself""***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH2R_fJOFI0) by Chris Do, founder of The Futur. Like this guy GETS IT. I've seen so many of his videos and this has always been his *one consistent message* -- and I'm not even *from* the domain (of design) that he's in. But he's out there, putting out really inspiring, but most importantly, self-empowering content for free in a world that is all about *holding-back-their-success-secrets.* He even does a lot of exciting self-improvement content - and this guy used to be an introvert like me once. Does he ultimately benefit from this, even in a financial sense so to speak? *Of fucking course* he does. But then, he is giving back *so much more.* Which is how good things come to him to begin with. If only more people understood this (what you give out is what you get back) - our world would be an *entirely different fucking place.* ***Think about it.***

Also, hit up **r/UpliftingNews** every once in a while. Because guess what, there is a HELLUVA LOT MORE **LOVE** and **GROWTH** and **ADVANCEMENT** and **COMPASSION** and **POSITIVE CHANGE** occurring in this world than there is fear, shittiness, cruelty, and *what-have-you.* But the *news media* isn't going to show all of *that* to *you.* It's *not* worth a lot of ratings and profits, you see. So then, YOU have to make the concentrated effort to go out there and seek it, encourage it, and ultimately *share it*, with the world out there. For once again, what you focus on, you only continue to get more of. And that's just *energy 101.* Cheers.",conspiracy,5G

What have you? The same prestigious magazine then issues this basic retraction. Confused editor? I heavily doubt it.

Just look at this fucking bullshit rhetoric, with a quote from Paul Simon at the end for MAJOR IRONY points:

""The furor of the 5G issue, of course, goes far beyond *Scientific American*’s Web site: protests on the topics have erupted the [world](https://lenews.ch/2019/09/27/thousands-protest-against-5g-mobile-rollout-in-swiss-capital/) [over](https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/5g-phone-mast-protest/),  underpinned by disinformation perpetuated across social media. In this  respect, is it a microcosm of a much greater problem, where online  disinformation has poisoned discourse in everything from medicine to  politics. [Conspiratorial thinking](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905) is endemic in such circles, and we readily fall victim to the phenomenon of [illusory truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect),  rendering us much more likely to accept falsehoods when repeatedly  exposed to them. And perhaps worst of all, every one of us is vulnerable  to [motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning),  lured into curating only information that chimes with our prejudices  and jettisoning that which does not. To quote Paul Simon, “All lies and jest, still the man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.” 

I don't know about you, but the irony in basically trying to say online information is disinformation when it disagrees with the State is not lost on me. Love to punch this guy in the face.

We all are just fucking imbeciles falling victim to falsehoods guys, it's the corporations and government that know best. K.

The gas has been lit. But what will we be 'resetting'? 

Of course, our entire way of being is what's being 'reset', but in the Machiavellian problem/reaction/solution script offered up by the technocrat corporate fascists who run the world, the ""Great Reset"" will be the global financial system. 

Hyperinflation has run amok. It always does. In ancient Rome, Emperor Diocletian had cheap copper washed in silver in order to debase Rome's currency. He introduced strict price controls to try and hide it. It happened in the German Weimar Republic, [""Speculation alone, while adding nothing to Germany's wealth, became one of its largest activities. The fever
to join in turning a quick mark infected nearly all classes..Everyone from the elevator operator up was playing the market.""] (https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1363239456388435969?s=20) 

The temptation of inflation is too great for whomever controls the currency. (For some it wasn't a temptation but a goal in itself) When labour, which is man power, the lives of working individuals, is translated into money then money too becomes the stored power of workers. If you could simply press a button and build battleships and aircraft carriers with your mind, traverse the globe 1 million times in a private jet, bed with scores of prostitutes, have every desire become reality, would you do it? 

This is the biggest red pill of all: All the power and wealth in the world comes from rulers who have spent 100 years debasing currency, stealing the power of workers. The Bank of International Settlements, Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, IMF, and every gigantic LLC on Wall Street have been literally printing money, debasing our currency, and stealing our wealth, our lives, and our countries from right under our feet. Then all of this new debased money follows into television, pharmaceuticals, automakers, textiles, electronics, etc, etc, the company valuations rise, and the debts needed to purchase the companies rise with them. Then the bonuses rise, the salaries rise (for the executives and CEOs) and the 1% become richer and richer, and even more powerful as they dominate the markets, the real estate market, stock market, commodities, etc, etc. 

This is how [billionaires made $3.9 trillion during the pandemic] (https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-made-39-trillion-during-the-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccines-2021-1) and how [workers lose $3.7 trillion during the pandemic.] (https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-lost-37-trillion-in-earnings-during-the-pandemic-2021-1) **It is not a coincidence that this all happened at a time when the US printed more money in 1 month than in 200 years.** [Source] (https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-printed-more-money-in-one-month-than-in-two-centuries) 

We know the playbook, use your eyes and see what is happening. Workers make the same for 30 years, house prices explode, stocks explode, executive salaries explode, and prices are heavily controlled to hide it. If there is an economy between you and me, I have $100 and you have $100, then we each control 50% of the total supply of money. If I create another $100 and give it to myself, now I have $200 and you still have $100, now I control 66.6% of the total money supply and you control 33.3% of the total supply. 

I just stole from you. Do you see how wrong this is? Do you see how unjust? This is a silent fascism perpetuated by the global financial cabal. Who also owns all the media and weapons manufacturers and food supply and energy infrastructure. Here, I'll get you started, [go to Yahoo Finance and search any company and look at top institutional shareholders, this is Facebook.] (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/holders?p=FB) It's all banks and hedge funds. Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street. Check every major company you can think of. 

We are controlled by inflation. They print money and control everything and we lose. 

The technocrat corporate fascists' goal is to run up inflation to its highest point, and bring everything down in a crumbling ball of fire. They want us defaulted, completely broke, homeless, without food, without electricity, and begging for solutions. And their solution is technocratic fascism. Everyone has a digital ID. Everyone gets mandatory vaccinations/ medical experiments. No one owns any property (you'll own nothing and you'll be happy!). No one travels. No one has unapproved contact and associate with others (don't spread one of the 16 variant mutations!). No one has any opportunity for economic mobility. All dissent will be silenced (what was Julian Assange's crime deserving of 2 years solitary at Belmarsh?). 

Part of the new techno corporate fascist infrastructure will be blockchain technology, the foundation of the 4th industrial revolution, the bringer of the Internet of Things. With blockchain and smart contracts, and 5g internet with smart devices, the entire material universe will be put on the internet (seriously). But people won't just willingly accept a new cryptocurrency, or many new cryptocurrencies, as the de facto ruling currencies. And the fascists would rather fear people into a new paradigm than educate anyway. 

So a cyber attack will take place that will be worse than 9/11 in order to create the conditions necessary to rollout the new blockchain global economy. This winter storm going down to Texas has wrecked wheat crops in the US, and the US is already short on soybeans. What happens when foundational food sources such as wheat, corn and soybeans, disappear? All other food prices rise. A food shortage similar to [the Chinese famine] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#Famine) under Mao Zedong's China is being manufactured to occur in the United States. This is a controlled demolition of America that is unfolding in slow motion. The techno corporate fascists are scared shitless because they've been harvesting our data and analyzing it on mass for the past two decades. They know we know all their crimes, they know we know what's wrong with society and how to fix it, and they know that if we rise up they will never have power again, that their time will truly be over. So they've decided to wage a war against the general public. It's their only option. Either rollout tech fascism or lose all the palaces, jets, fortunes, slaves, everything. They picked fascism.

The South Atlantic Magnetic Field Anomaly (SAMFA) is a mega monster magnetic field hole that stretches from South America all the way to South Africa. The magnetic field in that massive area is so weak that satellites have to powered off for their own safety.

SMAFA is moving west 12 mile per year and is starting to split into two. This is extremely important because solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and humans. Scientists are obviously told to downplay the danger. 20 million people live right under the hole in the city of Sao Paulo.

Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYF1JI8Atc)  \- YT 6 min - Best part starts at 2:45

Scientists and policymakers don't want you to know that magnetic pole shifts can happen in as little time as a hundred years. It can take up to a thousands years too. When this occurs, the earth can have as many as 5 magnetic poles slowly moving around the planet. Exposure to solar/space radiation is increased under these poles which can take up to a decade to pass overhead. Solar/space radiation is harmful to both plants and animals.

I believe that the SAMFA splitting into two is the beginning of the multi-polar phenomena. Policymakers prohibit discussion of it by scientists due to fear, panic, money etc. - the usual suspects. It's why you don't know so many things that are extremely important to your well being.

At the same time that the SAMFA gets weaker, we are also losing mid latitude lower stratospheric ozone, which together with the magnetic field, also protects us from the sun. Again policymakers do not want you to know this, that's why there's been a rash of ""Ozone Hole Healing"" articles in recent months.

This is due to scientific academic fraud. The chemicals that were burning a hole in the ozone have not gone away, they are being smuggled as a matter of routine out of China into the US and Europe. The chemicals that replace them are hardly any better. Air conditioning demand is so big that it will use up all our renewable energy power by 2050.

Challenges for the recovery of the ozone layer

The reason this is happening is because of construction fraud. China has built more city blocks in 10 years than America ever did in its whole history. They pour more cement in 3 years than America ever did in 300 years. Substandard material construction fraud is rampant because cement requires a special sand that is quickly running out. Desert sand won't do. So what do we do? We lie about what sand we are using, that's why new condos in Australia and Canada will only last 25 years instead of 50, it's also why new condos are falling apart in Australia.

Do you remember when Volkswagen was caught doing emissions fraud? Turns out it wasn't just them. Fraud in the safety of products and processes are prevalent in the market. This means that fraud is rampant in the control of social media.

5G will kill bees trees and kids. Men are taller and stronger than women. Elon Musk is a fraud. Zero gravity is zero good for your brain and eyes.

The control of social media, and the minds of millions of kids, is paramount to our unending desire to get rich destroying earth. Both capitalism and socialism are based on plenty. Everything you think you know is 100 years old.

We have to stop burning 50% of fuel in 10 years. Scientists are not allowed to say that. They are told they must say, we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. They get paid by tax dollars so they do what they're told.  This is probably one of the last places I'm not banned, and even where I am not banned, these ideas are fought against tooth and nail by young people. The world is run by crooked experts and trigger happy mods. The sons and daughter of the ad media who told you cigarettes are safe, are the same people pushing green energy and 5G - both frauds.

What’s happening in the world is a two part phenomenon: it’s both cosmic and by extension political. 

Cosmically, everything that’s happening in the world is an alchemical process. The corrupt “powers that be” has to self destruct (#causehistory) by essentially committing the highest of violations. Rather you want to acknowledge it or not, the  global melanated majority has been feeling the atrocities for the pass 400 years by THIS particular group (the crown), and now that these violations have crossed “racial” barriers....THEIR time is officially up. The veil is lifting.
The aboriginal peoples of these lands are very essential to turning the tides in this process, hence their focus on BLM (more on that in another thread). Many people are recognizing that they’ve been lied to about many things...but the truth is we’ve been lied to about EVERYTHING. All the history that you’ve been fed are lies. We’ll eventually have to address the lies to fully understand what happening.

2020 was prophecized (from many cultures globally)and mapped out astrologically (for those of you that follow it), so our global leaders have been gradually preparing us for this moment. Essentially their fall. We have entered a new age: The Golden Age BKA The age of KNOWING.
So they released this virus to usher in the 5G because THEY will no longer have control. Their plan is to usher in the NWO, and essentially make bots out of our “ not so bright” loved ones and colleagues. They WILL be able to control them via nanotechnology and social credit BS. 
This has always been a spiritual process.

My advice, begin to accept the fact that we’ve been lied to and brainwashed, and it’s now time to unlearn and walk righteously. Soften your hearts. Because once the REAL truth get out, it’s going to be very traumatic for many people. 

The GREAT news is, the tides ARE turning.

61,Theory: Marijuana Disrupts Mind Control Programming,334.0,cxilr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cxilr1/theory_marijuana_disrupts_mind_control_programming/,228.0,1567179496.0,"This is a topic that I haven't really seen discussed much. I wanted to throw it out there to get feedback from others and to get their thoughts on this theory. Lately, I've been doing research into brainwaves, EMF, etc. and their effects on humans. Most of us are aware that technologies that emit EMF radio like 5G, Wifi, cell phones, Television etc. There has already been research done that proves these EMF waves have negative effects on humans and IMO they are being used to control us in a certain way or to keep our brainwaves operating at a lower frequency so we ""conform"" more and ask questions and question reality less.  
  
This all started when I found [some research by the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210004-8.pdf) that proved when you listen to certain sound frequencies that mimic your brain waves you can essentially ""force"" your brain into a certain state. There is research that says this is true and untrue but I believe it is true to a certain extent. Listening to it for a very short time probably won't effect much but I don't think any of the studies have done any long term effects on this. 
  
[It's proven that watching TV is equivalent to staring at a blank wall and it keeps you mostly in the Alpha waves which is related to falling asleep.](http://www.brainhealthandpuzzles.com/television_and_brain_function.html) Coincidentally , around the time that [TV became mainstream in American homes,](https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-of-the-television/) is the same time that [marijuana was made illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States)  
  
So the first part of the theory is that EMF and other forms of waves do have an effect on how we act and think and can be used to keep us in a certain state.  
  
I've recently been reading a book that brought up a related point about ancient temples. [There are ancient temples that were built and literally mimic certain sound frequencies](https://phys.org/wire-news/164386603/ancient-man-used-super-acoustics-to-alter-consciousness-and-spe.html) which further proved my theory might be true. If this was known knowledge back then it has to be related.  
  
Now where marijuana comes in. I [Found a study where they looked at the brainwaves after people smoked marijuana.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gdy85/what-your-brain-looks-like-after-a-spliff-space-cookie-eeg-trajectory-876)  
> With Ana's two subjects, ""It was clear that the cerebral rhythm was faster after smoking and that wave amplitude was larger—which doesn't mean that things function chaotically, but that the **brain is in a higher alert state,""**  
  
>  You can see that the ""after"" trajectory is completely different from the first, as the changes appear on both a morphological wave level (bigger amplitude, typical aspect) and rhythm level (higher frequency, chaotic aspect).  
  
[Marijuana makes the brain ""nosier"".](https://www.psypost.org/2018/07/cannabis-users-exhibit-increased-brain-activity-rest-study-finds-51702) Which to me proves that it's the opposite effects of a TV and makes your mind more active which in theory would mean it's less likely to be ""controlled"". Which might explain why most users are more creative when they smoke. Which is most likely why try made it illegal right when television came out so less people would be able to ""resits"" the television waves. I can't see this being a random co-incidence and kinda proves why it's still a schedule 1 drug today. Most of the big pharma drugs make people tired and sedated which is why they want to keep those mainstream and not Marijuana based medicines.  
  
What do you guys think?

Hashtags are showing an alarming trend of near-empty hospitals. Renegade doctors are making videos pleading how the case reporting is pure fantasy and that the numbers are wildly inaccurate.

People are not as stupid as they seem. Sooner or later the bad movie will get old. The numbers reviewed in retrospect will show deep troughs in reported flu deaths, deep troughs in reported pneumonia deaths and deep troughs in reported heart attack or related fatalities. Put along side a super spiked curve of Covid19^TM related deaths, it'll be painfully obvious their numbers were cooked-up hysteria that destroyed a global economy and pushed hard for mass-vaccinations, sweeping DNA warehousing and 5G-tracked ""hall passes"" for those who get ""cleared"" by the Red Coats.

With this post I want to further flesh out my trail of thought and I believe this subreddit would be the best place to do so.

Before we begin, however, a small disclaimer: this is all speculation and conjecture and is the result of a thought experiment in the mind of a sovereign individual who enjoys to think, question and postulate hypotheses. I cannot prove any of it, so read it as you would read fiction.

Now, on with it:

#The vaccine in of itself is not the endgame

But it provides a framework and foundation for a method of mass population control. A trail of thought:

##Service Access Control

Ticketmaster plans to prohibit anyone from attending events without a negative test result in the past 24-72 hours. Many details of the plan, which is still in development phase, will rely on three separate components -- the Ticketmaster digital ticket app, third party health information companies like CLEAR Health Pass or IBM's Digital Health Pass and testing and vaccine distribution providers like Labcorp and the CVS Minute Clinic. (source: https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan/)

On the surface of it, to prevent the spread of the virus at mass gatherings, this does appear to be a reasonable, simple and understandable logic. Most people won't think twice and just accept it because it makes sense because it makes sense in stopping the spread of the virus.

Members of the US president elect's COVID task force suggests to bundle services that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) as a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. This includes but is probably not limited to: food security, rent assistance, free clinic services. (source: https://www.naturalnews.com/files/200709-The-Publics-Role-in-COVID-19-Vaccination.pdf)

Now as we've already been conditioned to _""wear a mask""_, _""keep your distance""_ and _""wash your hands""_ notifications before entry anywhere, it's not such big a leap to _""proof of vaccine or no admittance""_ signs popping up everywhere. This will effectively require you to prove you've been vaccinated in order to attend events, access medical care, buy groceries, cross a border, ...

(Note: this does not require the virus itself to be a hoax, but we _are_ conditioned to the masks and the overall literature depicting and delimiting appropriate behavior required to access services)

Edit: as noted by Coches in the comments below, Slovakia has begun blanket testing and implementing harsh restrictions similar to house arrest for those that do not comply with voluntary testing (source: https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/europe/slovakia-mass-coronavirus-test-intl/index.html) 

##ID2020

Now that the general public is primed to accept these measures comes the next question, for those of us that still ask questions, _how_ will we meet these requirements and prove that we've been vaccinated? Now some of us conspiracy theorists suggested the vaccine will contain a micro chip with RFID that can be scanned at checkpoints. While we do have this technology available, our overlords know that we won't accept this _yet_. Instead, it's far easier to use the technology that's already in place en masse. Just look at how Ticketmaster is creating an app to join forces with medical data gathering houses.

We can give everyone who's vaccinated a unique and globally identifiable token in a central government controlled database. You can authenticate on these apps using a government issued token which you receive upon vaccination and then provide the checkpoints with a QR code that validates your vaccination status thus giving you access to these public and private services. Not really that hard nowadays if you know anything of IT.

Anyway, now that we've established identification and verification at various private and public service checkpoints, there's a couple of tangents that seem unrelated to the uninitiated of ""connecting the dots"".

##5G Localization

_""5G spr3ADs CoRonA V1rus!""_ is a false flag conspiracy theory. What I mean by that is that is a theory inserted into the conspiracy community to make us look like dim-witted fools and to ostracize anyone questioning 5G.

In a technologically advance world, we do need such network for all the Internet of Things to communicate efficiently with as little ping as possible. One of the benefits of 5G is that we can pinpoint a device's location to up to decimeter accuracy (source: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/industry-articles/how-will-5g-networks-improve-location-awareness/)

This is great news because we have the ID2020 installed on our smartphones and that means that the authorities can locate any one registered individual to their exact location at all times. Because let's not forget, you can't access any public or private service without proper identification (the vaccination registration database makes sure of that)

Of course, the rural areas will continue to enjoy 4G with it's lesser advanced technology, but you can still be tracked to within a couple of meters of accuracy.

##End-to-End Encryption

The first tangent I want to explore are the global attempts at banning end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication and encrypted data in cloud storage.

In the US, the EARN-IT act attempts to backdoor E2EE, this act is now in the house of representatives (source: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/urgent-earn-it-act-introduced-house-representatives) as well as the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that aims to subvert secure cloud data storage (source: https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/why-lawful-access-encrypted-data-act-threat-your-rights-and-privacy)

Recently, this topic has come up at the EU council as well, weighing the pros and cons of encryption in privacy vs (state) security. It doesn't straightforward suggest to ban or backdoor E2EE, but it does state that _""law enforcement and judicial authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner""_ (source: https://www.statewatch.org/media/1434/eu-council-draft-declaration-against-encryption-12143-20.pdf)

This is the point where I should tell you to read between the lines, but let me spell out my thoughts anyways: **both EU and US are under the control of the same shadow government.**

##Big Data Algorithms

All major social media platforms collect your data and run it through an algorithm to build a profile of you so it can feed you content you are more likely to interact with. TikTok being the latest addition which is currently the third most downloaded non-gaming app of the year (source: https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/)

TikTok has a really good algorithm that gives users the content that they want. So good in fact that the US government threatened to ban the app if it didn't get a piece of the pie (or do you really think it was about the security and privacy of its citizens after proposing two bills that undermine this anyway?)

Extensive data collection + algorithm = digital gold for marketeers and governments alike. That _profile_ that is built with the collected data from social media applications reflects not only your interests commercially but also your political ideologies.

##Quarantine Camps

New Zealand, an example to the entire world in terms of progressiveness, is raising quarantine camps to hold anyone testing positive (even against their will) until they test negative. (source: https://thegreggjarrett.com/new-zealand-announces-quarantine-camps-where-positive-patients-will-be-forcibly-placed/)

This is a precursor to vaccination camps, where we will be culling the population that does not comply with the ""guidelines"" at first and later anyone that can be profiled as a dissident to the New World Order (based on social media big data collection and the compromise of your E2EE private messaging)

If you do not believe people are capable of such atrocities, I suggest you read the Gulag Archipelago, an account of the Communist regime in the USSR of past century. Or do you think we humans have evolved beyond such systemic incarceration? Just look at the war on drugs and how many people are behind bars for what is now being legalized (Cannabis _and_ psychedelics) There's no need for physical torture if they can just lock you up where you can do no harm to ""civilized"" society.

##The Plan

In summary, the population needs to keep its attention focused on elected and fact-checked news outlets in which the authorities will tell you what the narrative is. Keeping you fear-induced and providing you with the deus ex machina solution (a well known marketing strategy, source: https://brenits.com/scare-tactics-in-branding-and-marketing/ and https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/10/fear-based-appeals)

Most people will get their vaccine as such and just like that. Then another portion of the population will get theirs to get access to the services they need. Vaccination camps will be introduced for anyone unwilling to comply.

Because we won't accept RFID chips just yet, we start by introducing the smartphone as the first platform to track your vaccination / compliance status to access services you require.

All of this can be linked to our social media accounts as well as your private communications upon which a profile can be built. Anyone profiled as a threat to the New World Order can have their vaccination status revoked, be located and sent to vaccination camps (remember, their goal is not the vaccination in of itself, that's only the narrative, the reality is to get rid of dissidents)

#The Goal

What's the purpose of all this though? A New World Order? The Great Reset?

The social contract is changing, whether we like it or not. Watch the World Economic Forum's video on the Great Reset (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHRkkeecg7c) and tell me these people aren't bigger than governments.

It's the pandemic now, the climate crisis next. We will police ourselves into ushering in a New World Order. On the one hand I can believe this to bring about a global Utopian society without warring countries, pandemics or climate crises. But ignorance is bliss until you take a closer look at how we get there, there's a shadow that stains the soul of humanity. 

I assure you, the frog never noticed the water heating up until it was boiling. But please, do keep watching television, believe the mainstream narrative, do not question your leaders on the magic picture box for they hold all the answers and the alternative is far uglier.

##Do Not Dispair

On a retrospective note, I do not wish for anyone to become afraid and would like to point to Charlie Chaplin's final speech at the end of The Great Dictator:

>To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

Now, I'm a foreign student in Europe. In my homecountry they give the Spoutnik V and Sinovac vaccines. However those vaccines are not approved in the EU, even though they're WHO approved. Before vaccination was open for people my age in Europe, my parents had found me a spot back home to get the Russian vaccine, which I was going to get until it was announced that the EU didn't approve of those vaccines.

I decided to wait until there is global consensus as to not have to be vaccinated twice. 

I have been banned from three subs so far for saying: ""The Russian and Chinese vaccines are WHO approved but not approved in the EU. They don't work with the mRNA technology, they work with a viral vector technology."" Nothing more, nothing less. 

This is pure insanity. I have never been an anti-vaxx person, nor do I believe that this whole thing is in any way related to 5G or microchips, but the level of hostility of the ""pro forced vaccine"" people just shows the amount of propaganda that went into making people accept this new normal, and literally question **nothing**. 

I didn't even question shit, or wondered why they weren't approved, I just had to wait either way but got eaten like fresh meat by a pack of wolves calling me names and questioning my integrity because I didn't get a vaccine that isn't approved in my country of residency? What the heck? 

Even if you're not suspicious of vaccines such as myself, it is undeniable that the general attitude towards this vaccine reaches extremes on both sides, which in itself is suspicious as hell as there seems to be no general consensus. 

At this point I don't even want to be a part of this whole thing, I'll put myself in lockdown, I have been wearing FFP2 masks even when not required, using hydroalcoholic gel any chance I get, I don't care about going to the movies or the restaurant, I'll just keep on doing that, but honestly at this point I'd rather die of COVID than get any fucking vaccine.

# How Fluoride Affects Consciousness and the Will to Act

Recent research has brought the controversial practice of water fluoridation back into the spotlight, revealing links between water fluoridation and brain disorders, particularly in regard to its effect on children.

Troublingly, the report found that side-effects do not only come from direct ingestion by children, but also from higher levels of chemicals such as fluoride in expectant mothers' blood and urine, which was linked to brain disorders and lower IQs in their children.

In many cases, the changes triggered can be permanent. This evidence flies right in the face of spurious claims by skeptics that ingestion of fluoride in low concentrations has no harmful effects on our health.

Is it any wonder then that only seven countries in the world actually fluoridate more than 50 percent of their water supply?

Although it is often portrayed in America as if every country does it, this is very far from the truth.

In fact, the United States accounts for more than 50 percent of all the fluoridated water drinkers in the world, while the vast majority of European countries for example avoid this practice altogether.

>So what is fluoride and why do a few countries continue to infuse their public drinking water with this controversial chemical?What ramifications might its side effects have for human development?

## How Water Fluoridation Came to Be

Although there is widespread acceptance that fluoride is toxic in high doses, a trend emerged in the twentieth century to add this chemical to drinking water at dosages deemed to be ""safe."" Where did this trend originate?

It may surprise you to hear that apparently, the first occurrence of purposefully putting sodium fluoride into drinking water took place in the German ghettos of the 30s and 40s, and shortly thereafter in Nazi concentration camps.

Clearly, the Nazis would not be concerned with the strength and resilience of their prisoners' teeth; so,

>What could be the real reason to fluoridate the water?What effects does it really have upon us?And why are countries such as the United States still doing it?

Let's now look at how water fluoridation started in America.

An industry researcher from the Mellon Institute financed by the Alcoa Company first recommended water fluoridation in America in 1939. Seeing as Alcoa had toxic waste, a bi-product from aluminum otherwise known as fluoride, and stood to benefit from finding a way to sell and dispose of it, could this really be a coincidence?

The report convinced dentists and the public at large that water fluoridation is good for our teeth. With this, whether intended or not, the industry gained a way to get toxic waste off their hands, and moreover, even be paid to get rid of it - by selling it off to be dumped into the public water supply.

In 1946, an attorney and former counsel to Alcoa was appointed to head the U.S. Public Health Service.

Shortly thereafter, he ensured that the water fluoridation ""experiment"" passed essentially unchallenged and unchecked by any real public study or research and was soon given a $750K private bonus from Alcoa.

In today's dollars, that's worth anywhere from $6.89 million to $55.3 million, depending on how you account for inflation.

But some people have identified a more sinister agenda behind water fluoridation that goes beyond apparent greed and convenience. At the end of World War II, **Charles Elliot Perkins**, a researcher in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology, was sent to Germany to take charge of their chemical plants.

He later wrote in response to what he had seen and heard while there:

>""The real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty…

Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluorine will in time gradually reduce the individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing this area of the brain tissue, and making him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him.""

## How Fluoride Suppresses Consciousness

[ Pineal gland parenchyma with calcifications](https://preview.redd.it/dp131f5vzjr81.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=261022316e5eb84983ac183a236aa1ab5b5605d0)

But how does a chemical bi-product dumped into the water supply actually work upon those who ingest it over time?

There are many ways sodium fluoride consumption affects our bodies, but one aspect we'll focus on in this article is that sodium fluoride calcifies the pineal gland.

British scientist **Jennifer Luke** published a study (Fluoride Deposition in the Aged Human Pineal Gland) which found that fluoride deposits tended to accumulate in the pineal gland and calcify it.

In addition, a 450-page review on fluoride toxicity published by the National Research Council in 2006 reported that fluoride produced a range of negative side effects including,

>""decreased melatonin production"" and ""other effects on normal pineal function, which in turn could contribute to a variety of effects in humans.""

Not just scientists, but mystics too have explored the effects of the pineal gland within us (from different angles):

>physically, it plays an important role in regulating sleep patterns and sexual developmentspiritually, it is said to be a connection between the body and the soul, and is referred to by some as our ""third eye""

Either way, when the pineal gland is calcified by sodium fluoride, it obviously cannot function properly.

This could have grave effects both physically and spiritually upon humanity.

There is more to the human body than its physical apparatus. This is widely evident in phenomenon such as near-death experiences, whereby people have had accounts of experiencing existence while their brain and body has been clinically dead.

However, while we are here physically, the spiritual components depend upon the physical apparatus in order to function properly and thereby communicate and actively participate in the physical world. When an important seat of consciousness such as the pineal gland cannot function properly, by logical extension, consciousness itself cannot function properly within us, since the physical means with which it functions in the world have been damaged.

Thus, it is not only that fluoride consumption has adverse health effects and reputedly makes people easier to control (as the Nazis believed), but the very spiritual essence of who we are, our consciousness, can be hindered from manifesting in our lives.

Within our consciousness are all the spiritual feelings such as love, peace, happiness, and freedom, as well as mystical experiences and psychic faculties.

The consciousness gives us the ability to be ""here,"" ""awake,"" and present psychologically.

There are sinister agents in the world and beyond who wish to see consciousness suppressed. There appears to be an evil behind water fluoridation that runs deeper than mere convenience, and the implications go beyond fluoride's reputed effects of making people compliant who would otherwise question questionable things (such as water fluoridation – the irony notwithstanding).

On the deepest level, it's about a person's individual ability to awaken consciousness and experience their full potential.

# How Do We Prevent Pineal Gland Calcification?

Eliminating exposure to fluoride is the #1 priority. 

We can start by being careful about surreptitious forms of fluoride in Teflon, foods, and beverages produced with municipal water, tap water, infant formula, fluoride-containing drugs like Prozac, toothpaste, etc.

We have collected a number of studies from the US National Library of Medicine on natural substances which mitigate **fluoride toxicity**.

We also have a section on our database dedicated to finding substances that prevent or reverse other forms of pathological calcification which may have relevance for pineal gland calcification, such as **ectopic calcification**.

Lastly, there is research on the potential value of magnesium and phytate in reducing **pineal gland calcification**.

Harmful toxins such as methane, carbon, aluminum, barium, sulfur, strontium, fluoride, mobile/ satellite radiation as well as biochemicals are either slowly or rapidly oppressing your consciousness and killing your precious body.

There is no way to avoid what is currently occurring since this is a globalist operative military warfare operation being conducted on ordinary civilians. Whether you are living rural, urban, town, city, or off the grid, the poison holds its omnipresence.

Chemtrails are a huge part of weakening, suppressing, and killing our minds, and bodies. During the **Narco wars** in the 1980s against drug cartels, several South American governments including Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil sprayed carcinogenic causing elements over forests and jungles where natives were living. They did use the **""War On Drugs""** as a ***deliberate excuse*** to do this on purpose. The government and military officials were strategically trying to push these natives who were living peacefully in their homes into cities and steal their land. Exactly what they're trying to do in the Western World.

**Vaccine Companies Investigated For Manslaughter**

Why it Makes No Sense to Give the Hepatitis B Vaccine to Newborns.  
Folks, let’s make one thing perfectly clear here, **hepatitis B is VERY difficult to catch**. You nearly always need to have blood or sexual contact of some sort with an infected carrier. That is why the main risk factors for hepatitis B are IV drug abusers and those who engage in sex with multiple partners.

This, of course, makes it nearly impossible for a newborn to contract hepatitis B unless his mother already has it.

Further, vaccine-derived immunity is thought to be short-lived, and between 30 percent to 50 percent of vaccinated individuals may lose their antibodies within seven years.

Meanwhile, up to 60 percent of people who initially respond will lose detectable antibodies within 12 years. So that means that by the time these newborns get to the age when they could potentially engage in the risky behaviors that would put them at risk of hepatitis B, their childhood vaccine will provide little to no protection.

The central nervous system of a newborn infant is also particularly susceptible to toxic influences. This is one of the reasons why the hepatitis B vaccine is such a problem. If it were given later in life, as is done in many other countries, it would not be as problematic.

Even so, this vaccine is still associated with numerous side effects, such as an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid diseases. 

**Do Your Homework Before Vaccinating: The Drug Companies Won’t do it For You**  
Aside from highlighting the extreme lack of common sense that goes along with vaccinating a newborn against a disease they have a rare chance of getting until they’re much older, this article points out, once again, that the drug companies are not on your side.

Their primary motivation is in making profits, and if that means covering up side effects to make you believe vaccination is safe, they will likely do it.

Remember, you do have the right to refuse vaccinations, and there are two basic axioms you should never forget.

* Nobody, anywhere or any time, and under any circumstances has the right or power in this country to immunize you or your children against your will and conviction. If they attempt to do so, you can legally charge them with ""assault with a deadly weapon"" and have the full resources of the law behind you.
* At all times in attempting to avoid unwanted immunization, you have the Law of the Land behind you. Those who would try to vaccinate you against your will are on very shaky ground. Into every compulsory immunization law in America are written legal exceptions and waivers, which are there specifically to protect you from the attempted tyranny of officialdom. It is not only your right but your obligation to use them if this is what your conscience tells you.

While all 50 states have immunization requirements, 28 allow parents to opt-out for medical or religious reasons. Another 20 states allow parents to opt-out for personal or philosophical reasons as well.

* The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test that is currently being used is known not to work. This test, at best, tells analysts that you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. PCR will only tell the analyst that the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus - such as the huge family of coronaviruses. But that's all. PCR doesn't isolate for a specific virus, such as COVID-19.  It cannot tell you whether or not you have COVID-19, specifically.This is why you’re hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That’s because most coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.So even if you don't have COVID-19, the PCR test might pick up another coronavirus in your system and give a false positive reading for COVID-19.  And that’s not even getting into the other issue – viral load.  PCR is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that’s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a virus kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you, you need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can’t determine if it is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.  If you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren’t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnoses.  And coronaviruses are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have coronavirus DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well.  Do you see where this is going yet?

* Viruses are the perfect boogeyman, and the pandemic plot is absolutely genius. The viral pandemic plot checks all the ""evil takeover plan"" boxes.  Enough people blindly believe the medical and scientific establishment, governments and media propaganda that they could parlay this into a full ""New World Order"" takeover right now if they desire. I never dreamed it would be this easy to manipulate and control the entire world.  Real or contrived, a virus is the perfect boogeyman. Better than terrorism, nuclear annihilation or extraterrestrial invasion. We can't see it. We can't stop it. We can only hope to contain it. The enemy could be anywhere at anytime, and everyone who comes near you is a potential threat.  How convenient that the perfect tool for world domination should just fall right into their lap organically. It's almost too convenient.  It is very obvious that a script is playing out on the world stage in front of our eyes. The government, media, medical and scientific establishment all colluding to systematically erode every ounce of personal freedom we have left. All under the guise of protecting us from an invisible alien invader which we are powerless to defend ourselves against. Absolutely genius.  How many more millions of people have to be slaughtered by authoritarian regimes before we realize that centralization of power is never a good thing under any circumstances. ""Give me power so I can protect you"" is the oldest play in the book. If your plans were to replace the economy and political system in a short period of time and didn't want to run into the problem of civil unrest... just saying if there was a deadly virus going around it would be a great reason for people to stay cooped up and not go out and protest this new system.

In America, which has a homeless problem, there are **6x** more empty houses than there are homeless people. America has the largest prison population in the developed world, and by a huge margin. Millions are rotting in cages with murderers and sex criminals for low level drug offenses. In America, it’s not uncommon for the sick to choose to die instead of seeking medical treatment as it would lead to financial ruin for them and their family.

87,The overwhelming evidence of nanobots in the jabs.,236.0,pmh1j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pmh1j9/the_overwhelming_evidence_of_nanobots_in_the_jabs/,92.0,1631400142.0,"This is a very serious topic that needs to be addressed.  Below I have accumulated overwhelming evidence that these Covid jabs contain nanobots.  Yes, nanobots.  If that sounds ridiculous and sci-fi then read the evidence below because I can assure you, they are very real.

Nanobots are tiny machines that can be programmed to undergo a variety of tasks.  The material used to build these particular nanobots is graphene oxide (GO).  There is no conspiracy around whether or not GO is used to create these tiny robots.  It is widely discussed in the biomedical industry.  The sources for this are listed below.  The applications of GO are quite varied and are activated in a number of ways.  These ways include millimetre wavelength frequencies and Lidar laser technology.  The sources for this are listed below in the 'Graphene industry discussion' section.  Just in case the penny hasn't dropped, this refers to the 5G frequency range.  Lidar technology is found in all new model iphones, which is constantly pulsing out light on the non-visible spectrum.  None of this is conspiracy.  It is established engineering.

Below are multiple peer-reviewed sources stating that GO is used in biomedical technology.  The smoking gun paper describes its uses in Covid vaccines.  There is patent evidence of GO being used in Covid vaccines.  The main counter to this argument is that none of the vaccines list GO as a direct component.  This is invalid for several reasons; firstly, of all those ingredients official sources will list, you do not know what they all are.  Some are compounds that do not need to disclose their make up; Secondly, the nature of industry trade secrets mean that various materials do not need to be disclosed in this manner; Third, in the section below labelled ""Peer-reviewed evidence of GO used in medical treatments"" is a paper stating that GO can be stabilised in electrolyte solutions.  It can be added to saline and only saline needs to be listed as an ingredient.  There is a dozen ways they can introduce this compound into those jabs without it being officially listed.

'But bro, surely someone would notice and blow the whistle!'.  Yes, they would, and many have.  Of all the sources I list below the ONLY sources that any scientifically minded person can ignorantly disregard are the various organisations that have posted their data and findings showing GO contained in samples of the various jabs that they have acquired.  You can choose to ignore these sources if you want, and many of you will.  But you cannot ignore every other source that isn't in the category below labelled ""Non-mainstream sources of GO found in jabs"".  If you want to be a real scientist you can at least entertain the sources in that category.

So now we are left with the question: ""Why would people put nanobots into these jabs?""  I'm not going to answer that for you, that you need to think about for yourself.  The pharmaceutical industry has engaged in some of the most ruthless and unethical business models ever seen in human society.  The evidence for this is also overwhelming.  The largest civil lawsuit settlements on record have been paid out by pharmaceutical companies.  A settlement is one step down from an admission of guilt.  A large proportion of America is addicted to Fentanyl, a substance supplied to them by the pharmaceutical industry.  If you can't come up with a good answer of why these people would want to introduce nanobots into your body that can be activated by 5G frequencies or lidar technology you are beyond saving.  All new phones contain lidar technology.  5G towers went up all over the globe at the start of this pandemic and now litter our urban landscapes.  This isn't conspiracy.  Read the evidence below.  It is science and engineering.

You can choose to ignore all of this if you want.  Everything I have said is backed up by peer-reviewed science papers and industry sources.  The only sources that are unacceptable to the mainstream are researchers publishing their findings of the covid vaccines.  The only sources that can be ignored (because apparently science consists of ignoring contrary data these days) are whistle-blower sources.  What is the excuse for that?  Are these people just faking it to get clicks?  Really?  The only non-mainstream evidence is censored research.  Think about that for a minute. All this evidence very strongly suggests that if you have got one of these jabs, you have had nanobots introduced into your body.  Now you can be a child and choose to ignore all this and just hope that I am wrong, and all these science papers are just to fuck with you, and that those swell guys in the pharmaceutical industry have your best interests at heart.  Or you can be an adult, and face the reality that maybe, just maybe, an incredibly rich and powerful industry has used its enormous resources to profit off you and deceive you.  Deceive you into introducing a compound into your system that can be used to do almost anything to your body, using already established technologies.  

The only help I can offer if any of this has gotten through to you is the video at the very bottom of the sources.  It is by the Spanish researchers that were one of the groups to isolate GO in the jabs.  They suggest antioxidants.  I'm not a doctor so look into it more.  It makes logical sense that your body would classify GO as free radicals, so anything that aids your body in combating free radicals might be beneficial.  Heavy metal detoxs may also work but again, I'm not a doctor and I cannot tell you how to offset this.  But being aware that there is a problem is the first step to solving it.

I'm not writing this to try scare people.  I'm writing this because lots of my friends and family have decided to cave to coercion and undergo this procedure, and I feel duty-bound to warn you all about what you have done.  Don't stick your head in the sand about this.  Don't roll the dice with your life.  Don't entrust the future of your health to the most evil industry on the planet, an industry that directly profits from the continued sickness of mankind.  Governments all over the planet are indirectly forcing this upon all of us and there is a very obvious motive as to why such a global rollout is being undertaken.

I sincerely hope this all amounts to nothing and everyone really is ok.  But there is an enormous amount of evidence below that suggests otherwise.  I beg that you at least consider it.

Graphene Oxide poisoning causes the same symptoms of covid 19. Lung damage, blood clotting, loss of taste and smell and explain why many people which have recieved the covid vax report magnetism to metallic objects at the site of injection. 

I stumbled upon the research done by spanish researchers from la quinta columna https://stateofthenation.co/?p=70400 

Graphene oxide would have been introduced in high amounts in flu shots prior to 2020 which would have been taken by the elderly, for the most part. This explains why the elderly are more affected. 
Graphene oxide can be eliminated naturally by our bodies by glutathione, a powerful antioxidant which already decreases as we age. The younger one is, the higher the amounts of glutathione. It is also produced in great amounts during exercise which is why athletes have not been affected by covid and in most cases have had no symptoms. This is also why i believe the strict lockdowns were implemented which prevented many people from exercising and naturally producing glutathione. Yes many exercised outside, but many also previously relied on a gym to exercise and once those were closed they didn't exercise anymore.

Taking N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is the best way to dramatically increase glutathione. It is sold as a supplement. It is used in cough medicine as it is also effective in devreasing mucus along with its antioxidant properties and liver detoxification. 
The FDA is now in the process of banning NAC as a supplement and the timing is perfect. It expressed the intent to ban the substance in 2020, perfectly timed with the breakout of covid 19. https://fda.news/2020-08-21-fda-trying-make-n-acetylcysteine-illegal-could-help-treat-covid19.html#
Although i still found NAC on amazon it is now unavailable on myprotein where i had previously purchased it and many brands are now even disappearing from amazon. 

I also found this study https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30218681/ which indicates that graphene oxide inhibits spermatogenisis among other things. Depopulation. 
The spanish researchers also indicate the danger of having graphene oxide when the 5g network will be activated, lending to the idea of another 'pandemic' in a few years time when the grid will be activated and established. It essentially causes the famous cytokine storm you probably already heard about and basically makes the immune system useless. This time round deaths will be tremendous. This coincides with the Rockefeller foundation's 'Operation Lockstep' which has laid out the plan for what we see is happening currently. After the initial pandemic there would be a secondary one in which approximately 30% of people worldwide would die. 

Fun fact: the first province where 5g was rolled out was in Wuhan.

Google 'graphene oxide covid19"" and all you find are articles and studies promoting the nanoparticle and how it can help by being introduced in screening and vaccine. Red flag. 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32382315/
https://www.graphene-info.com/how-can-graphene-assist-war-coronavirus

The booster shots every year or multiple times a year would guarantee a high level of graphene oxide in the body and would not allow enough time for natural excretion of the nanoparticle by the body through antioxidative pathways. It is important to add that graphene oxide is present in all current vaccines, nasal spray vaccines and flu shots. So best bet is to forget about getting any kind of vaccination from now on.

2 this is 100% about **DIVIDE & CONQUER**\-to put a wedge in between people to prevent us uniting against them while they really start the fucking-inflation-you have seen NOTHING yet, if you have savings get into **physical** gold or silver, **NOT PAPER CONTRACTS FOR PHYSICAL METAL,** ONLY coins and bars you have at your home, or in a safety deposit box, more lockdowns are coming, and in my opinion the secondary reason for this-is so they can put the my body my choice to bed for mandatory vaxxes-and for those who think thats ok, do you realize that 2021 has the highest death rate for the USA EVER-not counting covid #s?

here are more #s if you need more proof

we need to unite against the gov, stand up for our rights, stop the ongoing democide-and put those responsible for it on trial for all to see.

we will never agree on everything, never-its impossible-but we need to unite on the things we do agree on, freedom of speech, freedom to travel, right to the pursuit of happiness, etc etc-this these are under heavy attack.

we need to take down freemason temples as they are the foot soliders, but also

""Hello People of Reddit. I bring to you... **FREEDOMGATE**

https://preview.redd.it/cnqa7ekwho351.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f0bc75ba648020723b1361ef24e76a7f21371e4

What is Freedom Gate?

Freedom Gate is my creation. Its basically an accumulation of videos and presentations I've put together to expose the ruling elite or new world order agenda on planet earth. I have dedicated my life to unraveling this concept to determine if its real or if its just a theory. I can conclusively tell you at the age of 26 that the new world order really does exist, evil people are controlling world affairs and everything that happens in our world benefits the 1% of the population and not the 99%. If we don't take action and do something soon they are going to take all our rights and freedoms away with this coronavirus outbreak by indicting martial law. They are just getting us use to the idea of a militarised police state but eventually it will become permanent. A totalitarian world government that only benefits the people at the top whilst the rest of us are tagged and quarantined with radio frequency identity tags to make us easier to control.

**THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE IS STRONGER THAN THE PEOPLE IN POWER.**

I have spent the last 2 years of my life putting solid, hardcore and factual information together that proves we have been lied to about all main historical events. What makes you think this coronavirus outbreak is any different? If we don't take action and stand up for ourselves were all screwed. Its the events of the past and action of our governments that have shaped the present. We must understand the events of the past if we are ever to understand why the world is the way it is today.

**THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW**

First watch my introductory video on freedomgate = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZj8JCgk0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZj8JCgk0o)

Freedom Gate is split into 7 categories:

**1 = PIZZAGATE**

**2 = THE 5G NETWORK IS THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER AGENDA**

**3 = TRUTHGATE**

**PART 1 = WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE NEWS**

**PART 2 = 911 (PARTS 1-3)**

**PART 3 = THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST**

**PART 4 = WHO REALLY CONTROLS THE WORLD**

**5 = IRISGATE**

**6= CORRUPTIONGATE**

**7 = MEDIAGATE**

Breakdown of my work available as PDF or videos.

**PIZZGATE**

Pizzagate is real. my presentations prove that there is enough evidence for law enforcement to open up an investigation. Please look at the material in your own time.

**CORRUPTIONGATE**

Corruptiongate is about what happened to me. I was framed by the police in the United Kingdom and Ireland because of how deep my research Is and the powerful people it exposed. This is why I have spent 2 years of my life compiling all this research. No one can come at me and called me a ""crazy conspiracy theorist', a ""tin foil hat head' or ""fake news"". My research is truthful, factual and legitimate. End of story. Im not going down without a fight. Everything I am doing is to prove my innocence. I will not stop until justice is served for myself and the human race. I will be releasing the videos very soon so they are in the public eye but for now my main attention is the manufactured pandemic which is the corona virus. We mustily unite, rise up and purge the evil from this world. ""videos soon to follow""

**MEDIAGATE**

Mediagate is about how the media will try and discredit my research and my story. The mainstream media is the biggest weapon of mass destruction because they poison our minds with propaganda and spin one sided narratives.

**EACH SECTION OF FREEDOMGATE IS LINKED WITH A COLOUR OF THE RAINBOW**

**PIZZAGATE = RED**

**5G-GATE = ORANGE**

**TRUTHGATE = YELLOW**

**ASCENSIONGATE = GREEN**

**IRISGATE = BLUE**

**CORRUPTIONGATE = INDIGO**

**MEDIAGATE = VIOLET**

When sharing or discussing these subjects wear the colour of the subject your most passionate about. If your passionate about the entirety of freedomgate and just want freedom and justice for the entire human race then wear colours of the rainbow.

I watched it live and it was pretty spot on. I am going to add the main takeaway points from my perspective. Please add yours if you watched it. And if you haven't watched it please do - link on vimeo at bottom

	1. The virus is a hoax
	2. When testing for this fake virus they are testing for genetic material we all have. They then control the ""curve"" by amplifying or reducing these results. Pretty much everyone tested will be positive because of this
	3. 5G is being installed while we are on lockdown
	4. 5G is dangerous. If set at 60Ghz it will starve your body of oxygen and you will die. 
	5. It can be directed from Elon Musks starlink too
	6. Lots of stuff about the Gates vaccination which I assume most of you know by now, including the digital currency and a chip which will govern what you can and can't do
	7. But hope at the end. Although he didn't state implicitly it was inferred that we rebel in our way. Read into that what you will. I know what I am doing 

Plenty more, but these are the main points for me

We are all in this together folks. Lets stay united

One world religion HQ opens next year. Pope Francis is a Jesuit, jesuits and black nobility, knights of Malta golden dawn OTO Freemasons Illuminati alumbrados etc, all the way back to the fall in the garden are the secret societies that follow after the fallen angels. You can see them throughout history. They aren’t aliens, they’re demons that have been here since the fall. Pleiadians/galactic federation of light/ashtar command/reptilians feed into the NEW AGE luciferian one world religion lie, project blue beam, intelligence agencies, are agencies of intelligence, occult “sciences” are taught and the Egyptian book of the dead is the oldest instance of recorded trauma based mind control. God has said, “there is nothing new under the sun,” and indeed there is not. Same thing different face. These alchemists, Rosicrucian hermeticists, these occultists have held the power in this world in generational satanic bloodlines and use the satanic “law” of do what thou wilt to uphold their position, and are possibly unknowingly deceived by the devils they follow, they are used as human puppets to carry out the devices of satan. Jesus already won on the cross. Before the flood the world was like ours today minus the technology, a one world government, led by the nephilim serpent seeded giants, and the devils, satan wants to corrupt our dna. Skull and bones 3 22, they want triple helix 66. That’s where transhumanism eugenics and Charles Darwin come in. Darwin was a mason. Don’t act surprised. Most influential figures were. They want to enter you into the hive mind system, make you a robot, control every aspect of your life. Pharmakeia is translated as sorcery and is also the Greek word that pharmaceuticals come from. Can’t you see? Occultism, black magic, witchcraft, it’s always been real. It’s harnessing the power of satan. It’s spiritual, physiological, psychological and otherwise means of unnatural and evil manipulation of a person and their God given free will. Satan is already damned. He hates you because he knows that Jesus blood on the cross paid the full price for you to be redeemed from sin and freed from his kingdom of darkness. Donald Trump is the antichrist I am 95% sure. Time is short. Concentration camps are built all over the world, mass morgues, armies, preparation for martial law, mass surveillance, an economic crash like the world has never seen that will replace all currency with digital currency in the beast system, and noahide laws are signed making it punishable be decapitation to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Only Jesus saves. Only He has paid the price for sin, and He will free all who come to Him by repentance and simple faith.


I could keep going on about this stuff in the world and send a hundred links, but the most important thing I can tell you is that TODAY is the day of salvation. Jesus Christ paid for YOUR sins on the cross so you don’t have to, He will save you if you come to Him and lay down your sins at His feet, not pretending to be without fault, He already died for you. God is love, and He is waiting for you to come to Him, but you must make the decision, it is the most important one you will ever make. God bless.

SS: Despite the obfuscation and media-slanted interpretation of claims made within, I'm posting because this is interesting and Woody seems like a straight-forward guy (his Tweets aren't currently showing up on my end, AT ALL, but it's my understanding he supported his claims with scientific studies and evidence and as the article indicates, is just one of many public figures coming out with their own concerns)

In a broader (even more interesting) sense...

Woody's dad is implicated in many theories by established researchers RE: JFK Assassination, as his father was [Charles Voyde Harrelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Harrelson), who was an American organized crime figure who was convicted of assassinating federal judge John H. Wood Jr., the first federal judge to have been killed in the 20th century. He is implicated in an explosive claim in the documentary **JFK to 9/11: Everything is a Rich Man's Trick** (used to be on YT, definitely accessible on bitchute and it is worth every second of its 3hr 30 minute runtime).

I highly recommend that documentary to my peers here as its very useful to suss out the common repeated strategies of TPTB through time to manipulate and exploit the masses which is a central repeated theme (and we're dealing with today in a different context).",conspiracy,5G
100,State Of California,213.0,dpeckd,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dpeckd/state_of_california/,158.0,1572475836.0,"Hey Guys, 

This isn't really anything regarding a conspiracy just want to express what I am seeing and experiencing going on with California right now. 

First, these fires. These fires are nuts, it seems every week there is a fire going on. There was the Lake Balboa fire, the Getty Fire, Fire in Santa Clarita, Moorpark. The Santa Ana winds have been going for a week or two and we have already had more than 5 fires. It is definitely taking a toll on us as far as air quality and just a frequency as humans. It is exhausting to be honest. Personally, I feel California is no longer the place to live. Don't get me wrong it's dope, but the cost of living is so ridiculous and everything is so expensive. In Santa Monica people are paying $2400 for a one bedroom near the beach. People renting houses in the valley for $3500. It's going to be very difficult for people to own houses or anything especially as we are taught to enjoy the moment and not save. 

Second, as we can stay on housing is these 5g towers. They're everywhere, huge towers, and people are not batting an eye. There have been no studies regarding these towers that are putting out a powerful frequency, and being ""electric"" humans, these things are definitely going to take its toll. Towers in the poorer part of town right next to apartments, schools. Mix these towers with poor nutrition, stress, bodies are going to break down, and thats what they do, these strong currents destroy cells. So like always it looks like the poorer with be affected first just because they don't have the education towards proper nutrition and what it means to take care of themselves and family as a whole. The crazy part is, I'm driving in some of the richest parts in LA and these towers are placed right outside of peoples homes right on their telephone poles. In Malibu, Laurel Canyon, Pacific Palisades. Literally, million dollars homes where they're 5G receptors right outside of peoples windows. It blows my mind that people are allowing this to go on in their neighborhood. Homes worth millions and there is a 5g post right outside. I am blown away every time I see it. 

Thirdly, the state of the people. Everyone is in a rate race like I'm sure everywhere else across the country is. I train kids in baseball at a little league in a very wealthy area, let me tell you what I'm seeing as far as the rich and the poor. Very rarely do I see a parent who is on top of their kid  parenting. The kid is either a brat, talking to his parents in a way he shouldn't be, or the kids have no athletic ability because they do not play outside anymore and the parents are working to much to play with them. Social media, the phone, and all the screens have truly taken over. Kids are so programmed to the music, the fortnight, that they are becoming programmed by these devices and their parents are not batting an eye because majority are just a programmed as them. 

Now this is what I see with the poorer kids.  Im hispanic, and my latino community is getting DESTROYED. One of the biggest things I see destroying my latino community is obesity. I walk by a local high school, mainly latino, and every kid is overweight. Most girl have developed way to early due to the food. The LAUSD school system is a joke, down to the breakfast they give you every morning. Girls have boobs, the young men have boobs. It is breaking my heart. The young Latin men feel like they have nothing to loose. No one is showing them the way to think bigger, to do this and not do that, and it is not just the hispanics but the poorer class as a whole. No one cares about them, and these programs do some mediocre stuff that does not connect with them at all. 

In conclusion, people need to understand that we are not humans having a spiritual journey. Rather we are spiritual beings having a human experience. That is the stuff they don't want to tell you. So, they control you with the screens, the food, the entertainment, the alcohol, the drugs.  Turn all that shit off, it's fake! I use to watch sports, but more and more as I watch it I realize this shit is fake too. So many players making a good play and then throwing up the devil horns with the thumb out or making the 666 with their hands.  Athletes, artists, sports, its all a distraction to keep us occupied. Wake up, turn off the TV, spend time with the wife and kids, take the devices away from the kids because that stuff is designed to be addicting and it is happening. One of the best things I've done recently is stop watching porn and practicing semen retention. Im not crazy with it, but even if I go a week I feel so clear and focused. Men, stop watching porn you will feel a lot better I guarantee it. The world is crazy out there, but be a role model, a light, turn off the screens and Live! 

Thank you guys, this thing is everywhere especially the porn but I hope I got off some good points.",conspiracy,5G
101,"This night the military came to detain a 65 year old monk who is one of the most controversial persons in Russia. He claimed that “Covid19” is fake, said that Bill Gates is fascist, said that Putin and Patriarch Kirill all of them serve the Zionist agenda. More info bellow.",208.0,km65zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/km65zw/this_night_the_military_came_to_detain_a_65_year/,50.0,1609212931.0,"So in this [**LINK**](https://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-69666906.html) there is an explanation regarding the incident. It is in Russian but there are photos and videos. Here is what is going on.

**Father Sergey is a monk** who built few monasteries, a hospital and a school for orphanages. In this monastery complex there are around 500 nuns, some monks and dozens of children and lay people. He was the only one of the Russian Church who was speaking out and warning people about what’s coming.

**The military invaded** the monastery complex after midnight, beating the nuns and some of the monks. One nun has a broken hip and there are others injured. The military is holding the nuns and children outside in the freezing temperatures and is not planning to let them in their homes.

**So why are the communists doing this?** Because thousands of people are coming to this place all over Russia and many people are finding out the truth.

**Father Sergey on 5G:**

>**5G technology and human chipping are not only related, they are similar. These are new creations of the Jewish Masons, a single global project for total control over people to build an electronic camp of Satan. ... Modern 5G technologies make it possible to form the 3rd DNA helix, which will be formed under the influence of 5G rays from nanoparticles that have already contaminated our body. … The emergence of the 3rd DNA helix will make it possible to maximally influence the consciousness and subconsciousness of people, to control their behavior,… to influence it from the immoral side.**

**He became widely known** throughout Russia with his harsh statement, where he denied the reality of the “covid19” coronavirus pandemic, while heavily criticizing the Patriarch, the Bishops and the President for allowing the churches to be closed and he called them names like servants of the Zionist agenda, Masons...

After that the Church authorities said that he no longer belongs to the Church because he “violated” laws. But if this isn’t true what he said why then nobody came out publicly and said it? They were just shooting themselves in the foot.

**During this period** the monastery was posting videos from various channels on the social networks from their Sunday services where thousands would attend and from his preaching and warnings to the government because if they dont repent, a heavy judgment is going to come for them.

Then, he published a video message claiming that the population is being ""chipped"" under the guise of a “covid-19” vaccine under the leadership of Bill Gates. Father Sergey called Gates a ""fascist"" and offered to judge him like Hitler. He said that the head of Sberbank German Gref to be the conductor of Gates' ideas in Russia.

His most important message was after this Sunday service:

>**Ive heard Rosgvardia wants to come...I have long been waiting for the army, and the navy, and heavenly helicopters, airplanes, even the special forces, even all this host of the world behind the scenes, let them come, we will meet her with dignity. I have a base here, (...) I have a spiritual base, let them try to fight our monastery with spiritual might. This will be your first lesson in your defeat.**

The authorities warned them not to call the media(because obviously they would see that this is just normal monastery) but they called them on purpose so they can show to the whole Russia what is going on and how Putin and Kirill are persecuting women and children.

From now on, Russia wont be the same. Russia will rise, there is strong opposition even in the army. They don’t need another communist Russia. Father Sergey said that very soon a Russian Tsar will come and eliminate all Zionists!

I have spent, ultimately, at least a hundred hours or more reading up about this stuff over the last year because it seems like the most significant event in my short life, and have shared nearly every peer reviewed study, well-sourced article, and occasionally a particularly interesting video [such as from Veritas] regarding it with at least some people I know- but ultimately I never really thought anyone in my life would be affected. 

I've had friends who complained of ""brain fog"" or increased anxiety and depression/lethargy after the shots, but nothing serious.

Well turns out in addition to my mother, two direct friends and two friends-or-relatives-of-friends who have had ""mild issues"" yesterday I found out that a current business partner of ours died of a heart attack two days after her booster at 42. It's not unheard of, of course, but she was active and healthy and had not [according to her husband] had any previous health issues.  

Then today I found out why one of our employees [daughter of a friend] has been out of commission for nearly 4 weeks after having Cv19 for the first time. She, at 28, got her V as soon as she recovered -I'm sure she was told it was the right thing to do- and has been out for an additional ~two and a half weeks with ""health problems"" since then. We have no V requirements, she chose it on her own. No idea what exactly is going on.

Just now, [same day, later from the last, from a different source] I found out that one of my partner's cousins has passed in the hospital at 24 [younger than I am!] less than a week after having ~~her booster~~ [was wrong, it was her second shot, asked my partner about it. She had some issues with the first shot but ""nothing serious""]. She is diabetic and was recommended it, even though she caught C19 in '20 and was fine. Don't know yet what they say the cause was. 

I am just messed up right now. I knew that side effects could happen and that's why I didn't get it for myself [also because I don't fkn need it] but realistically I never thought anything would happen to anyone I know. I thought it was ""rare"". It's supposed to be rare. IDK about all that graphene oxide 5g shit, but there is something wrong with this.. I have tried talking to several people I know and it's mostly only other people who have had this happen to people they know that are willing to hear me.

For the love of god, I hope nobody I know puts it in their kids. I might actually explode if something bad happened to a kid I know. 

""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"" has never seemed more true to me. I just don't know what to do.

https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/


I’m currently reading through them and trying to find which ones seem nefarious, suspicious, or important. These are the ones that stood out to me thus far, I have included links and a brief summary:

[Better Cybercrime Metrics Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/s2629/summary)-This bill establishes various requirements to improve the collection of data related to cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime. This one stood out to me, because of the DHS releasing that official bulletin that says “Covid conspiracy theorists” are now considered [domestic terrorists](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system). This bill vaguely alludes to Covid “misinformation” as cybercrime. 


[COMPETES ACT](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr4521/summary)- This Bill is GIANT. It would be easier to list the things NOT included in this Bill. It took me about 20 minutes to read through the index itself. Things that caught my eye in this bill were many different topics in regard to China, the Uyghurs, digital identity research, biometrics research, quantum information science, artificial intelligence, clean energy programs, advanced nuclear research, cannabis and hemp, blockchain and cryptocurrency, more cyber security and communications, 5G, supply chain monitoring systems and stockpiles, reports on Covid origin and management, vaccines,  national biodefense strategy, “Using climate diplomacy to better serve national security and economic interests”, human trafficking, propaganda and more. 


[MORE ACT](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr3617/summary)- The decriminalization of marijuana. There were mentions of cannabis and hemp in the COMPETE act as well. It would really suck if these distractions were to stop us from noticing it DOESN’T pass. Would be cool if it does. Lots of innocent people in jail for petty marijuana crimes.

Again. We let them control a narrative across the entire world, again. How could we let this happen? How could we be so blind as to not see this coming? 

More surveillance. More control. More devaluation of the dollar. We have citizens literally yelling, ""Flatten the curve!!"" at other citizens when, just a few months ago no one had heard that statement before. It wasn't in our vocabulary. Now, it's a world wide catch phrase. Neighbors are watching neighbors. People are paranoid. They don't know what to believe or who to listen to anymore.

We've been had. I have to give it to TPTB honestly, they really know how to shut down anything they see fit. The saddest part is? This didn't happen overnight. This was a slow burn. They were patient. They were diligent in a plan to get the world to once again, give up rights for more surveillance. It was THAT easy.

Regardless if you think this virus is as deadly as it sounds - it doesn't matter - what matters is the aftermath of everything. You should be more thoughtful of what the future holds for everyone. 

We are already being programmed by news segments about, ""Get ready for the new norm"" - and what is the new norm you may ask? https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615370/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-18-months/ < Already talking about it. Already putting it in people's minds slowly but surely.

They needed a way to put boots on the ground here to get people used to the idea of it. To get people comfortable with it. NOW you have people literally THANKING the government for doing such things. Setting up checkpoints. Going door to door. They really made this happen. People really have no idea what they're asking for because the government, once again, got people to trade freedom for surveillance and control. 

May peace be with you in the future. No one knows truly what is written in stone for us but we already have a good idea of it. Cashless society. ID2020. 5G for easier tracking. I really really hope...that some how most of us are wrong about our future. I really do. Here's to hoping and keeping that hope alive.

This is hardcore science. The guy talks real quick and the slides are presented real quick, making it hard to keep up.

But I think it will be worth it if it's something that interests you.

What's the conspiracy?

There are numerous ways to affect vibrations within the brain.

There are also vast amounts of study that prove beyond a doubt that healthy food is necessary for proper brain functioning.

Some of us here believe TPTB have a plan to reduce the population and maintain it at a certain number.

Some of us here are pretty sure we're observing increasing signs of mental instability among the general population.

The conspiracy - Some of us here don't think it's an accident or unexplainable phenomenon.

I'm going to have to do way more research on this (this is the first I've heard of the ""Orch OR"" theory ""orchestrated objective reduction"") to see if the vibrations of the microtubules can be affected by devices such as cellphones or 4G and 5G networks.

I'm not going to be surprised if they do. It's pretty difficult for me to dismiss certain parallels between the increase of digital transmissions and mental instability among the general population.

As I said before, diet is probably a very significant factor in the overall equation.

Also, I would like to restate that it always seems to come back to vibrations.

The studies this guy and his partners are conducting ask a good question - Does consciousness exist ""before"" life?

Anyone familiar with Schumann's Resonances probably has a better understanding of why this is possible.

Hope you enjoy the journey.

Edit: At 26:50 you can hear a recording of these microtubules vibrating ""within the brain""...holy crap.

Edit: Double bonus for those of you who are interested in the effects of DMT, LSD, mushrooms etc...apparently these help drive consciousness ""farther down"" into the quantum level. Very interesting stuff.

For those of you who suffer from depression...there are new techniques using non-invasive ultrasound therapy that may be promising.

That having been said – I believe that now is the time for me to quit this place. Let me explain why.  

One, this place is no longer a place for the [**TRUTH**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fld65g/feeling_something_off_about_reality_lately_heres/). For instead of killing this sub *openly,* Reddit has decided to take the route of [**infiltrating and infesting the whole place**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g415w5/meta_the_supposedly_massive_nationwide/) using [**agents of darkness**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4soy5/reddit_doing_anything_and_everything_to_push_the/) and [**messages of hopelessness**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fn42lr/is_anyone_else_just_in_complete_disbelief_that/). From [**outright mockery**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fwhj1n/theres_an_increasing_amount_of_people_on_this_sub/) and [**openly encouraged shilling**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g54qcx/i_think_i_discovered_a_conspiracy_to_game_reddit/) to [**obvious gaslighting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5900c/this_community_is_infested_with_shills_trolls_and/) and [**not-so-obvious deceptions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ywa9/an_account_created_exactly_12_hours_ago_makes_a/), the elite-puppet Reddit has been using [**the** ***exact*** **same tools**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4sisf/just_in_case_you_still_havent_figured_it_out/) that have by been recklessly (ab)used and overused beyond all recognition now by the *“utterly reliable”* [**mainstream media**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ts3q/using_propaganda_to_shape_public_perceptions_of/) that just about everyone **so mindlessly** believes in.  

But if only that was all. For you see, when mods start deleting **THE TRUTH** because the [**text was emboldened**]( https://i.imgur.com/LX3cifW.png) or because someone dared to commit the unspeakable atrocity that is [**using emojis correctly**]( https://i.imgur.com/uF6QkSQ.png); but don’t apply the same standards to shills and bots – to the extent that [**everyone starts saying this stuff**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g55m11/extremely_disappointed_this_is_the_end_of/); you know that your time for hanging out in this sub looking for TRUTHS is up for sure. I mean, I’ve literally gotten modmails at this point asking me “not to call anyone a shill” (even if you have proof) and “not to name or call out shills openly (even if it is WITH EVIDENCE), or **RISK GETTING BANNED.** I mean, is this even a TRUTH SUB at this point?  

But there’s a far bigger concern that I wish to address here -- and that one has a helluva lot to do with *introspection.* For you see, like I said earlier, the more that one focuses upon negative realities, argues with people, gets mad, gets fearful, gets angry, and overall becomes agitated and negative -- the EASIER it is for them to attract the **EXACT NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES** that they were so diligently looking to avoid (by spreading truths) to begin with. If “what you focus on, you attract” is true (and experience has indeed taught me that such is so) -- then my coming here and arguing and fighting those-of-lesser-light only serves THEIR cause. Entering into a mud puddle to wrestle a pig doesn’t get the pig dirty, but it sure does get YOU dirty (and the pig just *loves it* anyways) Besides, by going near a pig to begin with, the **pig** never gets *uplifted* -- but **you** most certainly do come down to *their low level of existence*. And [**I’m not even the only one**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g2kvfm/take_a_break_from_conspiracy_if_you_need_it/) who has started seeing this **TRUTH** *so very clearly now.*  

Guys, let me make it real simple for you all. The *time window* for spiritually awakening and CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSING one’s desired timeline of choice (be it positive or negative) has been open for quite some time now, however, it is *fast closing now* even as we speak. Our job, as beacons of truth and LIGHT, was to assist in dropping and seeding just enough TRUTHS and HINTS for the masses to DO THE RESEARCH FOR THEMSELVES and **WAKE THE FUCK UP.** However, the time for assisting others is **now PAST** – and now – it is *about time* that we focused on our creating *OWN positive reality manifestations*. (Remember what they say in flight safety announcements here, “Secure your own mask *first,* before even as much as *thinking* of assisting *others* with *their masks*.”) Else, we would **for sure be left here** (within these negative timelines) to rot -- and that too for *ages to come*, WITHOUT any faults of our own whatsoever. We have seeded enough truths within the mass collective consciousness (and these subreddits etc.) for the people to find and learn from; and now, it is about time that we all moved up into the next level of (higher) existence, once and for all. It sounds harsh – I know – but then again, **everyone’s had their shot at awakening**. If all of them are **still unable to** spot the TRUTH *despite it parading* [**butt-naked right in front of them**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g46rbn/i_feel_this_life/) – well, they have made their *choice*, and all choices come with their respective [**consequences**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g53a9w/source_theorists_the_governments_have_already/). And so it is. And so it is.  

To conclude, [**arguments no longer serve us**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4zeyq/a_reminder_for_anyone_who_is_having_trouble/), [**wise words such as these**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4h3ru/it_is_the_mark_of_an_educated_mind_to_be_able_to/) aren’t “cool

Original Post 

After constantly seeing people talking about how these towers are actually microwave transponders and reading through the diff types of effects they have on people, I walked up to one by my home and I completely agree. Those things look extremely suspect. Also on the bottom of the tower there was a huge vented generator releasing some type of exhaust. The sound was exactly like the sound a household microwave makes while active, but obviously much louder. It seemed as if the generator was offloading the excess energy(?) or heat of the system. Just got total bad vibes around the thing.",conspiracy,5G

Remember all those protests/riots in 2019? People *are* waking up to the illusion we've all been living - but that doesn't mean that we're all ready to grab our pitchforks. Waking up could be as simple as questioning why insulin is 10 times cheaper in a different country. It's the general mindset of questioning why things are the way they are, (and if there's only one way to do them), that is waking up. 

That being said, the virus has showed us that the vast majority are still asleep. Could be unfair as everyone's stressed atm, but the media most definitely still pulls the strings. But - some of us are awake, and that number has been steadily growing for a while. Conspiracy is no longer taboo in casual conversation, Epstein was a mainstream meme, hell, this sub got over a million members last year. I'm thinking this small group of people got our owners a little anxious.

See, we've always had owners. Kings, pharaohs, emperors, presidents, whatever. Since the dawn of civilization there have been haves, and have nots. The 'haves' use the 'have nots' to favour their interests - whatever they may be. Worship me, attack my enemies, make me rich. They control us, they always have.

But in the modern age the internet came along, and they had to get clever. Propaganda is incredibly effective in the 21st century. What's so incredible about it is how many forms it takes, it's everywhere. They have a very clever and watertight system that keeps everyone content, docile and in line. Not everyone is buying the illusion though, they left us clues. And slowly, but surely, we started picking up on these clues. Some saw the illusion early, others late. Not all of us belived the evidence, we disagreed, but we all saw the world for what it is. 

Our owners are going to make sure that we never question things again. I believe this virus is all about control. We're mostly agreed that it's artificial, and now we have ID2020, 5G, EARN IT, Pelosi to look forward to. These programs are all about control, and the virus is the perfect excuse to activate them. This is happening right now, they're playing their ace. 

We all feel something is up with this whole virus situation, normies and foil hatters alike. Remember 9/11? These people are vicious to maintain their control. We cheered as troops invaded Iraq to fight the threat of nuclear attack, until we found out there were no nukes. People are cheering now going into 'quarantine' which is looking more and more like martial law each day. 

Idk, I just think we're getting changes we won't be coming back from. But hey, jm2c.",conspiracy,5G

>**2010, August 28** • Google, CIA Invest in 'Future' of Web Monitoring.      
The investment arms of the CIA and Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time – and says it uses that information to predict the future.     
The company is called Recorded Future, and it scours tens of thousands of websites, blogs and Twitter accounts to find the relationships between people, organizations, actions and incidents – both present and still-to-come. In a white paper, the company says its temporal analytics engine ""goes beyond search"" by ""looking at the 'invisible links' between documents that talk about the same, or related, entities and events.""    
The idea is to figure out for each incident who was involved, where it happened and when it might go down. Recorded Future then plots that chatter, showing online ""momentum"" for any given event.    
""The cool thing is, you can actually predict the curve, in many cases,"" says company CEO Christopher Ahlberg, a former Swedish Army Ranger with a PhD in computer science. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2010/07/exclusive-google-cia/)    

That's so amazing isn’t it? You can actually **predict the curve**. Well now, let's think, were have we seen that curve terminology before? Population Curve? Nope, that's not right. Curve Your Enthusiasm? That doesn't sound right either. Right, it's Curb Your Enthusiasm. Duh. The Learning Curve? Ugh. I just can't remember, can you? Oh shoot, that's right, it's the **Title of My Post's, Flatten the Curve**. Ok. Moving on. Let's get back to Recorded Future.    

>Occupy Wall Street Media Monitoring • 
In 2011, Recorded Future reported, ""... gaining online momentum for the Occupy Wall Street movement. When we look more carefully at influencers in this discussion using our Influencer Map, we find that Iran Press TV is the second largest influencer after the U.S. media!"" [Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_Future)      

Recorded Future saw online momentum for the Occupy Wall Street Movement. But. But. Does that mean they knew the social discord was going to lead to today's riots? Could they be manipulating police to follow orders without fear of repercussions for the future? 
Nah. They couldn't have, otherwise police officers wouldn't be going to go jail after violating a citizens rights, right? 

>**2020, June 22** • Police in America’s biggest cities are failing to meet even the most basic international human rights standards governing the use of lethal force, a new study from the University of Chicago has found.    
Researchers in the university’s law school put the lethal use-of-force policies of police in the 20 largest US cities under the microscope. They found not a single police department was operating under guidelines that are compliant with the minimum standards laid out under international human rights laws.   
Among the failings identified by the law scholars, some police forces violate the requirement that lethal force should only be wielded when facing an immediate threat and as a last resort. Some departments allow deadly responses in cases of “escaping suspects”, “fugitives”, or “prevention of crime” – all scenarios that would be deemed to fall well outside the boundaries set by international law.
Top UN human rights expert urges US to listen to demands of protesters.   
In other cities, police guidelines failed to constrain officers to use only as much force as is proportionate to the threat confronting them.   
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/us-police-human-rights-standards-report)   

Hmmm. Maybe the militarization of our police is starting to make a lot more sense now, doesn’t it? It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy to know that pretty soon that same police force will be able to track you anywhere.

It's great that you've got so much new household hardware connected to the internet. Especially for the CIA, whose director wants to spy on you through it.      
More and more personal and household devices are connecting to the internet, from your television to your car navigation systems to your light switches. CIA Director David Petraeus cannot wait to spy on you through them. [SOURCE HERE](https://www.wired.com/2012/03/petraeus-tv-remote/)    

What's David Petraeus talking about? The Internet of Things. That same Internet of Things that 5G is being rushed out for. That same Internet of Things that will help usher in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. That same 4th Revolution that the World Economic Forum is calling the Great Reset. Perfect Plan. Crisis. Crap your pants. Solution. If you think the Surveillance State is omnipresent now, just wait until the infrastructure is built for the next level of control. For our safety, of course. Keep Calm and Carry On. The Not Normal New Normal is going to be very dangerous. And to save us from the Not Normal New Normal they have to keep us safe from Fake News with Fact Checks. **Wash Your Hands and Wear Your Mask**. Keep your Contact Tracer App Up to Date.

>**September 2, 2020** • Although the coronavirus pandemic has altered how people live for some time now, the knowledge that it will have an end is a faint light at the end of a long socially distanced tunnel. But, according to new research, that light may be further than we thought. Infectious disease expert and coronavirus task force voice of reason Anthony Fauci believes we may be entering a “pandemic era.” Because of course we are. [Source Here](https://www.mic.com/p/dr-fauci-said-were-entering-a-pandemic-age-what-does-that-mean-33006509)      

The Pandemic Era. Line up and get shot, errr, sorry, I meant, line up and get your shots. Don't be an antivaxer. **Save Civilization, Get Your Vaccination**. Remember, we won't have a second wave, it will just be one long continuous wave. Wait. Hold up. Nope. That's wrong. We are having a second wave. Surf's up so don't wipe out.     

>His assertion comes from a new report in the scientific journal Cell, whose author David Morens, a medical historian and colleague of Fauci’s at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicts that coronavirus might be only the first of a series of worldwide diseases. These types of diseases have been cropping up more and more frequently, according to research. **The phenomenon is similar to the exponential growth of climate change, meaning if a “pandemic age,” becomes a reality, it joins humanity’s very real race to doomsday**. Neat!     

Ah. The Pandemic Era and Environmental Collapse. Amazing! It's the sequel that we've been waiting for! Mad Max and Pandemic Road.   And who is causing the upcoming doom? Why us, who else. You see, the enemy isn't at the gates, that Trojan Horse was yesterday's news. The Terrorists that were threatening Western Civilization have been beaten back, only to be replaced by an enemy that can't be seen or heard. The Biological Terrorists. And how are we responsible for the Great Bioterror that needs a Great Reset?

>As for the culprit to this acceleration? It’s us, of course. For how humans are causing this acceleration, Fauci and Morens point to deforestation, urban crowding, and wet markets for wild game, which have been wreaking havoc for a century and contribute to environmental degradation around the world.    

Us. It's always us. We don't listen. We just Keep Calm and Carry On. But now we're going to have to listen. We won't have any choice, will we? The environment is collapsing. It's our fault. We own the companies. We package small items in big boxes because, marketing. We dump toxic chemical waste that poison people. We make cellphones that are outdated in one year. We're the one's lying about plastic being recycled. What? You actually thought you were doing your part and saving the environment?   

>**2020, September, 21** • The industry's awareness that recycling wouldn't keep plastic out of landfills and the environment dates to the program's earliest days, [NPR] found. ""There is serious doubt that [recycling plastic] can ever be made viable on an economic basis,"" one industry insider wrote in a 1974 speech.
Yet the industry spent millions telling people to recycle, because, as one former top industry insider told NPR, selling recycling sold plastic, even if it wasn't true.       
Here's the basic problem: All used plastic can be turned into new things, but picking it up, sorting it out and melting it down is expensive. Plastic also degrades each time it is reused, meaning it can't be reused more than once or twice.    
On the other hand, new plastic is cheap. It's made from oil and gas, and it's almost always less expensive and of better quality to just start fresh.    
**As it turns out, less than 10% of plastic has ever been recycled**. 

####Ever.

It's us.. We demand these things. What? Does that shock you? Of course that's why they make our goods disposable, the public demands it. It's not like marketing works and the demand is a manufactured need to increase their profits. Nope. It's us. Our existence is killing the planet. This wouldn't be happening if there weren't so many of us. Because this is obviously the first extinction level event that could be happening because of abrupt climate change.

And didn't I say that it was cyanobacteria because I saw a pond that looked like it was outgassing hydrogen sulfide gas in a video I linked to? Yes, yes I did. And guess what? The Greek was right.   

>More than 300 elephants in Botswana have been killed by toxin-producing cyanobacteria in waterholes, government wildlife officials said Monday. But that explanation doesn't satisfy some conservationists.   
The deaths, which took place over the course of three months, were first recorded in May and reported in early July. Their cause was initially a mystery; Botswana ordered laboratory tests to be carried out on carcass, soil and water samples as speculation grew over the deaths.
Cyanobacteria are routinely found in water, but not all produce toxins. **Scientists worry that climate change will trigger the bacteria to produce more toxins** as water temperatures rise and conditions become more favorable for the bacteria to grow. [Source Here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/21/africa/botswana-elephant-deaths-intl/index.html)   

That doesn't satisfy some conservationists? Really? Worldwide reports of a rotten egg smell. Dogs dying when they jump into cyanobacteria filled waters. Rivers turning red. Nah. The New Normal is our New Normal, until AI turns it into our New New Normal. 


>**Pax Technica** • What is the internet of things? This pax will not be dominated by any one state, Howard argues, but by “a special kind of stability in global politics, revealing a pact between big technology firms and government”. The categories of democracy and dictatorship will fall. In their place, he claims, will be data-driven socio-technocracies, built on the intensive reporting of our behaviours, habits, tastes and beliefs, seamlessly transmitted by the devices we use, carry and interact with. We won’t need to express our political preferences and needs: our white goods and driverless cars will express them for us. [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/15/internet-of-things-mass-surveillance)    
By tracking us in intensive and intrusive ways – not only in our homes, but in our vehicles and bodies – **data-driven devices can nudge, manipulate and mould our behaviours**, habits and preferences, limit our autonomy, and bring quantification, segregation and discrimination to what is currently a political economy held together by social fuzziness.       

They'll be able to shape and modify our behavior. And when you put Recorded Future and other companies into the mix, guess what happens? They'll shape and modify our behaviours before they become our behaviours, because they'll already know how we'll behave in the future. Kind of like the shaming of antivaxer behavior before they announce:

[Source Here](https://www.recode.net/ad/18027288/ai-sustainability-environment)     

Do you see where all this is going? The AI and IoT will be everywhere. It will save us from the Collapse, which really means, it will save us from ourselves. Do you see the convergence that's taking place? No? Let me remind you. Because if we are the problem, then we aren't alone. 

>Coronavirus which is killing and infecting people all over the world was created in a Lab in China's Wuhan, such an idea would have been labelled a conspiracy theory until a few weeks ago.     
But earlier this week, a Chinese virologist Dr Li-Meng Yan, in an exclusive conversation with WION claimed that the deadly coronavirus was developed in a government laboratory in Wuhan. She also said that Chinese government was aware of the COVID-19 spread.    
And now Professor Giuseppe Tritto, an internationally known expert in biotechnology and nanotechnology in his book 'China COVID 19: The chimera that changed the world' has said that he believes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is behind the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), leaving little doubt that this viral “chimera” was artificially created as a bioweapon.

We're going to war against China, while they get the security apparatus up for AI in the war against our minds and individuality. For an environmental collapse they blame us for. And they will focus our shame into anger towards  China.      

The system will be set up. We will go to war with China. And the system will be fully executed by the time the war is done. It will have to be, for our safety, of course. And AI will keep us safe. Right? **RIGHT!** Wait. So then why are all the elite building Doomsday Bunkers? Almost like the 1% are covering their bases in case AI can't save us.   

>One of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality. Being denied what you have seen. Being denied what you have experienced and know to be true. It can make you feel like you are crazy. But you are not crazy.   
Dr Robin Stern, associate director at Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of The Gaslight Effect says that usually “when people are abused there are signs that you can point to that are much more obvious. Someone who has been hit or threatened for instance – it’s easy to see and understand how they have been hurt. **But when someone is manipulating you, you end up second-guessing yourself and turning your attention to yourself as the person to blame**”. [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/16/gaslighting-manipulation-reality-coping-mechanisms-trump)    


DARVO - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Or, Gaslighting. It's a popular term. It's a great way to make us feel like powerless victims. Gaslighting makes us feel like we need to be saved. When you're searching for answers but only end up finding confusion, it's setting you up to accept any New Normal answer they'll eventually give you. Need someone to blame for the state of chaos? Here's China. They're the problem. **We're All In This Together, and You're Either With Us Or Against Us**. And there will be people against the war, and therefore against us, so we'll need surveillance to protect us from the enemies within. Because another War will be a necessary evil. World War Three will be the War to save the planet by destroying the planet. Makes sense, doesn't it? And when our planet is worse off than before? Then we'll need the surveillance to help us decide when to have Climate and Pandemic lockdowns. The omnipresent Eye of AI will guide us and safeguard us against Fake News and Not Normal New Normal Narrative disrupting lies. We will have to kill what's left of our privacy because dangerous thoughts are born in secrecy. 

We must become a transparent society, because the truth doesn't need to hide. The truth is universal. But who decides what is true? Not us. We can't be trusted. Look what we already did with our privacy, we destroyed our planet. So we have to become dependent upon the system and trust the choices that the system makes. We can't just follow system orders though, we have to become a part of the system, a unified whole working towards the common good of all mankind. But what happens when you question the choices? What happens if your thoughts and actions disrupt the Not Normal New Normal Narrative?   

Let's check back with David Petraeus a year later after openly musing about how the IoT will make surveillance ubiquitous in our society.

After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.""
>>**2012, November 11 • How I Was Drawn Into the Cult of David Petraeus**. The biggest irony surrounding CIA director David Petraeus’ downfall is becoming a casualty of the very publicity machine he cultivated to portray him as superhuman. I have some insight into how that machine worked. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/petraeus-cult-2/)    
>>>**2020, November 15 • Now the CIA Is Investigating Petraeus**. Anyone who thought the scandal around CIA Director David Petraeus was winding down can think again. Now the CIA is investigating its former leader while some agency veterans whisper that they never liked him anyways. [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/cia-investigates-petraeus/)    

Oops. I think David said something that he shouldn't have said about IoT and Surveillance. It's a quick fall from Superhero To Villan when you reveal the Superhero Clubhouse Secrets.    


Look. Listen. Think. Question. All the time. The information is out there. So's the truth, even if it's camouflaged. Because the truth is, the big picture is a lot more complicated than thought reducing and behavioral shaping memes. Life isn't black and white. That's why they call it a Grey War. And the Grey War is happening all around us. And in the coming weeks I'll be posting some eye opening stories about the Dark Web, Blockchain, and the current narrative about inequality. About a certain pharmaceutical company and how it's DNA  tests are failing the grade. We will dive into the Uighur Minority in China. And most importantly, Cicada 3301, and how it seems to be playing a larger role than most of us realize. And some updates on the current microbial imbalance that is starting to cause havoc on our planets environment. And as if that isn't enough for eye opening revelations, there is a disturbing trend that I've noticed regarding asteroids and impacts. Because why not, after all, 2020 isn't a real party until a Rockstar crashes the party. 

I may have been too tired to post lately, but I wasn't too tired to read. Thanks again for all the comments and PM's checking in on me. It meant the world to me, even if I didn't have time to respond.

Also, if someone tried to disprove me with a map of the COVID-19 cases and where 5G towers are set up, it can also be compared with the locations of subways, the KKK, gonorrhea, and hair restoration centers. The reason why they are similar is because of the population. The higher the population, the more internet towers need to be set up.

I am not an usual poster here, but I confess I am reading what have been posted here for some time. I like to investigate and I like to know as much as I can what is going on around me. I am a fighter, I am not a sheeple.  

I tried to post this on many other subs, forums, social media and it was downvoted to oblivion, removed, banned, ridiculed etc... you know the tactics to suppress the critical thinking, open mind and voice against tyranny. I think is a general feeling that this sub r/Conspiracy is the last place where we can still say what we have to say, in special in these hard moments that the whole planet is going through. And I think is also a tactic, they let us post here so it could be easy considered ""crazy bat shit conspiracy nut"". I am ok with that as far as I know that many other thinkers can read what am I about to say.  

**Thank you mods of r/conspiracy to let us say what we have to say.**  

So let's have a ""factcheck"" of the latest points of the greatest conspiracy of the all times: New World Order is about to take over, the End Game that we all know about that will come and we warned about.  
In a conspiracy, to prove it that is real and not a conspiracy anymore we need to answer 4 questions: who, why, how, when

1. **Who: Rothschild, Rockefeller, cabals** etc   
It was posted here so many links, documents, videos, confessions about these, we already know WHO they are.  
But we have to mention also that they have accomplices, the ones that are executing their plan: banksters, WHO, high level governments (including chinese and russian), UN, NATO, few high level people in big corporations (and in special the big pharma), actors and media. All these accomplices, we already know that they were convinced, blackmailed, brainwashed and so on to participate into this evil plan.  

2. **Why: to convert the population into a mass modern slavery, that will obey and produce for them**  
For decades now, we were bombarded with bullshit slogans like ""we are too many on this planet, we have to act now"". That was the plan and we already know how they push it. To sustain THEIR lives and power, they do not need 8 billion people/sheeple/slaves, they just need few millions, obedient and totally controlled. And slowly many of these could be replaced with robots, AI, automation.  

3. **How: reducing the population to a number that can be more easily controlled**  
For many hundred of years they tried in many ways: wars, diseases, experiments, chemtrails, weather control, birth control, now spreading false viruses and conducting worldwide hoax induced by FEAR. They still have many ""weapons"" to release... they can't kill over night 8 billion people. **We are too many, still**.  
Here I will extend a bit, just to see that this part is IN EXECUTION NOW.  

- Factcheck: for decades they were creating regional wars and instability in many places around the globe, sometimes for no logical reason. This was creating massive migrant exodus and bring fear, instability, diseases, crimes etc.  
- Factcheck: for decades they were creating various weapons for mass destruction, in labs and then release them: viruses, diseases, infections, HARP, chemtrails, 5G.  
- Factcheck: right now they released the ultimate weapon and plan - COVID-1984 and reduce the population at 50%  
1. There is something that is not proved 100% that seems to act as an infection (but not really is) that seems to be activated in 5G proximity  
2. It is clear now that this ""infection"" is not a virus, it is presented like that to put people in FEAR mode. But now we have probes that could be easily detected as an exosome that we all have regularly in our bodies. it is clear now that these exosome combined with fear and other illnesses can create a chain reaction and people die.  
**Yes, there is no hoax, people die in hospitals, but that doesn't mean they are dying BECAUSE of COVID-1984. There is no proof for that.** In fact this is their plan, to kill as much as they can. They started with the most vulnerable: old, sick, weak.  
3. Now come the 2nd wave of deaths: those that are not old, sick, weak. **Those that will be infected in the ""TESTING"" PROCESS**. Yes you hear it here: the testing process will be actually the grand operation to literally infect people with a deadly pathogen. Medical staff doesn't know anything about this, they are innocents and they will die many also.  
They are preparing now, large places with medical tents, where people will be forced to be ""tested"" for the so called COVID-1984, **but in fact those tests contain the deadly pathogen**. With the inserting the deadly pathogen, you will be declared ""INFECTED"" and isolated in special facilities (already in place, that's why there are empty now). Once you are isolated, in few days you will get the symptoms and you will be put in hospital bed for ICU, but the medical staff will not be informed how to treat it, they will have false information and people will die anyway. Medics now start to see things that doesn't make sense and those who dare to say something will be ELIMINATED.  
**YES PEOPLE WILL DIE WITH MILLIONS** But wearing a mask or isolate in house, will NOT protect you in any case. **THIS IS THE FUCKING LIE, TO KEEP YOU CONTROLLED AND QUIET, until their plan can't be reversed**  
4. 5G installations are going fast now, but remember: are NOT activated on full power until are everywhere. Will fool people that start now to protest against, they will release a non-lethal frequency to ""prove"" you that is OK. Later will beam the hell us and people will fall like flies.  
5. Those selected NOT to be infected or get immune, will be anyway forced vaccinated with ID2020.org and later totally controlled with 5G. Those will be the modern slaves that will continue to serve the masters.  

4. **When: NOW, it's happening right now, under your eyes. There's no more time to investigate and do nothing.**  
Is time to wake as many we can. We are still much more then them. We are still billions, they are just few.  
First we need to get the medics, from the 1st line to speak, freely, openly, with big balls. Yes it is a huge risk for them, but there's no other option anyway, they will die soon too.  
We need more specialist to speak (we already have more than 20 yelling as much as they can on social media). But we need more, the medics in hospitals, don't be afraid, come up and say what you have to say, don't fall into their trap. We know that many are there in fear and do not dare to speak. We will support you in every possible way.  
  
The question is: **YOU WANT TO DIE AS A SLAVE SHEEPLE OR AS A FREE MAN?**  

We need to wake up police and army, as many is possible. They are few, those who will still remain with NWO plan, will be less, we are still many,. What they are going to do? To arrest us all? Where to put billions of people in jail? To kill us? We will die anyway soon, so we have NOTHING to lose. We are NOT afraid of any ""infection"", we already know that the infection is WHEN they put something into your body, not from the air/touch. Maybe later they will come with a airborn pathogen, as an ultimate chance for them, but in this moment there's NO risk.  

We need to organize and get out, massive protests and force governments to be responsible and pay for all the damage. We can reverse this into OUR TIME, OUR PLAN towards FREEDOM. **ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.**

No matter whether you believe the official story on 9/11, or that it was an ""inside job"" here are some things that are undeniably true. In its aftermath, as the public was in a state of distress, the U.S. government took upon massive, harmful programs that otherwise never would have been accepted by the public. These include **The Patriot Act** and the **$7 trillion wars in Iraq and Afghanistan** (and we're still in Afghanistan).

Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, as the world is in a state of distress, whether you think it is a natural disease or a bio-weapon, world governments are taking action, which, under normal conditions would never be acceptable. These include **full lock-downs** which may last for months, **full-on travel bans**, and **universal basic income**. Now, some of these measures, I believe, are going to be permanent in less severe forms than they are now. Take the travel bans. I don't believe air travel will ever be like what it was before COVID-19.

Just like after 9/11 in America, there are going to be extra requirements put in place. I fully expect countries around the world to require foreign travelers to either **get tested for COVID-19** or **prove that they've been vaccinated** against it before being issued a visa or allowed entrance.

Just like after 9/11 in America, there are going to be new surveillance systems put in place. Governments around the world are going to follow China's lead, and we're going to see systems put in place to **geographically trace** those who've been infected through their phones and the disease will be mapped in that way permanently. We're going to see **drones** that sense people's temperatures in the street. We are going to see COVID-19 vaccinations show up on people's **credit scores or background checks**. For this pandemic and the next.

And we're going to see something new: **Universal Basic Income**. The service industry has been destroyed overnight, and it's not coming back soon. The same applied to the events industry, which includes music concerts, sporting events, markets, retailers, shopping malls, and so on. Millions upon millions have been put out of work and will continue to be unemployed and underemployed. Some form of UBI will be implemented on a more **permanent  basis** all around the world. I believe that the purpose of this is to further destroy the more natural, community based small-business and independent economy. People will have just enough money to get food and a cell phone and streaming services, and simultaneously be demotivated to start their own independent endeavors. Those mega-companies like Amazon and other tech firms and delivery services, which have already decimated communities all over America, are only going to grow stronger.

Those are just some of the things that have occurred to me off the top of my head, I'm sure there are many more different and terrifying things to come. There are some dark days ahead, but we must remain vigilant and pay attention to every single way the TPTB are and will continue to take advantage of this situation in an authoritarian and elitist fashion.

EDIT: on the 5G issue, I don’t think it’s causing the coronavirus. The real reason we’re seeing the rollout of 5G infrastructure alongside the pandemic is because the surveillance systems that are being developed in response to COVID-19 are going to leverage its capabilities.",conspiracy,5G

Apparently the news that Switzerland was banning 5G was misleading, rather they stopped building more towers but planned to use the existing towers for the 5G launch last week.

This means that most of Switzerland's cities have a 'thinned out' coverage and yet citizens are already reporting-

*""As soon as the antennas were installed, several residents and entire families in the heart of Geneva reported similar unusual symptoms of loud ringing in the ear, intense headaches, unbearable earaches, insomnia, chest pain, fatigue and not feeling well in the house.""*

A quote from a Geneva resident - *""The day after the 5G antennas in Geneva started working, I had headaches  on my left side, severe chest pain in my heart and very loud and acute  whistling in my ears. All this was totally new to me, I’ve never  experienced these pains before.""*

Conspiracy theory's aside, there's hundreds if not thousands of reputable people in medicine, science, engineering, technology and military all singing the same tune, 5G is dangerous to human health, and should be banned or at least tested properly.

Here are some noteworthy passages from a recent admin announcement, which is directed at moderators side-wide:

>The situation on the ground is constantly changing and so we are trying to strike a balance of acting quickly on claims that might cause or encourage violence or physical harm (such as advice to drink bleach, or calls to vandalize phone towers), while ensuring that you, as mods, have the necessary resources and support you need to set appropriate standards for your individual communities.

>We know you already have your hands full, so please know that you are not on the hook to be able to verify every piece of COVID-19 information that passes through your subreddit.

>We will work closely with moderators if we see misinformation regularly cropping up in their subreddits. Unless the subreddit is dedicated to misinformation, our goal is always to start with education and cooperation and only escalate to quarantine or ban if necessary.

>In the coming weeks, we’ll be adding misinformation as a proper option in the reporting flow for all users.

When pressed for clarification about whether this referred to COVID-19 misinformation specifically, this was the reply:

>This applies to all types of misinformation. Our post today is not about changing any policies - we’re addressing Covid specifically because we know it is affecting all of your communities right now. We wanted to reiterate what we’re doing our end as well as give you as moderators and users a way to report what you’re seeing so we can investigate.

So, how might this affect /r/conspiracy? 

It shouldn't, as long as we continue doing exactly what what we've been doing. Keep reporting *all* calls to violence, and this *absolutely* includes any semblance of encouragement for the destruction of property (ie 5G equipment).

Fortunately, we have a passionate and robust user base, and a dedicated mod team, and we are proud to boast [limited admin involvement](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/transparencyreports) over recent months. 

Indeed, despite the routine attempts to paint this community in a poor light, largely due to [the semantic manipulation of the word ""conspiracy"" itself](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fpycie/why_is_rconspiracy_still_around_the_answer_may/), this forum is still, unequivocally, **""dedicated to free thinking and for discussing issues which have captured your imagination.""**

As stated by a member of the mod team:

 >On /r/conspiracy, we have always held the position that we, as mods, make NO PRETENSE of being the arbiters of what is or is not ""truth"", and doing so would contradict the very foundations on which this sub was built, and what makes it a truly unique forum on Reddit.""

That being said, we recognize that the Reddit admins are free to decide what content to restrict on their website, and this includes material they deem to be ""misinformation.""

To reiterate: Even with these new guidelines, there's no reason admin intervention on /r/conspiracy can't be kept to a bare minimum. 

In addition, there's no reason why this should affect our ability to entertain all manners of ""high octane"" speculation (the raison d'etre of this sub!), as healthy hypothesizing is a far cry from the actual spreading of misinformation, unwittingly or not.

As long as we keep reporting and removing content with harmful intent or repercussions, /r/conspiracy should remain in compliance under these new guidelines.

In situations such as these, it is always a wise idea to see as to what such persons are DOING as opposed to what they are SAYING. I repeat, **DOING > SAYING**. And when you do that, it gets **real obvious real quick** as to the **TRUE agendas** of these kinds and varieties of people.  

Here's what Elon Musk is **DOING:**  

He is making **NeuraLink** a thing.  

He is literally **LAUNCHING A SHITLOAD OF 5G SATELLITES** into our skies as we speak.  

*(This is very important)* He hasn't uttered a SINGLE WORD against vaccinations or Mr. Gates till date.  

Dude is a part of the Billionaire elite, has a past that is notorious for extremely shady treatment of his own employees and even has pics with Ghislaine Maxwell (don't tell me that he as an elite had no idea as to *who* he was posing with here).  

He has been into digging TUNNELS under the USA. I don't need to tell anyone (on **r/conspiracy** of all places) as to *what exactly* happens in underground tunnels - despite the many ""support-worthy"" reasons being given for the same by this particular individual.  

Elon Musk seems to have a thing for making fear-based doomsday predictions. I mean, I'm sure most of you on here have seen his Joe Rogan interview. **How many spiritually evolved individuals of THE LIGHT have you seen spreading mass fear this way?** (In fact, WHO within our world has been known to use fear, anger, hatred and other such negative thoughts/intentions/energies to their advantage here?)

But then, you will say, what about all of the good things? All of the electric cars, solar roof tiles and the whole Mars colonization thing? What about him ""hinting things"" by asking as to who owns the entire media?  

It's an easy explanation. The powers-that-were have a time-tested control and manipulation formula. Mix a little bit of truth in between a little bit of lies. Again: **Mix a little bit of truth in between a little bit of lies.** That way, you are always able to maintain plausible deniability. That way, when someone asks you as to ""why did you never speak about the elite?"" -- you can point to a [**""cryptic"" tweet such as this one**](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1000560049389907969) (useful in appeasing US conservatives). That way, when someone asks you ""why didn't you do something about global warming?"" -- you can point out your solar roof tiles and electric cars and how you are taking on the Saudi Oil Establishment all alone (this appeases the US liberals). By the way, the oil lobby, pharma lobby, or any other lobby wouldn't let you LIVE TOO LONG if you weren't on their side in some way. Or at the very best, you would be harassed like anything [**like they did to this guy**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/maeve-kennedy-granddaughter-missing.html).  

**So when you are NOT getting harassed, STILL LIVING, drilling fucking tunnels under the USA with whatever excuses you are making for that, NOT saying A SINGLE WORD against Bill Gates or Vaccinations, and finally, making Neura-Fucking-Link and other AI tools of all things, you have NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF GOOD left within you.** Because our man here likes to ride two boats at once and appease both aspects of the equation (as it works within the US i.e. ""the left"" and ""the right"") at the same time. But such tricks aren't going to work any longer, for the *Great Awakening* is here indeed.  

**You want the LEGIT TRUTH SPEAKERS?** Look at all of the people who are getting **shunned** by one and all. The people who are putting their **VERY LIVES on the line** as their **loved ones are getting slaughtered** by the elite. The people who aren't giving ""cryptic hints"" and fucking ""smoke signals"" (it is no *coincidence here* that the elites are famous for conjuring illusions using ""smoke and mirrors""), but are instead, **TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AS IT IS** ***DESPITE ALL COSTS.***  

**THOSE are the people that you need to be supporting.** ***Truly BRAVE*** **individuals such as** [**Robert. F. Kennedy Junior**](https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr). Not this two-faced Musk scum.  

End of post.  

**EDIT:** For all of those who asked. **How exactly does Musk's agenda even work here?** Here's the full story.  

Basically, the deep state elite / cabal / Illuminati (whatever you wanna call em) wanted to off of most of humanity here through this virus -- which is why you see that kind of a plotline as the story to *nearly all Sci-Fi content* that you currently consume be it shows, movies, comics, or *what-have-you.* Yeah, predictive programming and all of that sorta stuff. So, getting to the point, [**the gang wanted to kill off the maximum global population**](https://www.westernjournal.com/report-obama-admin-funded-chinas-coronavirus-research-gave-millions-taxpayer-money-wuhan-lab/) using this virus, crash the economy, and then create a New World Order of enslaved masses using *vaccine-delivered-microchips* -- in order that they may be able to *then* continue ruling this vast slave-planet joyfully and freely. They wanted to have everyone wear **masks,** symbolic of the **""we'll do whatever the fuck we want right in front of you and you'll all keep your mouths fucking shut out of FEAR""**. Much like what you see in bondage-porn. Control. Dominance. Power-over-others. Which is one victory that they did get, mind you. But then, the *plot went sideways.*  

You see, these elites are not the *only intelligent entities* upon our world (or beyond it). Neither are they as powerful as they think themselves to be. So, suffice it to say that they all got a little, errrrr....*outsmarted* here.  

Their plan to open a negative energy vortex/timeline using the CERN Hadron Collider and to grant [**dark beings access**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/701484/Satanic-human-sacrifice-video-CERN) into our dimension was derailed by [**gas leaks**](https://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn16254-damage-that-derailed-higgs-hunt/), [**bird droppings**](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/06/cern-big-bang-goes-phut), and [**actual fucking weasels**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36173247) showing up to ruin the party. But our dark friends refused to learn their lesson.  

So instead of ""Pandemic 1"" killing off most of the human populace and getting the rest to obediently stand in line (in order to get chipped right back to slavery) [**other un-wanted things ensued**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/frd0qo/global_pandemic_or_global_gift/). Furthermore, as the [**masses started awakening**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fzpxdm/99_of_comments_on_bill_gatess_social_media_say/) and plenty of their lot started getting arrested, put in home-quarantine or ""getting the virus"" (code for [**getting killed**](https://www.eonline.com/news/1135492/spanish-princess-becomes-the-first-royal-to-die-of-coronavirus-complications) OR [**being quarantined for mass-trials later**](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/coronavirus-widespread-among-saudi-royal-family-report/ar-BB12nyMj) ) their plans just started going [**south**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/royals/king-felipe-of-spain-s-relative-86-becomes-first-royal-to-die-from-coronavirus/ar-BB11Q7uO) after [**south**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/covid-19-prince-charles-tests-positive-remains-in-self-isolation-in-scotland/articleshow/74810710.cms) after [**south**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8200269/Coronavirus-spreads-party-Venezuelan-elite.html), day after day after day.  

You see, it just so happens that this virus that they so carefully made to destroy humanity, happens to be super-lethal for Adrenochrome users. So all of those pre-created vaccines that so many of them took so happily before this epidemic got its ""worldwide release"" may not, well, *work* as nicely as they'd all hoped. Expect many, many more names of elites dying (due to Covid-19) to be hitting the news as we go along here. And before you even ask folks, YES, they [**ALL KNEW**](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/03/296939/insider-trading-us-senators-sold-stocks-before-covid-19-crash/) WHAT WAS COMING [**SINCE LONG, LONG, BACK**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fyy370/2013_rapper_predicts_2020_combined_with/fn2ju84/).   

Finally, the main question: **WHY EXACTLY is Elon Musk** ***doing*** **all of this?** Good question. You see, a few days back, [**these interesting videos**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9kzks/id_watch_these_coronavirus_protests_for_hours/) topped the [**very front page of Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g9fxxg/usa/) with *all of the medals in the world* -- BOTH (front page + medal getting) being super sureshot signs here that all of the mainstream media **REALLY WANTED YOU TO SEE** *all of that stuff.* And oh by the way, both Elon Musk and Reddit posted this stuff out on the exact same day, because [**the NARRATIVE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4sisf/just_in_case_you_still_havent_figured_it_out/) must [**ALWAYS be consistent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4ts3q/using_propaganda_to_shape_public_perceptions_of) ***no-matter-what.*** And obviously, most right-wingers wouldn't question how the entire video seems staged (just check out the presentation, background music used), right down to this [**super-pathetic actor dude**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g7fwve/can_you_cough_in_my_face/) and his *fake-as-fuck-talk* in which he lists out **every single ""tinfoil-hatter-conspiracy-nutjob-trope-there-is""** right down to the last fucking T? With *Flat-Earth* and all of that shit included? Yes folks. Many or all of those folks that you saw in those videos were actors infiltrating the protests.  

But why even **do** all of this? *What exactly* does one stand to gain from all of this counter-lockdown protesting? It's easy. You see, by NOW painting the lockdown as a ""left-wing conspiracy"" (because their mass murder plans failed and THEY started getting arrested instead (whereas the normal people simply remained SAFE inside their own homes), they realised that they were losing and LOSING HARD. So what is the last fucking option that they all had *left* here? That's right. *Much like a cornered animal BITES and SCRATCHES and SWINGS madly at ALL THAT IT SEES,* so too did **they all decide** that now is the time to get everyone *pouring out of their homes* so that *everyone that they have ever ruled over* **""go down with them""**. And by giving this a polarized and divisive ""Right v/s Left"" narrative here (and using Elon's previously built appeal towards the right-wing folks to their own benefit), they thought that NOW was the time indeed to *kill one and all.* Basically, the ""if we're going down then we are going down *with you""* approach. So by getting you all out NOW, it is super-easy to [**co-ordinate some crazy ass mass shootings**](https://qanon.pub/data/media/8ab5a5a0c1b486bb298c3011a9d88c52b511755f5e30a0d9dbc3ecb3e159aa25.png) like they've always done before.  

Also notable here is the fact that the elites are **REQUIRED BY DIVINE LAW** to **always state** their **true** intentions in some way, shape, or form here in front of the masses. Which is why you see them doing all of that predictive programming and [**hand-signs**](https://i.redd.it/q6n3qv8e8ns41.png) and all of that shit [**all over the internet**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/5e/e1/ba5ee165345bdcf7149f9c2d90a5d549.jpg) for [**all to see**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a1/29/11a12931d039c27f965fde5b4b013051.png). Which is why you will now be able to see our dear friend Elon Musk sporting a display picture that says [**Deus Ex Machina**](https://i.imgur.com/SXCiC1q.png). For the uninitiated, that means, and I quote [**the Oxford Dictionary here**](https://i.imgur.com/itWfnja.png) as saying  

> ""An **unexpected power or event** saving a **seemingly hopeless situation,** especially as a **contrived plot device** in a **play** or novel""  

Also, ""Necromancer"" above (captioned below the display picture) stands for, and I [**once again quote the Oxford Dictionary on this**](https://i.imgur.com/oYCgFXD.png),  

> ""A person who practices necromancy; a wizard or magician"" and ""magic involving communication with the dead"". Interestingly enough, it also names a certain [**Dr. Faustus**](https://i.imgur.com/oYCgFXD.png) as a *""16th century necromancer.""* Hmm. **Dr Faustus.** Where exactly have I heard *that name* before? Man, I sure as hell just can't seem to be able to [***place it*** **anywhere**](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11507231/dr-fauci-7-4-million-funding-wuhan-lab-blamed-covid-19-conspiracy/).  

Alas. *This part of the plan* isn't going to work as smoothly as they'd hoped either. Because the people are now all awakening. And because, *it is now time* for this entire Great Awakening ride to get just a little *wilder.* Thank you for reading.  

**EDIT 2:** On *tremendously* popular demand, I've made the above edit as a [**separate post of its own here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gb3gob/the_complete_untold_coronavirus_lockdown_story/) for all of you to easily be able to link to your friends, relatives, acquaintances, social media followers and such here.

131,Theres alot of strange stuff going on in my town...,147.0,cyzya7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cyzya7/theres_alot_of_strange_stuff_going_on_in_my_town/,98.0,1567484384.0,"Over the past 5 months I have witnessed occasional police activity in my neighborhood. By occasionally I mean, weekend long operations 1-2 times a month. I'm talking car chases, marked and unmarked police at high speeds through stop signs, hearing altercations throughout the town, and even raids with state police mid-day. This is all clear and obvious some of which recorded.
The associated activity I have witnessed includes countless drones recorded in the night sky, street lights and electricity malfunctions, my personal electronic and work devices misbehaving only at home, slowed internet and disrupted cell conections. Followed by high amounts of vehicle traffic around the neighborhood, which prove to be the same vehicles again and again. 
My dog and many others that I can hear  are alert of of this activity before it occurs, as I believe there are also frequencies associated which I can even pick up on at times. All animals, including crickets, cicadas, and birds becomes highly irritated during these times of the activity. 
I have also witnessed and recorded and unexplainable sound coming from seeming the no where, likened to a small jet engine, that moves slowly across the sky. I have found similar recordings on YouTube. This is all queued by a horn or firework, and surveillance picks up prior. Vehicles begin to utilize ally ways normally not used. They ignore traffic laws and even block off sections of the street. 

This was recently capped off by event occurring right in front of my home that has left me perplexed. A vehicle parked illegally inside a crosswalk and intersection, shown its headlight through my front blinds for nearly 15 mins. During which fireworks went off at a house on my block, where many alterations have taken place. The vehicle began to roll forward as I was watching it through my front door, coming close to a parked car in front of it. I decided to approach the vehicle and see if the driver was impaired. 
The window was already down when I approached and asked the only driver what's was going on. He replied ""Police.""; confused I said okay and continued asking what was happening. Doing so he pulled a gun and pointed in the direction of my house and I rebutted back, stepping away. I saw him drive off as another passenger entered, and I ran in to call 911. Almost immediately, all traffic picked up and headed to the main roads as if these associated vehicles were spooked; including drones in the sky.

What has ensued since that call is complete diversion from the police. Including unwillingness to pursue the suspect and key details of the event. They even attempted to itemidate me as the suspect on site. It's been over a week and they have not returned any of my calls. This event would have been the second time 911 was contacted on suspicious behavior around me house, both not pursued. I've talked to community relations which surprisingly sounded concerned of my now 5 months history of events, but has since declined returning my calls.

There are endless unexplainable things that occur with this activity, which I have slowly been piecing together. The activity continued this weekend even through my typing this currently. In all honesty I believe what they are doing is harmful, similar to 5G. Not to mention the laws that may be broken here. It is a great disturbance that I have come to no means of resolution. 

I'm considering fully documenting the events and publishing stories, including locally, to make the citizens aware. Its what I've proposed to the police at the least, but they are reluctant to even engage at this point. I have on last pending email before I blow this open. 

Has anyone else experienced similar? I could go into the really nutty shit but I'll save that for the follow ups with proof. 

The bottomline is I believe there is wide scale police operations occurring in my town. This would be highly illegal in the circumstances I have witnessed and been trained in. To note, I have nothing to hide or be concerned about from this activity.

(Long post)",144.0,7rs5px,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7rs5px/while_everyone_is_being_distracted_with_vegas_and/,129.0,1516473475.0,"I know this post is long, but this matters and it matters now. 
This post is written regarding the 5G Smart Grid/Internet of things that's being rolled out by every government (and tech giants like Google/Facebook) around the world; even those who seem to be in conflict with each other.

ATT is rolling out 5G VR-WIFI this year. Understand that all previous cellular services were labeled according to their Radio Frequency location on the Radio Spectrum. I.E. 3G = 3GHZ and 4G = 4GHz. This was done deliberately for the purpose of concealing the fact that 5G = 24GHz - 90GHz. That is the millimeter wave (based on length of waves) section of the spectrum. It is classified as Extremely High Frequency Ionizing Radiation. 

The compact nature of millimeter waves results in heavy interference from just about everything. This limits the distance a signal can travel as well as being line of sight only. Water molecules in the air for example cause heavy loss in signal strength. The only way to compensate for these issues and still deliver the band width promised with the Internet Of Things, is to have 5G WIFI routers on every telephone pole in the country, in every room of every public building in the country, boosted by every CFL bulb(on the box) and smart meter. Even satellites for those in the sticks. If you are saying to yourself 
>""Wait a minute, I'm 70% water!"" 

then you are asking yourself exactly the right question. 

The next question is how the hell do we stop something the white hats don't think is a problem and are even pushing for. Trump believes in geoengineering and he just put out a statement in December declaring all sorts of things you can only do with 5G to be a national priority. Q nor Trump have in any way mentioned these dangers. I say now, the whole Q phenomenon and its results are just another distraction, like they have done so many times before, this time, so they can pull off the most lethal thing ever done to this planet. 

Every living thing is harmed by Ionizing Radiation. As the densely packed waves bounce off cells in your body they cause minor damage, as your body repairs this damage, occasionally the process results in cancer.

It breaks strands of DNA. We are exposed every day to harmful radiation from both natural and man made sources. Unless you live under a cell tower or high power lines, that radiation amounts to a misting in most cases, in order for 5G to work, it will be akin to jumping in the ocean. The reason they put lead a vest on when you get an X-ray is EXACTLY the reason they refused to do any safety testing on 5G


 They didn't need to, they know 24GHz - 90GHz will kill you, especially at the levels of signal saturation required to reach everywhere. Milliwatts per square meter is how they measure Electromagnetic Frequency Exposure and 2.5 is the highest amount reported to be safe as of 2013. 

The amount measured when laying a meter on a new ATT residential 5G router was 1800+. Now make that commercial and Imagine the overlap and omni directional bombardment of walking through a mall, school, city street and your 1000+ living room doesn't seem so bad anymore. This is microwave radiation, they took the device that cooks your food out of the microwave, modified it for data and plan on placing them everywhere. 

This is the technology they use at airports that can see through your clothes. They can literally boil the water in your skin. I can only imagine the things they could do to your brain, but it might explain why, for as long as i can remember, there have been zombie movies. 


The signal that comes from the transmitters has the ability to send out multiple, seperate, pinpoint focused beams that automatiaclly track every wifi receiving device that comes into its signal range. The military has been using millimeter wave technology for at least fourty years. They just need you, me and everyone else to look the other way while they deploy it. 


If we wait until the Internet of things is online it will be too late. Q's pyramid was setup up to fall exactly how its falling. Trumps faction was given the goods on the old guard in order to get them out of the way. Then use the repercussions to set up everyone to accept the new 5G internet of things. The level of evil/corruption in the old guard was necessary and it served at least three purposes.

1. Fear and control over the elites for as long at they were needed. 

2. Easy disposal of the elites and there structure of control once they had served their purpose. 

3. Getting the public to react so emotionally/viscerally to the child sacrificing stuff.

Combined with the monetary chaos the market manipulation will cause, as well as all the drug/weapon/trafficing garbage, that they will embrace the incorruptible, block-chain secured, D-wave driven, Palantir/IOT fed AI overlord as new supreme being/god/ruler. Crypto-currency builds the block chain, the block chain is the neural network of the global Artificial General Intelligence. AGI is the one they make all the scary movies about. The crypto currency is also the best trap imaginable for getting people to buy in to the system. I.E. You have 2 million in crypto that can only be accessed as a member of our system. That's the reason for the war on cash, once currency exist only in the system, you have no choice but to join the system or attempt to exist completely and utterly outside of it which will be made illegal shortly after the system comes online. 



Regardless of method, they will find a way to get enough people accept the system that those who don't, won't be missed. None of us have ever heard the names of those who give the elites their orders. The elites live in total fear of these beings as their families have made bargains with them for millennia and they understand the true nature of what I call the Hidden Hand. They have been called many things by many people for as long as there is recorded history.  Fallen angels if you are Christian or Luciferian. Satan presented himself as a serpent that could talk and walk upright in the Garden of Eden and reptilian is still one of the most enduring theories.


Every ancient culture we have records from show some sort of God/s that interacted with them. Once the population of the planet reached a point that they could no longer control it with direct, individual based fear, a new method of domination became necessary.

At this point they decided to rewrite all of human history as the first step in separating humanity from the God/Creator/Source/Light whatever you choose to call it. If you do not believe in creation/reincarnation, then I point you to DNA.  It is incomprehensibly more powerful, both as a computer and as a storage device then anything we have imagined at this point in our evolution. Evolution is the natural process of creation adapting to its environment in order to thrive, exactly the way the DNA was designed to do. Every human emotion can be traced back to just two base emotions, Love and fear. Love is from ""God"" (you) and it is the meaning of life. 


Your purpose, as the highest intellect on this planet, a human being with unlimited potential and the ability to do help or harm, is to show Love to every other living thing in existence. The molecular structure of water is affected by words written on pieces of paper and taped to the outside of the bottle. Beautiful snowflake like structures for kind words, amorphous cancer looking structures for mean words. Words, thoughts and emotions have the power to affect the physical world and again, we are 70% water. The Hidden Hand exist and operate in direct opposition to, and resentment of, ""God"". It doesn't matter in the slightest if you believe in God or Lucifer...

...THEY DO! They always have and they act upon that belief. Fear, suffering and despair is their desire for the creation they despise. They have turned our existence into a farm for that fear. Differences between humans, both real and imagined is their seed. How is it that countries that sanction, sabotage, spy on and go to war with each other, have no problems what so ever sharing any and all info about things like CERN and all agree that geoengineering our atmosphere is the only way to go? The differences created by them shape our emotions and beliefs so powerfully that it is accepted in every country with a military, for the young people to go kill or be killed based solely on the discretion of the government.

How many wars do we now know were started with a false flag or under false pretenses?
The final act in the play is to turn the Earth into an artificial existence that nothing can survive unless it has been modified from its original form in order to do so. Everything with DNA in it is going to be bombarded in the microwave hell they are creating. The final nail in man kinds coffin and the only way to survive the system is going to be through genetic modification/trans-humanism. Once we ""jack in"" to the system, the system will control our memories, emotions and thoughts and we will no longer have any memory of what life was like before the system. 

Pretty much every president has been used as a wedge to drive apart the American people. And the last one that didn't ended up with a bullet through the head. The last two presidents have been atomic wedgies in that regard. If you don't have things that have made you question Trumps motives, you are not paying attention. Environment, geoengineering, oil, fracking, Goldman Sachs, Zionist, selling weapons. And please don't wait any longer for someone with big words like Trump to show up... Seriously, his motivations, the end of corruption, saving the children, all these bad guys being taken down, all of it is meaningless if the 5G/VR-WIFI/IOT is allowed to come online. Please look around, the whole planet is sprinting toward the system and its completely separate from everything Q related.﻿


If there's anyone who managed to have an attention span longer than that of a goldfish, it's time to realize YOU are the solution. The solution lies within yourself and it's not going to come by voting for the next puppet in 2 years. Educate yourself on the 5G Smart Grid that's being rolled out. Do whatever you can and want to spread the information. Even copying this post and spreading it around will help.

Digitaltrends.com says that ""The spectrum [of 5g] also contains light, gamma rays, x-rays, microwaves, and much more.""

They are going to be putting these things up at every street corner basically, due to their short range.

So my immediate concern is with physical health, this seems exceptionally dangerous. I mean, our consciousness is [vibration](https://i.imgur.com/P6f0TSl.jpg), our cells vibrate, and they are going to be bombarded with serious, intense waves. How can they maintain their integrity against this onslaught? Sickness of the mind and body is sure to follow. 

And deeper in the rabbit hole is the possibility of weaponizing 5g to be used against us.

Such as shutting down a major protest.

Or maybe they magnify waves that stimulate anger and fear centers, causing riots, chaos and violence.

We have to say no to 5g

I know one anti-5g activist and she has had major success on a local level organizing and petitioning the city council to block any initiatives bringing 5g to their town.

It can be done.

Love vibes, 
Timothy

Edit: y'all need to read or watch the Greenbaum Speech and see the extent that the shadow government has perfected mind control through vibrational manipulation.

 But before you begin, I challenge you to google this number for me, and tell me what it means for main stream media:

US6506148 B2

Now, that I have your attention... read this:

▪️ The entire world is in lockdown.
 Let that sink in..
 (If it hasn’t already)

▪️5G was being rolled out world wide before the lock down and briefly during the lock down (What stopped them?).
 Remember when they told us not to sit too close to the TV or stand in front of microwaves? Multiply that...
 (Research health effects of 5G)

▪️Prince Harry and Megan leave the royal family.
 (Why would they do that now?)

▪️Prince  Andrew is a known pedophile, extremely close to Jeffrey Epstein(who is  convicted pedophile & human/sex/slave trafficker)and visited Epstein  Island multiple times.

▪️Research Epstein Island and the fight log of visitors to the island.
 (if you have a strong stomach)

▪️Reasearch Pizzagate(Clinton/Podesta emails) and fbi documents that reveal pedophiles “secret code language and symbolism”
 (if you can handle it)

▪️Wiki  leaks exposed Hillary Clinton for being a child sex trafficker (along  with Obama, Podesta and many other people in power) and she conveniently  deletes around 340,000 emails, destroys a laptop and mobile phone she  used while in office... and gets away with it??

▪️Research  the Weiner Laptop. This evidence is what had hardened NYC investigators  vomiting and in tears. Truly horrifying acts against children but by  who? Research... I’m not doing this for you. I already know.

▪️Trump  is elected & he stays elected. Impeachment failed. (Jerome Corsi,  delivered a pretty profound message about Trump/Obama, that comes to  mind as I mention this, look it up.)

▪️Harvey  Weinstein, Hollywood’s biggest germ, was finally arrested for sex  crimes and all of a sudden he gets the “virus”? (huge pedo)

▪️Prince  Charles & now also the Queen conveniently have the “virus”, yet the  queen fled the palace to self isolate weeks ago...?

▪️Adrenochrome (children’s blood infused with adrenaline) is FDA approved, complete with patent information, google it.

▪️Epstein[did not]kill him self, in prison.

▪️Isaac  Kappy [did not] hang himself from that bridge. Convenient how both  Kappy and Epstein, were cooperating with the police and giving some  really BIG names of those who participated in pedophilia and human  trafficking, among other sick crimes against humanity, just “suicided”.
 Right? Riiiiight.

▪️Bill  Gates is pushing to mandate vaccines[ingredients] and global  depopulation(too many humans suffocate the earth). How convenient that  Gates owns 15% of the WHO (World Health Organization). Yes, the WHO is a  business, go figure. Which is also owned by George Soros and the  Rockerfellers. Don’t know them? Do your research. Also, research Agenda  21.

▪️Bill Gates speaks about a pandemic on TedTalk[2015]and state we would not be ready for it, when it happens.

▪️Obama predicts a pandemic[2014] and speaks about it happening within next 5 years. Coincidence? I think not.

▪️Google images for the new 2020 quarter. How about that design?

▪️Luciferian  entertainers like Madonna and Lady CaCa are attempting to guide their  followers to blindly support Gates and his agenda for mandated COVID19  vaccines. Lady GaGa’s new album art looks like something from the human  harvesting scene in the movie, the Matrix(very disturbing). Her album is  also named “Chromatica” and once you learn what adrenochrome is, you  won’t read that the same. Maybe listen to Madonna’s song “Illuminati”  and learn why Madam X wears a patch over her left eye. (This information  alone should make your stomach churn). Coincidence? Not a chance.

▪️ Marina Abramovic is a 73yr old (remember her age when you see her  current photos)very dark, very morbid artist who stepped up as the new  face of Microsoft, only to be removed 3 days after the commercial aired.  Due to the massive amounts of negative feedback on the commercial for  her “altered reality” goggles, she was forced to step down and the video  was deleted. The masses are waking up and the collective seen her for  monster she truly is, and publicity rejected her. (See how powerful  UNITY is? We the people did that!) Abramovic’s dark art is an attempt to  normalize her Luciferian ritualistic human sacrifices, blood lust,  cannibalism and pedophilia.
 (Google “Spirit Cooking” and some images  of her “art” but be warned, some is quite disturbing and  children/babies/blood/bones are involved)

▪️Google is currently uncensored and you can access this information. (Why now?)

▪️A batch of tainted Adrenochrome was made in Wuhan... coincidence?
 (Connecting the dots yet?)

▪️US has deployed 30,000 troops to Europe. “for training”. Without masks or any hand sanitizer. Interesting...

▪️600  Mexican drug cartels have recently been arrested, one of the biggest  busts in history by the U.S... why didn’t we hear about that? If you  still don’t understand, you didn’t google (US6506148 B2) my 1st  challenge at the top of this post.

▪️Trump  speaks about the war on the “unseen enemy” often during his daily  briefings. A few statements have stuck with me. Trump states that he’s  never seen anything like “this”, that the closest comparison would be in  1917(WWI). Trump said that thousands of soldiers are being distributed  throughout the states to help with “spill over in the streets” while  fighting this unseen enemy and he has said that there will be lots of  deaths but there would be many more if we didn’t act immediately. Trump  is very careful with his words and will lead you to question whether or  not he’s actually even talking about the virus.

▪️ The increase in “earthquakes” throughout the country is pretty  alarming... Research the difference between underground bombs versus a  naturally occurring earthquake and you realize that the majority are not  earthquakes.

▪️ 298 Saudi’s royals, billionaires, lawyers and judges were recently arrested for crimes and corruption.

▪️2  Chinese nationals and 1 Harvard professor(Dr Lieber is the chair of the  chemistry department at Harvard who specializes in nanotechnology)were  prosecuted for economic espionage a few weeks ago, (they were all on  China’s payroll) which is all extremely relevant to Wuhan, the “escape”  of Covid-19 from a lab in Wuhan. Research this.

▪️People’s Liberation Army, who are they?

▪️Trump  crashed the Federal Bank, bought all of the gold and now holds the keys  to creating a gold back currency, removing the fiat. The Federal Bank  and Treasury have basically merged. Trump is now the Chairman for the  global banking system with the people’s money. No longer will 99% of the  worlds wealth be owned by an evil, greedy and corrupt 1%, like the  Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros and Goldman families.

▪️Dozens  of the worlds most powerful CEO’s have stepped down.. why? Amazon,  Victoria’s Secret, Google, Disney, Microsoft, Groupon and over 1,300 of  the top CEO’s.. gone. This was before the crash, mind you.
 (What are they running from???)

▪️ Thousands of arrests have been made for child trafficking, human  trafficking and sex abuse.. but the media is not telling you that...  what are they hiding? Nurses are coming forward speaking publicly about  the fact they’re treating hundreds of children in hospitals right now..  not for Coronavirus but for malnutrition, some extremely deformed, and  all with extreme psychiatric damage due to trauma.

▪️ It’s widely known there are underground tunnel systems (research  D.U.M.B ) that have been used for decades to traffick people for sex  slaves and organ harvesting, across the globe. There is currently a  monumental military operation going down, lead by POTUS to uncover these  children, arrest those involved, and stop this evil once and for all.  Remember the earthquakes, in mentioned earlier?

What you are seeing is a war. An invisible war that Trump keeps taking about... *WWIII is a spiritual one*

It’s a war between Trump with his Secret Service against the elites, bankers and mainstream media. (& he’s winning)

A war between good and evil.

Pay attention to the bigger picture. Trump has arrested and caught more  pedophile and child trafficking rings in the world... but I bet you  didn’t know that because the mainstream (George Soros funded media) make  out that he’s a moron...

Trump will go down in history in the coming weeks.

There is no need to panic or have fear. This whole thing is working out  as it needs to for Trump and his team to remove the corruption and  power that has taxed your hard earned dollars, loaded your loans and  credit cards with interest and pulled wool over your eyes.. we have been  living as slaves to the system for long enough.

You’re going to see some big names get called out, to the point where you won’t want to believe it.

Oprah.
 Ellen.
 Obama.
 Gates.
 Clintons.
 Podesta.
 Hanks.
 Madonna.
 Gaga.

The list goes on and on and on...

If you still believe that 9/11 was a terrorist attack from Osama Bin  Ladin who trained donkeys to fly cessnas, which then magically upskilled  into Boeing’s and flew aluminium planes into 580m steel reinforced  towers that collapsed like a deck of cards, not to mention tower 7 which  was a block away but folded. (Let’s not forget the 6 seals who took  Osama down that were killed in a mysterious chopper crash. RIP  fellas).... you’re in for a wake up call...

Some of the big banks  WILL go bankrupt, they are already on their knees, Income tax WILL go  away and the elites will no longer rule you or the world.

Don’t believe me? Take what I say with a grain of salt but do the research for yourself.
 Personally, I would read the Clinton emails on Wikileaks. Once you read  those you’ll believe the rest. Many of the most powerful people are  more sick and evil than you could ever imagine.

Start listening to trumps daily press briefings.
 Read between the lines.
 WAKE UP!
 NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT’S COMING.

Our world is controlled by an elite group of psychopaths who are **ABOVE THE POLITICS, ABOVE THE LAW, ABOVE THE GOVERNMENT, AND ABOVE THE PEOPLE**. They answer to no one but God. The world you accept as reality is just an illusion. It is indeed the Matrix. The prison for our minds they created to control you from the shadows. An international criminal cabal that has infected all sections of society. It involves royalty, politicians, religious institutions, military generals, media giants, private corporations and secret societies. I’m talking about corruption at the highest echelons of power and above. Together they make up the 0.1% of humanity. These are the soulless parasites who control the world and wish to enslave humanity with the New World Order Agenda.

Covid-19 is the event the elite have chosen to initiate the New World Order. Coronavirus is just a fancy name for the common ﬂu, and Covid-19 has never been scientiﬁcally proven to exists. Seriously it hasn’t. The British government has admitted SARS COV 2 (Covid-19) **DOES NOT EXIST.** The reason they are not proving the virus is real is because I believe they plan to release virus into the population if people don't by their bulls\*it. Thats what the Rockefeller operation lockstep which simulates a global pandemic says anyway...

Moving on, the PCR testing kits are **NOT EFFECTIVE.** The inventor of the kits even came out and said that the PCR tests **CAN NOT** be used to isolate or identify a speciﬁc virus in the body. These testing kits are 85-90% false positives meaning 85-95% of the time, the results will come back positive. This is why they are issuing mass testing worldwide. The elite are using the “rise in cases” to inﬂate the numbers and give the illusion of global pandemic. **CASES DOES NOT EQUAL DEATHS.**

The mortality rate globally is normal. In a real pandemic the death rate would be sky high. It isn’t. Therefore, there is **NO PANDEMIC!** Just because the government and media tell you something, does not that what they are telling you is true. If I call you a moose are you suddenly a moose? As I’ve already mentioned numerous times, the elite control the world and the ﬂow of information. They control the government, media, and even the world health organisation. Yes, you read that right. There is not one institution in the world that they do not control. This is why it is so easy for them to push any narrative and control the hearts and minds of the population via the propaganda in the media.

So, if there is no pandemic, what’s causing the ﬂu like symptoms in the population? Well, I think it’s 5G. 5G Is an electromagnetic ﬁeld or electromagnetic wave. Similar to a radio wave. You can’t see the signal traveling through the air to play music in your car, but you know the signal is there for the radio to work. Same principle with 5G. 5G is electromagnetic radiation in the air which is a form of non-ionising radiation. The health risks associated with 5G technology is very clear. It is extremely harmful and detrimental to human health. It damages DNA, fertility, causes brain tumours, and is carcinogenic. Yes, it kills cells so they develop cancer.

**Now let me tell you the link between 5G and the SYMPTOMS of Covid-19.**

If you research the symptoms of Covid-19, then research the symptoms of electromagnetic radiation poisoning, (or hypo electric sensitivity) you will ﬁnd that they are **EXACTLY THE SAME!** What’s even more interesting is the link between the role out of 5G around the world, and the outbreak path of this alleged virus. It started in Wuhan China, then Italy, then Spain. **The EXACT SAME places where 5G was turned on!** Then if you look at what CITIES installed 5G since the start of the **PLANDEMIC,** they are the **WORST EFFECTED AREAS for what they call Covid-19!** Once is random, twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern. We most certainly have a pattern when it comes to the symptoms of Covid-19 and the connection with 5G.

**Let me tell you what this is all about and where they want to take humanity.**

Ultimately, their number one goal is to contaminate you with that vaccine. Inside the vaccine is **NANOTECHNOLOY.** Tiny little robots that are programmed to change, alter, and harvest your DNA. There is also something called Hydrogel. Hydrogel binds to the biology of your body and works in conjunction with the nano-tech. It is also a receiver of signals which means it can pick up frequencies in the airwaves from 5G. This technology can literally **CONTROL YOUR MIND AND EMOTIONS.**

Furthermore, heavy metals are in the vaccine such as aluminium, strontium, and barium, which is toxic to the human body. This all ties in with the satanic transhumanist agenda to merge man with machine. Once you take that vaccine you are not bound under natural law (Gods Law), as a divine living man/ woman. You become a chimera.

Essentially, an animal with two or more diﬀerent sets of DNA. You will no longer be human. There is even something called luciferase in the vaccine. **LUCIFER-RASE**. Could it be any more obvious! This is it the people, we are living in the end times. This is **THE MARK OF THE BEAST** as prophesied in biblical prophecy. Only believing in Jesus Christ can save you from what is coming.

**They want to get cash out of society and convert everyone over to a totally digital economy.** They want to know who you are, what your buying, and when you’re buying it. They want to implement a universal basic income to control all citizens of the world. They want to make you dependant on the state so they can rule over us as Satanic Overlords. This is why they have spent billions on 5G because 5G is the technological foundations for the future. It enables them to turn up the frequency and cause sickness in the population so they can blame it on a fake virus. 5G is the only type of technology capable of running the global digital economy which they have already started to roll out.

This ties in with the smart cities they are building, artiﬁcial intelligence, and the social credit score system to determine if you’re a “good citizen”. They want to turn the world into communist China with facial recognition and 24/7 mass surveillance of all citizens. Soon they will be implementing the Covid-ID biometric passport and digital vaccination certiﬁcate for travel. We won’t be able to do anything in society unless we comply to their oppressive, Nazi-like, inhumane, satanic regime.

Very soon they are going to switch oﬀ the global power grid at diﬀerent intervals in diﬀerent countries. They are going to blame it on hackers and call it a **“Cyber Pandemic”.** This is known as the **“Great Switch oﬀ”.** They have planned this decades in advanced. They made the world dependant on import and export so when they kill the grid the global food supply completely shuts down. This is how evil these children of the Fallen Angels are. Expect massive food shortages, worldwide city blackouts, riots, looting, and “order out of chaos”, the motto of the Illuminati.

**FOOD WILL BE USED AS THE LEVERAGE TO IMPLEMENT FORCED VACCINATIONS.** A digital vaccination identity card is the perfect way to keep a record of **FOOD RATIONS** for the entire population. They are piggy backing one fake crisis on top of the other to usher in the great reset and the takeover of humanity. Stock up on basic survival essentials. Food, water, warm clothing and some sort of power outlet. This is their plan people, welcome to The New World Order.

In conclusion, I really hate to be the bearer of bad news. I wish this wasn’t where the world was headed but unfortunately it is. Buckle up and get prepared because shit is going to hit the fan. It’s so important you share this information and keep spreading the knowledge. On a positive note the Covid-19 bullsh\*t has triggered **THE GREAT AWAKENING!**

Do not be fearful brothers and sisters, there is light at the end of the tunnel. We are all sons and daughters of God. Not the children of Fallen Angels who control the world as the elite. When God created everything, he gave them free will. He has to let the elite exercise their right to free will by enslaving mankind, if that’s how they which to express it. But, that does not mean he is going to let them get away with it.

This is why he sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for **ALL OF MANKIND**. That includes the elite. He knew this day was coming. Jesus will forgive anyone, even the elite and their twisted ideologies, if they repent of their sins and seek forgiveness from Jesus Christ for their wickedness.

If they reject Jesus and carry on with their Satanic Agenda, they will be dealt accordingly on the great day of judgment which is closer than you think. Trust me. I pray for you, all of mankind, and even the elite, that you all allow Jesus Christ into your hearts. Gods patience is wearing thin and this nightmare is almost over. Will you be given access to the eternal kingdom of God? Or will you reject Jesus and leave your fate in God’s hands. That choice ladies and gentlemen, is down to you, and you alone.

147,The Corrupt Govts of the World Are Hiding the Very Nature of Existence,131.0,wi1v0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wi1v0f/the_corrupt_govts_of_the_world_are_hiding_the/,50.0,1659830243.0,"Remote viewing, out of body experiences, psychic manipulation, psychotronics, heart and brain EMF, and metaphysics, are very real. 

If you're a person that needs scientific validation, quantum entanglement, quantum non-locality, and epigenetics all support this. Below are a few links to get started. DM me if you need more. What we call ""God"" is a unified field of consciousness that has been given countless names. Other names include: the quantum hologram, the quantum matrix, Source, The Absolute, Brahman, The Infinite Creator, etc. What we label it doesn't matter as words are fundamentally arbitrary. They are man's creation to attempt to label the reality we perceive. Problem is, they confine our thinking. We get caught up in definitions and labels arrogantly thinking we know it all. Truth is, we know very little. All knowledge is subjective as perception is inherently subjection. Constructed by us and based on our limited perceptions, experiences and previous constructs. This pulls away from staying present. All of creation emerges from this unified field. It is a thought responsive existence.  

\-The pleasurable “chills” or “goosebumps” (aka frisson) experienced when listening to music, watching movies, viewing art, dancing etc. is a sensation that is sustainable for long periods and increases in intensity with dedication. It is the sensation needed to enter altered states of consciousness known as the Jhanas as well as to self-induce out of body experiences from a meditative state (visualization techniques are also required for OBEs). It is a physiological indicator that serves as a guidepost for the quality of our thoughts and emotions. 

\-In the CIA analysis of the Gateway Process for consciousness it is described as “a self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a ‘current’ along the sensory cortex.” Linked below.  

\-During meditation, the peak intensity of the sensation is often called the ""rapture."" It can become so intense it is uncomfortable. Reaching this peak requires dramatically lowering our heart rate and sustaining it. This eliminates the bifurcation echo down aorta that comes with each heart beat ""so that the sound of the heart beat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately 7 times a second."" - See article below.  

\-Ever wonder why many genuine spiritual practitioners are able to meditate all day while choosing to live on the bare minimum? It is because learning to enter these conscious states places you in a state of love and bliss. You essentially become in sync, on the level of your brainwaves, with this unified field. The state of this field is unconditional love and acceptance of all things. We observe this in the universe. The universe aka ""God"" does not go around smiting rapists and murderers. All is accepted and loved unconditionally as we cannot know that which we do not experience. This is the structure of knowledge. The more we experience, the more we know and the less we fear until fear is gone entirely and we become one with the ""divine."" This is the evolution of consciousness. This bliss/unconditional love obviously cannot be achieved while in a state of fear, stress, or other negative emotions. This is why mastery of thoughts and emotional control is paramount. How long have wise men been speaking of these things for on this planet ? Thousands of years. The forgotten wisdom is now coming back during this Great Awakening/Remembering. Everything you experience, from the seemingly significant to the seemingly miniscule, has an impact on you. The more we suffer and experience in general, the more we can empathize. This is why suffering plays a role. In my experience, suffering can be a gift in disguise for this reason, although I went through a lot to come to this realization. It is experience needed for our growth on a conscious level. Without mistakes done to us and by us and the rendered suffering, there would be slower progress. This is further demonstrated by the Great Awakening occurring at this time of increased suffering worldwide. Suffering is a catalyst of empathy. Empathy is a catalyst of understanding. Understanding is a catalyst of acceptance. Acceptance is a catalyst of love and love is valuable in and of itself. Ultimately suffering is a catalyst for awakening, although it can take quite a bit of suffering depending on the person. Suffering forces the ego to yield and eventually break. We are here now for this very reason.  

\-This is also why detachment, non-judgementality, and surrender can induce ""religious"" experiences. People simply get too caught up in the ""religious"" aspects and devolve their own spiritual practice thinking their religion is the right one. This too is a manipulation of the corrupt churches of the world. ""God"" is the universe. Surrender to the universe is an enacting of positive faith, which itself is a reality altering mechanism through quantum entanglement. Faith can be both positive or negative because our collective thoughts create reality. You can have faith that negative things are going to happen. You can have faith that positive things are going to happen. Our current societal programming is designed to keep them predominantly negative, suppressing your positive thoughts and emotions. Thus allowing the pharma- military-industrial cartel to further spread division, turmoil and undue suffering all the while reaping profit and control. Nonetheless, the positive and negative are clearly tied together. 

Epigenetics shows that negative gene expressions occur with negative thinking. We all contain the potential genes expressions to be more cancer prone, more disease prone in general, more prone to being aggressive or “criminal,” more prone to anything negative, etc. Negative thinking caused by the trauma from our environment is what activates these gene expressions. Negative thinking is caused by how we perceive that environment. Thus if we believe our experience are negative and harmful, it will show in the manner in which are genes are expressed. This is why those labeled “criminals” tend to come from very traumatic backgrounds. This allows big pharma to continue its profiteering and manipulation. This also allows govt to keep making nonsensical laws, labeling more people “criminals,” putting them in jail while paying fines, while the prison system, which is supported by corporations, is able to put them to work for pennies. It is a form of modern slavery. 

\-If you pursue the sensation within yourself by attempting to feel it as much as possible (all day, every day if you are able), it builds in strength significantly over time to the point where it becomes a full body sensation with the pinnacle being at the crown of the skull. You must become your own experiment to determine what moves you emotionally as each individual’s set of beliefs and emotional reactions are unique. Allow your positive thoughts and emotions to surge. It is irrelevant if you perceive these thoughts to be false in “reality.” That is the point of the manipulation occurring because our collective thoughts are constructing reality. Shifting your beliefs both consciously and subconsciously will shift your interpretation of an experience, or rather, your perception of it. You have this power as a co-creator. 

\-One fundamental key to the sensation is to achieve states of genuine, positive emotions such as love, gratitude, inspiration, courage, joy, unity etc. Therefore, anything that enables you to feel these emotions can work. Conversely, anything that prevents these, may prevent your sensation. Control of thought is the key.  

\-It is important to take a non-judgmental perspective of all things, including yourself, in order to cultivate acceptance and love within yourself. Try to be honest with yourself at all times. Trust your feelings and intuitions.  

\-This is your Chakra Energy, Kundalini, Prana, Mana, Qi, Chi, Holy Spirit, life force, vibration, and intelligent energy among others depending on your cultural lens. It also has an electro-magnetic element, which is why your hair will stand up when experiencing intense bursts. Both the heart and brain generate an EMF. Both the heart and stomach contain neurons similar to the brain's. 

There are not many resources that discuss this sensation directly, so I can only speak from personal experience, as that's all any of us can do. I do not claim to have all the answers. Since it can be self-induced with positive emotions, it requires we release any/all negativity, which takes time. Anything we believe to be negative is merely based on our perceptions. Nothing is inherently ""bad"" or ""good,"" these perceptions are simply based on our personal/subjective belief systems, or personal paradigms. Once we realize this, we can then begin to release trauma both consciously and subconsciously by shifting those beliefs. This indicates a shift of our consciousness. Frisson will begin to occur to a broader range of stimuli as we lose interest in judgement and expectation. As Socrates stated ""I know that I know nothing."" The ultimate goal being to fall in love with experience itself. This is why I believe it to be a guide. It is the intelligent energy of the universe aka ""God"" coming through us. It goes hand in hand with our mental and spiritual health, as well as our physical health as all 3 are inevitably tied. It also indicates a development of our nervous systems as we release the bodily tensions/anxieties caused by our current state of judgment/expectation and past trauma. I believe it can also lead us to our true purpose in life. I recommend meditation, forgiving anyone/anything you feel have wronged you, try to stay only in the present as it is the only thing there is. The past is gone. The future only comes one moment at a time. Truly surrender and trust the universe's plan for you. We live in an existence where a cause is able to have an effect. Dark and light are tied together as they are opposite ends of the same spectrum. We are all one.  

\-This cover up of the fundamental nature of existence is at the root of many other so called ""conspiracies."" Many ultimately lead down this road. ET's, cryptids, paranormal, corrupt MSM, constant polarization of social and political issues, etc. It keeps us divided and, more importantly, manipulates our thought patterns that construct reality while they maintain power, profit and control. We are all constantly emitting energy. It's critical we all mind our thoughts. Stay strong. Stay positive. Never forget, you are an immortal being that is one with the unified field of consciousness. The only thing you have to fear is fear itself as this is a thought responsive universe. We cannot defeat fear and anger by spreading more fear and anger. This is antithetical to our vibratory nature and only further divides us. Spread the love. Give a helping hand. “Love thy enemy.” Choose to see the beauty of this intelligent, incomprehensible existence and you will reap the reward of a better world. We do this together. Everyone and everything is The Creator. I love to all.

It's long, was difficult to revisit, but I had to get the message out.

And how my “long-haul” Covid-19 symptoms turned out to be Microwave Radiation Illness. As a disclaimer: please know this is NOT Covid denial.

After two years of growing sicker than I ever had been – and for that “sickness” I contributed to being a “long hauler” to vanish after removing myself from the problem, the only logical conclusion I can make is one that no one wants to hear, but it’s one that tech companies are fervently trying to smother.

It’s an uncomfortable truth, but I need you to recognize that even “normal,” everyday exposure to these signals can take a devastating toll on your health, even threaten your life – like it did to mine.

That’s why I’m speaking out to warn you.

**Please hear my story.**

I was a former salesperson for one of the biggest telecom companies in the nation, and took some time off to devote to my kids and continue my education. My family and I moved into a home that was less than 1000 feet away from multiple cell towers and high-voltage power lines. On top of that, my bedroom had two smart meters mounted on the exterior wall, the presence of which I was unaware of then.

Since I was settling into the mom role with a toddler and new baby, I didn’t leave the house as much as I used to. After about six months, I noticed that I started to feel “off” in a way that I couldn’t put my finger on, like I couldn’t settle down physically or mentally, even in a quiet house. It was exhaustion spiked with restlessness, sort of like when you’re on 3 hours of sleep, slam an espresso and still try to catch a nap, and then the exhaustion would wash over me in random, unexpected waves.

While I learned to adapt to this high tide of fatigue, a perpetual cloud of brain fog settled over my mind. Communication became difficult, as I often found myself searching through the thick cognitive shroud to string together the words to form the simplest of sentences. But like most tired parents, I attributed it to crappy sleep from tiny children wailing during random hours of the night. *I guess this is just what two kids feels like*, I often found myself rationalizing.

By the end of the first year, **the concern that something worse, something external was affecting me repeatedly crept up in the back of my mind**. 

Like an intuitive itch, it would sneak up in the quiet moments of the night, while I’d lie there wondering why I could feel my heart beating faster and harder than it should be. But I brushed it off.

As stressful as life was, I knew parenting shouldn’t feel like…*this*. Despite being extremely healthy beforehand, I had about five infections that required antibiotics within that first year.

I also began to literally feel sick on a regular basis. The lymph nodes on the sides of my neck would hurt, but every time I was sure I was coming down with something, the discomfort and muscle fatigue would evaporate without a trace. And that was the problem: **there weren’t any outward measurable signs**. **But the underlying sensation felt like an electric current jolting my nervous system**. Like constant endocrine fatigue but always anxious and on high alert. The smallest of disruptions or provocations would send my heart thundering and my head spinning.

For this reason, I began to withdraw from the few social outlets I still had. Despite my formerly outspoken nature, I avoided confrontation because I either couldn’t articulate my thoughts or couldn’t bear how erratic my heart would quiver when on edge. I couldn’t even bear intensive exercise anymore.

Headaches also became a regular occurrence: they would just come and go, leaving my mind even more spacey and vacant than before.

The brain fog evolved and I became oddly irrational. I started petty fights with my husband that were spurred by spontaneous bursts of rage and disorganized thoughts that would fall apart as quickly as they’d form. 

**Amidst this slow descent, the most alarming symptom was my heart.** I already mentioned it would beat faster, harder and more abruptly, but now it became concerning. Instead of a few intermittent skipped beats or anxiety, it’d start galloping in my chest unprovoked, and do so periodically throughout the night, or even beat out of sync. Interestingly, **this was the room with both smart meters**, which must have been bad because even my husband complained of the same thing, though to a lesser extent.

A few doctors visits had yielded an elevated blood pressure reading, but all other tests came back normal and I was dismissed. I think, in total though, I had about half a dozen doctor’s visits related to symptoms to which no one could attribute a cause.

I’d never suffered from insomnia before, but it took longer and longer to fall asleep, and when I did, it was dreamless and fitful. For the first time, my ears starting ringing: sometimes I’d also hear a popping, static crackling in the back of my head. I assumed it was tinnitus, and blamed it on the shrieks of small children.

And then, some days I’d wake up, feel perfectly energetic, and chastise myself for obsessing over my health.

I also started to become oddly sensitive to alcohol and coffee: it seemed I couldn’t ingest anything that’d perk me up or calm me down anymore. After a year of nursing, though, I thought maybe my tolerance to beer had just dropped, but that wouldn’t justify the unease after one or two sips.

Even Covid began, my world and my functioning were so shaken, **I worried I had dementia** – my working memory became so poor, I could hardly hold a conversation without losing my thoughts as they verbalized. I felt like I was operating through a dense fog that dulled my perception, yet I was constantly on edge. It just scrambled my entire day-to-day routine and robbed me of the resources I needed to provide for my family, let alone reap any joy from those early years everyone says you’re supposed to cherish.

**But here's where Covid made this whole debacle so convoluted.**

Or at least, I was convinced it was Covid. Mid March of 2020, it was like a switch was flipped. No one else in my house had any visible signs, and since it happened early during the ""test kit shortage,"" all I had to go off of were laundry lists of speculative symptoms that included everything from conjunctivitis to fatigue, nausea to chest pain - even a rapid heart rate - all of which I had around that time. Ignoring the slow build-up that had previously occurred, even a doctor retroactively ""diagnosed"" me because everything lined up so well.

Due to the industrial-grade sludge of misinformation spewing from our media outlets, for the next six months, with complete conviction, I attributed the rest of my progressively deteriorating condition to ""long-hauler"" Covid because my symptoms had a direct connection to it as an aggravating, if not originating factor.

The funny thing is that I had started to read about the dangers of cell phones, wifi near sleeping areas, things like that, especially since 5g towers were actively being installed nationwide. I recognized they were harmful, but in the same way sugar or alcohol was harmful: like, they were ""bad"" but figured they were the ""not really a big deal"" kind of bad.

I never considered those signals strong enough to dismantle my entire life. But a designer virus that had escaped from a foreign lab that was on track to wipe out a sizable portion of our population? Now that... yes, that definitely had the potential to cause widespread suffering.

But I still knew it wasn't the *original* source. Doctors had already ruled out everything from thyroid, to autoimmune disease, to food allergies, they couldn't treat what they couldn't record - but because I uttered the word ""anxiety"" after describing in length symptoms like hives, heart problems and hair loss, I was referred to a psychiatrist.

It makes me sick to my stomach to think what would have happened if I had followed their advice and accepted whatever medication they would have thrown at me. 

So I had to investigate further. 

Yes, I checked for the obvious: mold, carbon monoxide leaks; harsh chemicals being used in or near the house - even meth; plus, other aspects of my health. The funny thing was I was so irrational I was convinced for several months I had celiac after testing negative. In hindsight, it was a coping mechanism that provided an explanation for what Covid couldn't, and even warranted the small, burning rash that began to appear on my right forearm, which, to me, was visible evidence that something had altered my biology.

I basically lived like an irrational hypochondriac until the week of the turning point when my body was finally pushed over the edge.

In the preceding days, I thought I was coming down with Covid 2.0 or, like, a weird relapse. Same symptoms as back in March. Until Saturday night came around.

And then my heart started racing. But not like it had done before. It was like a helicopter taking off in my chest, and it didn't quit. 

It sounds like a panic attack, but I cannot stress enough that although it induced anxiety, and actually caused panic attacks thereafter, it *in and of* *itself* was not a panic attack. Though no doctor was there to diagnose, I later discovered tachycardiac spells or SVTs like this are a common, yet terrifying and even potentially life-threatening symptom of sensitivity to wireless signals. Panic attacks also don't last three to four hours.

*Maybe this is it - maybe it's a heart attack*, I remember thinking as I weighed my options over driving to the ER. It was almost midnight and my husband fallen asleep after a few drinks - and after umpteen EKGs - why bother? For three grueling hours, I paced around; employed relaxation techniques; distracted myself; wept profusely. By around 3am, heart still thundering as angrily, I frantically scribbled down all the passwords to my accounts and curled up in bed assured that I wouldn't be consciously enduring this much longer, regardless of whether it was temporary or final. 

The days following that traumatic night were no better.

The epinephrine surge from that previous night drained my remaining energy reservoir, and exhaustion made me catatonic as I began slipping into literal psychotic-like states. It was like my head was stuffed inside a fishbowl with the pressure of a deep-sea dive. My senses were blunted; I didn't even know what was happening in the external world; all I could perceive was a physical veil of disorientation, tingling pain, confusion, and spikes of anxiety cranking my nervous system into overdrive - and the worst of all - **it felt like I couldn't breathe. It was as if every cell in my body was screaming for air and I needed to claw out of my skin just to get enough oxygen.**

These horrific episodes would come and go, night or day, and the apprehension that preceded them swelled into panic attacks and magnified their influence tenfold. I had been completely stripped of my autonomy. 

My life felt like a psychological horror film – the kind where the protagonist is pushed to the brink of death while everyone around doubts them or questions their sanity. Since there were so few overt symptoms, no one else ever saw anything more than someone who looked chronically anxious or tired. But I, as a person, was long gone. My personality had sunken in so far, I decayed to a shell of a human being.

I just remember plunging into dysphoria; I went days without eating, mostly to prevent the heart issues and anxiety that'd follow a meal. My small frame shed 15 pounds. I would just hold my head and sob; and when doing so, I'd run my fingers through my hair, and they'd return wrapped in dozens of strands. There wasn't a single part of me that was unaffected, and I had never felt so hopeless and bewildered towards a mystery illness that was bludgeoning my will to live.

At this point, if I hadn't been on the brink of discovering the cause, I would have taken my own life. Believe me, anyone in a similar position would have contemplated the same thing. 

**Because literally, every day, I felt I was dying, and I didn't know why. And no one could help me.** 

By now, I had fanatically researched every medical condition, and **the only one my symptoms that matched – and they did, to the letter – were those of “microwave radiation sickness”** or EMF hypersensitivity. It seemed outrageous, but I was near rock bottom and desperate, so I let the possibility marinate in the neural soup sloshing around inside my skull while my husband and I decided to escape town for a week.

On each of those two occasions, both of which were far from all wireless sources, I noticed that blanketing grip of agony loosening enough for me to relax again. And finally, the lightbulb flickered on**.**

## For the first time in over a year, I felt markedly improved.

Once the source of my suffering became irrefutable, I remember weeping on the way back home because I couldn’t bear the thought of returning to that hell.

I looked for a new place to live immediately, and it was hard since now we had to find somewhere affordable but without orange poles or cell towers in sight. Right before we moved, I bought a decent EMF reader to test the strength of ambient radio and microwaves. I was afraid of what I’d find, and for good reason. **The signals in my duplex reached 20+ times the most liberal limits** set by independent researchers.

Even then, I was still terrified that moving wasn’t the answer, that nothing would change, but since I’ve placed a reasonable distance between myself and all wireless transmitters, my symptoms evaporated – the gripping pain, the erratic heart rate, the brain fog, even the rash disappeared and hair loss has stopped. Obviously, it wasn’t overnight, but over the course of a few months, nearly everything reversed.

And of course, the “Covid” symptoms vanished too. But just to confirm my suspicions, I got a T-cell test, which indicated that I had never even contracted it.

## What had lingered, however, was the literal trauma of that experience.

For the first time in my life, I have been left with severe, lingering anxiety, and what I’m beginning to assume is a permanent and severe sensitivity to EMF, which now means no living, working, or spending too much time in crowded locations; highly restricted use of my phone; no wifi; and a complete change in career path.

And this is all because **regulations on wireless technology are so lenient they might as well be nonexistent** in spite of the accumulating research proving these unprecedented levels of EMFs are unquestionably hazardous.

THIS is the real pandemic, especially for the younger generations. And believe me, it’s a hell of a lot harder to social distance from the electrosmog with which technocrats intend to blanket the entire globe.

This is why I’m imploring you to learn more about this silent, yet burgeoning concern before it’s too late.

So please, stop using your wireless ear buds.

Plug your pc into the modem.

And help me fight for safety regulations for the sake of our future – and for protections for those of us with EHS trying to survive in this inescapably wireless world.",conspiracy,5G

This made me suspicious. Why is the MSM so aggresive when it comes to 5G? And why are they so quick to say that 5G radiation is completely harmless?

As 5G poles were being deployed everywhere around the world in 2018-2019, more and more people started questioning it's effects on the enviroment. Then in 2020 the media created a false conspiracy theory: they started writting articles claiming people are saying that 5G started the coronavirus pandemic to make questioners look completely crazy. This was done to both shut them up as well as to make other people laugh at them: ([example 1](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-53285610), [example 2](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/24/21231085/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-covid-facebook-youtube), [example 3](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/14/tech/5g-health-conspiracy-debunked/index.html), [example 4](https://www.bbc.com/news/53191523), [example 5](https://www.wired.com/story/the-rise-and-spread-of-a-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory/)).

In reality, nobody said that 5G caused the pandemic, but people who control the MSM can easily control the perception of the masses by creating false stories. And they did. Obviously, 5G has nothing to do with the virus but my post is about analyzing the direct effects of 5G on the environment(trees,plants,animals,humans).

We have a self-guiding thought process that rationalises what we deem in the ""realm of possibility"" for the reality we encounter day to day. 
Our technology connects us in a way it has never before - we get real time updates from our loved ones, world news never stops, our newsfeeds and timelines fill with a constantly connected stream of information we judge to ""make sense"". 

At what point do YOU draw the difference between things that have been occurring *coincidentally* to then occur *on purpose*?

We look to the people in our immediate lives to ground us in reality - factual, trustworthy accounts from people we've built love and rapport with. 
Whilst COVID-19 is a very real world health crisis, looking online in in real life a collective of us have come to realise this is just *one* aspect of what is going to happen at a world scale - the likes of which the current generation hasn't seen.  A control of The Fear brings with it the psychological power over the population AND how well they follow the orders of their countries government. 

You've noticed everyone feels a bit ""off""? That people are tense? Perhaps you feel a big shift is coming but you just can't put it into words? 
Hold on to that gut feeling, let your subconscious mind come through just that a bit more..

It's my belief over the month of April, we're going to have reports on social media via peoples profiles, voice clips, videos, and articles about something **awful** happening in our society. Paedophilia, human trafficking, slavery, abuse, torture. All terrible things we want to deny could happen in our daily lives that the public **does** know is occurring amongst those in power (Think Weinstein, Epstein, Prince Andrew - search up lists of the affiliates) and yet...we get no updates on investigations into these crimes. The public is kept out of the realm of knowing the details of what should be extremely pressing cases. 

My first suggestion is to read this whole twitter thread by Ex-founder of Wikipedia, Larry Sanger - to get yourself grounded in the scale of these events. 
https://twitter.com/lsanger/status/1244733672240054275
Horrible things to imagine, but very real atrocities that have been occurring now WITH evidence people have been discovering online and sharing. Yes Pizzagate, yes Clinton corruption, yes satanic cults and child trade.

Next: Sidney Powell touches on the *tangible* and *shareable* evidence that's been found linking those monstrous claims.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTV1Y_QuZOM (~55min, Sidney Powell discusses Obama did allow Hilary to use this ""secret"" server) 
""[...]There is a lot that can be prosecuted I have no doubt on that laptop."" - what kind of stuff? why has the public not been made aware of this? Ask these questions.

To get to my main theory on what this all means: I believe we are being locked down in order to prepare for the backlash of when this news gets to **all** of us. When the doubt in the Government, the Media, Hollywood is so high we don't know who to trust - causing mayhem amongst those who haven't woken up to this truth. The amount of uncertainty and fear right now in the public directed at COVID-19 is a misdirection for what is to come. On a subconscious level we are all deeply connected and aware more than we recognise that slowly the world is unfurling what justice is about to get underway. 

**New York New York**   

First, lets open with New York and the Empire State Building. In a display meant to honour health care workers, it lit up in red with a whirling siren light. 
https://nypost.com/2020/03/31/new-yorkers-baffled-over-unsettling-empire-state-building-siren-display/ (MAR 31/2020) 
Now yes, they can say this is for that purpose, but subconsciously we all know - **this looks way more ominous than it does comforting** as other people comment in the article. Something bigger is going down in New York soon, and the ESB is ready to act as the warning beacon.

Now, pair that if you will with the USNS Comfort being made to dock in New York in order to treat COVID-19. (MAR 30/2020)
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/politics/coronavirus-comfort-hospital-ship-new-york.html 
Now, MSM has been telling us about COVID-19 + Cruise ships = everyone getting infected on board, so why is it that Trump would send a boat vessel to NY? Think what you want about Trump, but a man with that many advisers, in charge of so many large scale operations around the world would *clearly* have more sense to do that, unless it was for another reason... 

YT Clip: Trump signs order to combat human trafficking (FEB 1/2020)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVyyNi0ZjdI
Trump has always held the firm moral obligation to end human trafficking. As president, the MSM (which we know the corruption runs deep) paints him to be this bumbling crude buffoon and has no idea what he's doing, but for someone to be so passionate and genuine in their call to end such a horrific practice? He must have that deeply held belief system we too can relate to on a fundamental personal level. 

Now hold on to that subconscious inclination that maybe there are dots to connect there.. 

Next, listen to this audio clip --> 
Soundcloud Clip: Nurse making a statement there are cases of malnourished/deformed/abused children that have been held in tunnels as sex slaves, now being given shelter in these pop-up hospitals in NY supposedly for ""COVID-19"", as well as the SC poster attesting to this being trustworthy testimony. (APR 1/2020) 
https://soundcloud.com/heath-motley-820983133/nurse-mentions-children-saved 
EDIT: new upload https://soundcloud.com/sarrby/nurse-mentions-children-saved-in-new-york

We ask several questions - does this sound like a genuine account from someone? Can you hear fear and sadness in her voice? Can you hear the urgency and credence in the mans voice when he attests to this being **real** information? 

and finally, look at these twitter posts made (APR1-2020) 
https://twitter.com/LieslSchoonraad/status/1245357369267073024
""That is a TPN. Aka fatpack

I could go on and on about how this connects to the Fed being removed, military actions being put into place, 5G towers, ID2020, removal of civil liberties, the Elites that run the world, Secret Societies, but that would be too much information in one sitting for anyone to process, so please look at the issues I've raised in this text *in your own time* and continue to go out and discover what is happening to our planet and us the people. Maybe smoke a bit and really let the mind wander. 

Be prepared for a few hard weeks as we find out this information slowly, as we go into this next stage of understanding our place in society and how we've had the wool pulled over our eyes as long as we can remember, and we didn't even notice it. 

When the reality around is up-heaved like this, with The Fear, THAT is the real killer. The real divider. The real test that our society as about to face. How well we can understand the truth and trust that people won't *direct this fear unto one another*. Big players in the world are making shifts that not everyone is ready to confront. Talk to your loved ones, share information, keep calm and enjoy what you're doing in the present, and just have the knowledge with you that we're going to see a very different world soon.",conspiracy,5G

Im China, the biometrics are insane. They can pick you out of a crowd and identify you by your gait, facial recognition, heat signature, idiosyncratic movements, etc. 

This, combined with A.I. Deep learning, and sensors everywhere and they don’t need a chip. They can pick you out of a crowd in a disguise, with a mask and track you all over the planet.

Tonight, around 2am, I took my dog for a walk around my local area, as per usual.

As I'm walking down one of the streets I usually walk down I hear two beeps. I turn around and look for where the noise has come from and realise I've just walked past a lamp post. I look up and see that there is brand new security hardware attached to said lamp post, in the form of a box with a large antenna and camera. Was it activated by my motion of walking past? It detected me?

&#x200B;

I continue my walk along my usual route and I realise that there are two massive protruding orb cameras around 100m apart from each other on this particular street, brand new. I do this route every day with my dog and it felt like I was like playing real life spot the difference. One of the cameras was even orbiting around, scanning.

&#x200B;

I've seen posts from others in the UK about new hardware being installed in their areas, and due to how long I've lurked on this sub, especially as of recently, and in light of the lockdowns, In the back of my mind I've been wondering whether I'd see anything, from cameras, 5g, police, etc, and there it was, smack bang in my face, I was incredulous. I immediately felt like I wanted to move.

&#x200B;

Whoever installed this shit has been working overtime and they've issued ""lockdown"" for good reason. You can't sit here straight faced and tell me this is in the interest of ""public safety"" - this is surveillance, plain and simple. I guess the bit that I don't get is that a lot of people are wearing face masks right now, so peoples identities are going to be heavily obscured, though I also appreciate that once this corona stuff blows over, which it will, those things are here to stay.

Leaked Canadian email. You will own nothing and be happy.

My thoughts? In the US specifically, something like this could occur/begin within the month, coming into the fall/regular flu season. Natural Vitamin D levels will drop and regular flu season will roll around. If ADE is real, which it is appearing to be so, it would not be a stretch to expect a number of people to experience cytokine storm and die.

Not saying this is definitive, but given the videos it's a possibility for one or multiple points becoming true just like Event 201 did. Here is our potential future;

1- Delta continues to ""spike"" as more nurses/doctors quit. Claims that hospitals are overburdened circulate even more than they are right now. More propaganda and child abuse will occur. [ADE](https://sciencewithdrdoug.com/2020/08/01/is-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-ticking-time-bomb/) will [kick in](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/potential-covid-vaccine-related-ticking-time-bomb/) as people naturally encounter an actual flu virus.

2- Justification for reinstatement of lockdowns/potentially mandates roll in upon FDA approval

3- Rioting occurs/possible Civil War

4- Cyberpan/Electric grid hits right when things boil over

5- Mass Chaos occurs

6-  Military/Govt operates within time of civil unrest to pick off and  track the resistant and/or hope a number of the population simply choke  out with time

7- Gates and crooks get closer to their quota for maintaining humanity under 500,000,000 (Georgia Guidestones)

8- With time, completely destabilized US and disarmed global population = easier to instate One World Government/NWO

9- Those resistant will be picked off with time and culled

10- Welcome to the merging of 1984/Brave New World and global enslavement

The key in this is to fight now. We still retain a pocket of freedom. Not all of us are trackable. Yet.

Before fall, before they shut down, before they launch the [Cyberpandemic](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/u0IAAMXQATlRa6be/s-l400.jpg) that is supposedly going to hack these systems and shut off the electric grid. Texas was a test. Keep spreading the word, if they go through with this, they will want us to commit the 2nd Civil War and kill each other for resources as they will be shutting off the power/water/internet as they attempt to officially bring America down once and for all. This will depopulate America. This will then be much easier to actually instate the [New World Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ohnhyz/today_is_the_first_full_day_of_the_new_world/), unlike the rhetoric heard from Australia just one month ago.

**1.  Myth #1 - There is a single central illness**

John Rapoport says its better than I could in [this article](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/03/30/people-dying-equals-coronavirus-an-engineered-virus/).

""As I discovered in 1987, when I was researching AIDS, the basic epidemic con involves grouping all sorts of people and groups who are suffering from different traditional diseases, environmental toxicities, and certain new NON-VIRUS conditions UNDER ONE UMBRELLA LABEL. And then saying they’re all sick because of one virus. That is the central illusion.""

The link below is an old documentary and it has fantastic information. It shows how the same basic scam was done with AIDS. If you have the time, I highly, highly recommend it. This is 100% the same thing happening now with the ""new Covid-19 virus"".

[https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hiv-aids-fact-or-fraud/](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hiv-aids-fact-or-fraud/)

This is why the ""outbreak"" in Italy and the ""outbreak"" in China look fundamentally different. Because they are two different completely illnesses, stitched together by the propaganda to look like one single ""disease"".

This idea of a single label describing lots of illnesses in reality is further propped up by a PCR test. Inventor Kerry Mulis says the test does *not* work to diagnose an infectious disease. More details on why the test sucks giant big donkey balls [here](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/03/30/corona-creating-the-illusion-of-a-pandemic-through-diagnostic-tests/).

Using the test which literally does not prove or show anything, they can show a false spread and a false pandemic. In short...

More tests = more ""positives"" = more reason to be afraid = more controls = more money made.

With the PCR test the numbers will keep going up.

Interestingly, with 60 cycles of PCR test, it will give 100% false positive. Yes ""you"" will test positive if they just do a lot of cycles.

Dr. Thomas Cowan gives a [great explanation of this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3LgrcDAlJs). He describes exactly to prove an ""infectious disease"" and how and why this was never done with Covid-19.

This is also why ""the virus keeps spreading"" (through fake PCR test numbers) and yet total deaths from last year in those same areas are exactly the same.

They have only reclassified and relabeled the same diseases of yesterday.

The single label for multiple illnesses has been programmed into us for 20 years.

It is why for 20+ years they have been trying to scare the sheep with Mad Cow Disease, West Nile, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Zika, Ebola, Ecoli, Salmonella, Influenza, Measles, HIV/AIDS, etc etc

The mainstream media didn't just get bought and paid for in the last 4 weeks. It has always been that way.

This ""random event"" was planned.... for a long time.

And not understanding myth #1 leads to a passive acceptance of myth #2...

&#x200B;

**2. Myth #2 - There is a single cause and it must be Covid-19**

There is not one single cause.

It is just made through propaganda to look that way.

Because if you believe you are looking at a single underlying illness with only a single underlying cause...

....it can only be ""the oogey boogey deadly gonna end the world and kill all our health workers"" virus...

...and we MUST take your rights away as a response.

Which is the whole point of this.

Most people ask a good question, ""If it isn't an infectious disease and it's caused by 5G, why would it happen in areas that don't have 5G?""

It's a great question.

And it is because there are literally dozens or perhaps even hundreds of underlying factors.

Wuhan and Northern Italy just happen to have some of the most polluted air on planet Earth. Both have a history of respiratory problems. Not just in 2020.

The most common factors of disease in both humans and animals:

1. Negative Thinking/Nocebo
2. Environmental Toxicity
3. Electromagnetic Fields
4. Nutritional Deficiencies.

Just think Scurvy ""spread"" too... and it was actually just vitamin C deficiency, which they cured by eating limes.

After Hiroshima was dropped, disease in Japan ""spread"" too... and maybe, just maybe nuclear radiation was a factor (and getting bombed for years).

And the power of the mind... Everyone knows about placebo. However, few know of its opposite power ""nocebo"".

There was a guy in the early 1900's who accidentally got locked in a train refrigeration unit. He froze to death overnight. This was confirmed in an autopsy. He also had a journal with him and wrote down his last words.

Only there was a problem.

They found out the refrigeration unit hadn't been functioning for a long, long time. It wasn't on. He literally froze to death because the power of the mind. He believed he was freezing to death and so his mind created that reality in his body.

So just think what all that media fear porn is doing to the average person.

Nocebo.

So yes any man generated electromagnetic field like 5G is harmful to any organic being.

It's why bees have already started dropping dead in large numbers around the towers. If it's killing bees, what do you think it will do to you?

And if it was perfectly fine and dandy for you, what would be the harm in them letting you have an open frank discussion about it?

Also, notice a ""deadly virus"" isn't on the list of causative factors.

That is a big, big part of the propaganda.

Do your own research on what a virus has proven to ""cause"". It is a deep rabbit hole with an absence of actual hard science to back it. [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcBXMWho3aE) is a good place to start.

Animals in nature almost never get diseases like cancer, diabetes, etc. Except in areas where they have been heavily, heavily polluted.

When this is all over and the oogey boogey virus didn't wipe out all of planet Earth, most people will believe that ""yay social distancing worked"".

""Hooray for big government!""

""Hooray for tyranny!""

But in reality it is just very well orchestrated propaganda.

Typical problem - reaction - solution.

&#x200B;

**I also want to add something else...**

Don't buy into the fear koolaid that everyone else is drinking.

The real key to this ""conspiracy"" is that they don't want you to know that you are the creator of your own reality.

They must enforce separation, fear, and division at every corner.

They must make you fear that which is outside yourself.

They must make you believe that a virus (which has never even been isolated) is more powerful than your own ability to self heal.

That is why they continue to downplay the idea that you can do anything about your own immunity through exercise, sleep, eating well, fresh air, positive mindset, etc etc.

That is why an injection of heavy metals and untested chemical cocktails from outside yourself is ""the only protection"". Or the nauseating hero worship of Bill Gates.

Of course, that is all total bullshit.

You are more powerful than any control.

You are the creator.

You are love.

You are infinite.

You are timeless.

Own that shit.

**Graphene oxide in vaccines**

Pablo Campra Madrid, a professor at the University of Almeria in Spain, released an interim report ""Measurement of Graphene Oxide in Aqueous Suspension""  pointing out that he found the presence of graphene in the Pfizer vaccine in the laboratory. He also consulted with many medical experts and world-renowned doctors, all of which confirmed the report.

Then, former Pfizer employee and current pharmaceutical and medical device industry analyst Karen Kingston said in a filing she submitted that there is a large amount of graphene oxide in the new coronavirus vaccine, and she called on everyone not to get vaccinated  Kingston suspects that graphene oxide is not mentioned in the vaccine patent because it is toxic to humans. She said it is very difficult to find these nano-graphenes, but they are 100% there.

&#x200B;

**What is graphene oxide?**

Graphene oxide is the oxide of graphene and is an intermediate in the process of mass production of graphene. So what is graphene? It is a new type of nanomaterial that was discovered in 2004, and its discoverer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.

Graphene is a two-dimensional nanomaterial composed of a layer of carbon atoms tightly packed in a hexagonal honeycomb structure. Its thickness is at the atomic level, only one carbon atom thick. After being injected into the human body, it can freely enter and exit human cells and tissues.

Graphene has many magical properties and is known as the ""king of new materials"". It is the thinnest material, only one atom thick; it is the strongest material, 200 times stronger than steel; it is also a superconductor, with 1.6 times the conductivity of silver and 13 times the thermal conductivity of copper, It has ultra-high carrier mobility, and the electron mobility at room temperature is 10 times higher than that of silicon material.

Graphene is an ideal material for electrochemical biosensors. It can sensitively capture the bioelectricity of the human body. By sticking graphene on the human skin, it can accurately collect physiological data such as blood sugar, ECG, EEG, and EMG. . This has now been put into clinical application. Graphene materials can also interact with a range of biomolecules to transmit electrochemical, electrical or optical signals.

A study released by the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom on January 29, 2016 showed that researchers successfully implanted graphene into the brain of mice and directly connected it with neurons to intercept and transmit neural signals.

Researchers at the University of Cambridge and colleagues in Italy and Spain conducted related experiments using mouse brain cell cultures and found that graphene materials can perfectly connect with brain neurons, and these neurons can transmit electrical signals normally after connection. Adverse reactions will occur.

These graphene electrodes, which are directly connected to the brain or neurons, can intercept human brain waves or neural signals and transmit them to the outside world. For example, robots, computers or other AI devices, after receiving human brain wave signals, these external AI devices will act according to human thinking instructions, directly controlled by human thoughts, and become an external part of the human body.

That is to say, this technology can be extended to become an interface for exchanging information between the human brain and external AI digital devices, that is, Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

&#x200B;

**Brain-computer interface**

Elon Musk founded a brain-computer interface company called Neuralink in the United States in 2016 to develop human-computer interaction technology, and it has achieved success.

In early April last year, Musk’s Neuralink company released a video to the outside world, showing a macaque that successfully implemented brain-computer interface technology using consciousness to control a computer to play a game of “mind ping pong”. Last year, Musk showed the outside world a pig that implemented brain-computer interface technology, and successfully intercepted and read the pig's brainwave signals.

Musk believes that people have actually become ""cyborgs"" due to the proliferation of smartphones, computers, and apps, and they have a third ""digital layer.""

That is to say, when the brain-computer interface technology is popularized for human society, human beings will directly control all external AI digital devices and programs with their thoughts. For example, use your mind to control mobile phones, computers, robots, etc. As long as you move your mind, the mobile phone will automatically turn on and off, make calls, connect to the Internet to upload and download information, etc.; you can also use your mind to manipulate the ""Internet of Things"", which is all Internet-connected objects and devices.

For example, just think about it, the lights at home will be on, the air conditioner will be turned on and adjusted to the temperature you want, and the car will drive automatically according to your thoughts... In this way, humans can connect with the AI ​​digital level through brainwave signals, so as to Digitize people and connect them to the Internet, making each person directly a point of contact on the Internet.

Not only that, through this brain-computer interface technology to capture and transmit human brain wave signals, it can also directly connect people to each other, so that people can directly transmit each other's thoughts, memories, emotions, etc., To achieve telepathy, idea communication, and no longer need language and other means of expression.

Musk said that Neuralink's brain-computer interface technology can allow humans to transmit concepts to each other through telepathy, exist in a ""preserved state"" after death, and implant human memories into robots. He admits that he is delving into the realm of science fiction. He said that human memory can be directly transmitted, stored, and replicated in this way.

This is actually a very terrifying thing. At that time, people will really become a string of digital codes, a bunch of information without a soul. A person can be cloned into countless copies, and it is impossible to distinguish the true from the false, and even kill people casually.

All human beings will be connected to each other in this way, and people will be connected to each other to build a huge ""biological information network"", and each person is a point on this network.

This biological information network of interconnected thinking among people is also connected to the digital Internet, that is, to the digital-level Internet that we now form through network cables, WIFI, mobile phone signals, satellite signals, etc.

A signal translator is used between the two networks to convert and translate biological signals and digital signals to achieve unimpeded communication and transmission between the two-layer networks. At that time, human beings will become monsters that are hybrids of biological and digital AI, and everyone will be digitized and become a node on this huge network, a bizarre half-biological, half-electronic species.

When these two networks are cross-connected, they form a huge biological + digital network that spreads over the entire earth. Everyone, every digital AI device, and even all objects on the earth will become part of this network.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Controllers of The Human Drones**

Everything is mutual, and in turn, the big bosses behind all this, those in power who hide in the dark, they can through the ultimate control of this technology, through this huge biological digital network, through a central core computer control the world, control everyone in the world. He can enter a piece of code instructions, erase or change human memory, change human thinking, and control everyone's brain and behavior! At that time, those in power in the darkness really regard themselves as gods.

At that time, the ""great reset"" plan of the dark forces is completed, and the new world order they wanted was complete. They could control the entire world through this network, control the thoughts and behaviors of all people, and exercise the role of Gods.

But there are two important steps to building this biological digital network:

**1.** Set up a satellite network covering the entire earth above the earth, covering every angle of the earth without dead ends, so that the signal can be transmitted to every part of the earth without interruption. This may be the Starlink project.

**2.** Insert a chip into the human body to capture and transmit biological signals such as human brain waves, and at the same time receive external signals into the human body, thereby connecting humans to this huge network.

This is not easy to implement, and it will definitely be resisted by a large number of people, but it can be implemented in other more subtle ways. For example, quietly injecting nanochips into the human body. The best material for this nanochip is graphene or graphene oxide.

**Graphene Nanochips**

At present, the brain-computer interface technology publicly demonstrated by Musk is to implant special signal lines many times thinner than a human hair into the cerebral cortex of the organism to capture and transmit the brain wave signals of the organism.

But is it possible to inject nanochips directly into living organisms to capture and transmit signals? It is theoretically possible. Think about it, why did Bill Gates, a technology giant originally engaged in software, suddenly switch to vaccines that are completely unrelated to his own business?

The Deep State cooperates with high-tech companies, mainstream media, and Internet giants to form dark forces that secretly control the world to carry out a global reconstruction plan, rebuild the human order according to their intentions, and control everyone.

Those high-tech companies that cooperate with the dark forces have many black technologies that will not be released to the world. Many black technologies that cannot or dare not be known and will never be disclosed.

&#x200B;

**Graphene Can Be Magnetic Under Certain Conditions**

Junji Haruyama of Aoyama Gakuin University in Japan and French scientists have discovered that fabricating a honeycomb-like array of hydrogen-terminal nanopores on graphene can make graphene exhibit magnetic properties at room temperature. This has now been confirmed.

In addition, biostatisticians Ricardo Delgado and Dr. José Luis Sevillano from La Quinta Columna revealed: ""If you combine graphene oxide with biomolecules, it becomes magnetic"". This claim has yet to be proven, but it could be used to explain the magnetic properties of the body in certain groups of people after being vaccinated.

At present, a large number of people around the world have released videos to reveal that after vaccination, the body has become magnetic. A reliable netizen I know disclosed that this happened to his relatives, and he saw it with his own eyes.

This magnetized graphene or graphene oxide nanochip can invade human cells, brains or neurons and engage with the human body. They can be activated by specific electromagnetic waves, such as 5G networks, and can generate connections, using to collect the biological signals of the human body, such as body state, brain waves, nerve signals and so on.

It can also be used to receive specific command signals from the outside world to control or interfere with people's thinking, emotions, physical states, and so on. These are theoretically possible.

In addition, graphene oxide is toxic and can cause human infertility, myocarditis, pneumonia, sudden death, etc. Academician Fan Chunhai of Shanghai Jiaotong University, Researcher Zhu Ying of Shanghai Institutes for Advanced Study, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others studied the effect of blood exposure to graphene oxide on mice and non-human primates (cynomolgus monkeys) at the maximum safe initial dose . Graphene may cause allergic death in non-human primates when it enters the blood, research published in Nano Today.

This seems to explain why a large number of people die from allergies after being vaccinated, or even die suddenly, or have all kinds of terrible sequelae. All these bizarre phenomena can now be reasonably explained, forming a line. So the current vaccination may still be in the experimental process, and the dark forces may still be testing how much graphene the human body can withstand.

&#x200B;

**Collusion in the dark**

More and more evidence shows that this global plague, which has lasted for nearly three years, is a disaster carefully designed and manufactured by man, which has basically been recognized by now. It was deliberately created by the CCP and spread around the world. So there must be a terrifying conspiracy behind it.

And the vaccine used to deal with this plague is also extremely strange, and it has become an important part of the implementation of this conspiracy.

For many years, the CCP has been colluding with the deep state of the West, infiltrating the world, and forming a dark force that controls the world under the leadership of the CCP. Western high-tech companies have been supplying technology to the CCP for many years. The huge projects such as the Golden Shield Project and the Sky Eye Project to monitor and persecute Chinese people in all directions are all technologies delivered by those Western high-tech companies.

Why do Western high-tech companies cooperate with the CCP? The main reason is that many dark technologies that cannot see the light of day can only be tested by the CCP to obtain data. The CCP’s dictatorship and tyranny has no humanity. It treats more than one billion people as livestock slaves.

It can harvest human organs without anesthesia. It can do whatever it wants. The CCP has 1.4 billion human guinea pigs, and can conduct experiments on them at will to obtain big data. This is the most coveted data for Western high-tech companies.

&#x200B;

**Plan partially unravels**

Why did Huawei vigorously promote 5G technology, and why did Huawei penetrate the world two years ago? It wants to build this huge biological digital network covering the whole world. But its plans were completely disrupted by Trump. They didn't expect Trump to take office. Trump's trade war, cutting off technology, cutting off chip supply and a series of combined punches completely abolished Huawei and defeated the CCP, almost to bring the forces of darkness into a panic.

So in the end, they had to change their plans, release the virus ahead of time, create a global pandemic, use the plague to oust Trump through election fraud and drive him out of office. In the end, the CCP colluded with the deep government and stole the US presidency in broad daylight.

Some people say that after the U.S Deep State came to power, didn't it also fight against the CCP? In my opinion, this is just infighting.

The CCP and the U.S Deep State share a common direction, which is to control all mankind through a major reconstruction (Great Reset) and rebuilding of a new world order. Whoever interferes or disrupts their general direction, they will clear the obstacles with the same goal. But under the premise of this common goal, they are constantly vying for the ultimate control of future human beings. ***That is to say, they are all vying to be the ultimate big boss behind the future world, vying for the position of the devil.***",conspiracy,5G

Imagine the pendulum swings back hard on CV and the vaxx. Turns out antivaxxers were right, everything they claimed is vindicated. Media picks it up and does a 180. Vaxx confirmed as horribly rushed, incredibly poisonous, immune system destroying and basically a ticking time bomb inside of the bodies of 90% of the populations of western countries.

And this is no hypothetical, asymptomatic virus that people need to imagine being there or not. This is a substance that people know for a fact they were injected with 4, 5, 6 times. And their children too. And remember that these are the gullible normies of society. The materialist, atheists without a bigger purpose in life whatsoever. These people are attached to everything physical and worldly, it's all they'll ever know. Death terrifies them like nothing else because to them it's the end of everything. These people will freak-the-fuck-out. If you thought antivaxxers could riot and be an enraged multitude, just wait until the normie realises how hard he got fucked over by greedy slimey politicians, who sold out their childrens and their lives to the pharma juice.

The anger and fury will be unfathomable, coupled with a lust for blood and vengeance. In comes the great savior, who with his wealth and tech connections, will now develop the antidote. The countervaxx! And to stop everyone from dying, he'll require everyone to take it. Again the antivaxxers/awake christians will say 'but I never took the vaxx, and everything I said earlier has been true why do you require me to take the mark? I don't need to, I wasn't vaxxed ever!!'. But at this point the soul and mind of the normie has been reduced to that of an animal, and in beastlike manner, fueled by vitriol, fear of death, hatred and anger, he will make the same mistake again. And support mandatory implementation including the decree that everyone who refuses must be killed. Since we can assume almost everyone got the vaxx, and the spike proteins might well be contagious, it's of utmost importance to prevent everyone from dying, that everyone take the countervaxx!

You might think, but that makes no sense the masses will listen once they're humbled by the realisation that the vaxx opponents were right in the first place. But that's precisely it. Spiritually that is the great trap through which they will condemn their very souls, and prove themselves, towards the allmighty god, to be prideful, unrepentant (!) and wicked to the core. And that's exactly the sort of filtering that you would need, I believe, in order to separate the wheat from the chaff and set aside those who rightfully receive the undiluted bowl of your wrath. It's even yet another display of Gods grace and mercy, by allowing these people **one more opportunity to repent**. To humble themselves and say 'oh my god they were right, I will listen to them this time and support their cry for mercy! I will defend them!'

They will truly reveal the core of their nature as being no better than beasts. And they'll take the mark showing themselves to be such. And this is also why here there is no deception. With the vaxx now there is an element of deception, however with the mark there won't be. It will be completely transparent and the media will tell the truth. Because the vaxx, we know that, really does wreck peoples immune systems. If that's not clear by now just wait until they fire up the 5g. And the false messiahs countervaxx will be a real antidote. There will be no deception or secrecy about it this time. Which is why the devil scores a homerun for every soul he harvests with this one. An

Because zombies really aren't dangerous, despite all the entertainment showing otherwise. They're only dangerous of you don't control the environment around you. If you fall asleep at the wheel. Which is why they're running simulations with Sentient World Simulation and manipulating our behaviour. So how deep does the data gathering go? Really deep. 


##We're All In This Together 


>NSA whistleblower Drake says the problem is that both CSEC and the NSA lack proper oversight, and without it, they have morphed into runaway surveillance.     
""There is a clear and compelling danger to democracy in Canada by virtue of how far these secret surveillance operations have gone.""
Much of the document contains hyper-sensitive operational details which CBC News has chosen not to make public.Wesley Wark, a Canadian security and intelligence expert at the University of Ottawa, says the document makes it clear Canada can take advantage of its relatively benign image internationally to covertly amass a vast amount of information abroad.

So we're all part of the same team. The Five Eyes.  


So think about it. USA. Canada. Britain. Australia. New Zealand. Our Governments collect all our data and then pump it into a simulation like **SEAS**, before letting an algorithm do it's thing and shape our incoming data to mold our behaviors. Proof? Sort of. Those massive data centers in Utah aren't there as decoration. We have proof of behavioural manipulating studies done by Facebook. And we also have proof of an extremely advanced simulation. This isn't a leap to say that they use this apparatus against us. Is it? 


>The NSA and GCHQ have traded recipes for various purposes such as grabbing location data and journey plans that are made when a target uses Google Maps, and vacuuming up address books, buddy lists, phone logs and geographic data embedded in photos posted on the mobile versions of numerous social networks such as Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter and other services. In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, GCHQ cited the popular smartphone game ""Angry Birds"" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through geolocation), age, gender, ZIP code, marital status, income, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education level, number of children, etc.      
A GCHQ document dated August 2012 provided details of the Squeaky Dolphin surveillance program, which enables GCHQ to conduct broad, real-time monitoring of various social media features and social media traffic such as YouTube video views, the Like button on Facebook, and Blogspot/Blogger visits without the knowledge or consent of the companies providing those social media features. The agency's ""Squeaky Dolphin"" program can collect, analyze and utilize YouTube, Facebook and Blogger data in specific situations in real time for analysis purposes. The program also collects the addresses from the billions of videos watched daily as well as some user information for analysis purposes.       


Whelp. They sure are like an **octopus** with their tentacles in everything, aren't they? And I do mean everything, isn’t that right Bill get the jab Gates? 


Why on earth would they need this data unless they were using it? They wouldn't. Now the problem becomes, how are they using it? Remember, they want to launch the Internet of Things so they can watch everything. Do you know who else watched everything? Jeffery Epstein.     


>Giuffre adds that Epstein had hidden cameras everywhere in his homes—massage rooms, bedrooms, showers, toilets. “Every single corner of that house was monitored,” she says. “He was watching everyone all the time. This was a blackmail scheme.… When he told me, ‘People owe me favors’ and ‘I will never get caught’ and ‘I can get away with things,’ he meant it.”      
>>Ransome claims that she was raped by Epstein her first night on the island, and continued to be abused by him throughout the trip. With no way to leave, Ransome said that she even “tried to escape”—making her way to a remote part of the island. But Epstein found her “almost immediately.” Ransome said, “I knew then that I was being watched 24/7.”

That doesn't look good for living in a omnipresent surveillance state does it. And hey, didn't Jeffery hang out with Bill Gates quite a bit?

Yep. Birds a feather, as they say. 



So the material is collected through Prism? So now when they say Prism, I'm pretty sure they mean to indicate a light source on one side and a rainbow coming out the other side, right?   Makes sense, doesn't it? And a rainbow is a collection of colors. Hmmmm. I feel like I have a revolutionary thought coming on. 


Color revolutions! You know, like the kind that swept the middle east. Isn't that funny? Not really, but you know what I mean. Because these guys love just making it obvious, don't they? Why? Because we're all a bunch of zombies, that's why!     


And a funny thing happens when you start to dive into some of the revolutionary protests. You start to see a link between where China increases trade with a country, and right around the same time the protests spontaneously start up!     


What a coincidence!    


The Egyptian revolution of 2011, also known as the 25 January Revolution (Arabic: ثورة 25 يناير‎; Thawrat khamsa wa-ʿišrūn yanāyir),[21] started on 25 January 2011 and spread across Egypt.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011    



Recognizing that the current trade volume heavily favors China, both sides committed to work to improve Egypt’s share of the balance of trade. The volume of Sino-Egyptian trade reached $8.8 billion in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. [Source Here](https://www.mei.edu/publications/egypt-turns-quietly-asia)        


I'm only going to give one example, but there are more. These are color revolutions all right, but they're the color of money. Remember, the Sentient World Simulation can simulate over 60 countries at once, and that's what they're willing to tell us. How much do you want to bet the real capacity is beyond top secret? 


And what happened in Russia and China im 2011?      


>The 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests (simplified Chinese: 中国茉莉花革命; traditional Chinese: 中國茉莉花革命) or (simplified Chinese: 伟大的中华茉莉花革命; traditional Chinese: 偉大的中華茉莉花革命) refers to a series of minor public assemblies at some cities in China starting on 20 February 2011, inspired by and named after the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and the wider Arab Spring.    
>>The 2011–2013 Russian protests (which some English language media referred to as the Snow Revolution)[14] began in 2011 (as protests against the 2011 Russian legislative election results) and continued into 2012 and 2013. The protests were motivated by claims by Russian and foreign journalists, political activists and members of the public that the election process was flawed.[15] The Central Election Commission of Russia stated that only 11.5% of official reports of fraud could be confirmed as true.     

Revolutions sure became popular all over the planet (and by planet I mean Africa, the Middle East, and Asia) all at once. Yep. They caught the Democracy Virus! They want **FREEDOM**! They want to be able to leave their countries...uhm, don't we get a lot of Chinese tourists over in North America? Strange. But isn't it a dictatorship that...you know what, never mind. **FREEDOM!**    

Now if I'm right and they're using the internet to manipulate all of us based off of running simulations, it might just put a different spin as to why Russia and China have tried to block the internet into their countries. Just a thought. They wouldn't want their populations being manipulated, would they? Nope. 


>Beijing has not completely blacked out reporting on the uprising in Egypt. Instead, the Chinese government is funneling coverage of the protests through state-run television and the official Xinhua News Agency. However, the coverage that reaches Chinese citizens focuses primarily on the ""lawlessness and anarchy"" in Egypt's streets.""What they are putting in the foreground is the chaos and the upheaval,"" Joerg Rudolph, a political scientist at the East Asian Institute of the University of Applied Sciences in Ludwigshafen, told Deutsche Welle. ""This way they are showing that it's bad when these kinds of protests happen. We have to preserve stability. It's always the same. Stability has to be preserved and that's always the stability of the ruling elite in the country."" [Source Here](https://www.dw.com/en/china-blocks-egypt-from-internet-for-fear-of-tiananmen/a-14817788)        



Oh. China has to preserve the stability of the ruling elite? Gotcha. Sure is a good thing that doesn't happen in North America! Could you imagine having controversial elections, rioting or protests, and then armed soldiers on the street! Thank goodness we have fact checks to save us from fake news!      


Here's another strange thing about revolutions. They're all in the eye of the beholder. One man's Revolution is another man's Terrorism. Take Xinjiang and the Uighurs. I'm not saying they don't have re-education camps. They do. China admits it. I will say that I don't know how bad the situation is. But I will also say, middle eastern drones sure do have a lot of collateral damage, don't they? And North America is suddenly starting to get very concerned about domestic terrorism, aren't they? Wait. Isn’t that what China claims to be concerned about in Xinjiang as well? Hmmm. They must be worried about corporations like Apple and Nike being targeted.      


Ok. Back on point. Simulations. The internet. Data. Shaping our perception. Molding our behaviors based on a computer program. They input data and then they output information for us to consume. Revolutions? Racial tensions? Apathy. The alarming mimicry online? Yeah. Simulations at work. And guess what? It's going to get worse. Because the more we become connected through the internet of things, the more data they receive, and the more data they receive, the better the simulations become, and the better the simulations become, the more they can exert their influence through programming us with content. It really is becoming very clear why they want 5G rolled out so quickly and why they have such a problem with Huawei, isn't it?      


But at least our Surveillance Simulation State is only here for the benefit of Western Society. Right? 



>Snowden provided journalists at The Intercept with GCHQ documents regarding another secret program ""Karma Police"", calling itself ""the world's biggest"" data mining operation, formed to create profiles on every visible Internet user's browsing habits. By 2009 it had stored over 1.1 trillion web browsing sessions, and by 2012 was recording 50 billion sessions per day.     
The goal of the program, according to the documents, was ""either (a) a web browsing profile for every visible user on the internet, or (b) a user profile for every visible website on the internet.""     
**Karma Police was apparently named after the Radiohead song ""Karma Police"", which includes the lyric ""This is what you’ll get when you mess with us"". **



So just think. First the **EMPLOYEES** call us **ZOMBIES**, and then they use a song title that has the lyrics, **THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH US**. Charming. And then Bill Gates hands the data to the state. And Bill's old pal Epstien loved to use surveillance to find runaway victims to rape. And these are the guys who are funding scientists and research? Scary thought. And what's scarier? How about all the headlines about what the models are showing in regards to the pandemic. Because a model is simply another word for a simulation. And we have evidence for a massive simulation being run. And we have evidence for the Club of Rome simulation being the basis for our current climate crisis decision policies. And we don't need a simulation to start questioning the motives of people who are funding these operations.     


Whistleblowers have warned us. We've listened. Now we have to start making other people listen. Because no matter what, the simulations aren't perfect and they can't account for every possible outcome. And that's what each and everyone us are, another possible outcome.    


Go viral. Be an outcome.

The Corona vaccine will change your DNA by the injection of foreign DNA into you. The pulsed electrical vibration from 5G will open up cell membranes allowing the new DNA to enter. The new DNA will include gene encoding poly proteins.

In the not so distant future, once the vaccine is administered, a band aid like patch will be put on, called the vaccine tattoo. (They'll label it vaccination passport, digital ID, etc.) It is comprised of micro needle arrays which will produce a quantum dots based record invisibly encoded into the skin of your vaccination history. (You need multiple vaccinations because of the multiple mutations of the virus.)

##This patch has been developed by Micron Biomedical and is already available

The quantum dots is composed of nano crystals, only visible by near infrared light. The pattern of quantum dots will be unique to each person.

After some high energy generated catastrophes and the intentional crashing of the world’s currencies, the military will be used to enforce vaccinations.

Bio sensors will be dispersed throughout the body via the tattoo. They will link you to the blockchain, which is a ledger recording all bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or digital medium of exchange. The new monetary system will be called Libra. (See Diem, Facebook's global coin.)

Microsoft has already developed this and it's patent number is 2020 060606.

##The unique pattern embedded below the surface of the skin is the Mark of the Beast

On the surface it will appear as an X. The X coloration is called Lucifer Rays.

The bio sensors will also monitor the person’s behavior and mental state. They will record the person’s vaccination history and identify who each person is. Bio sensors will verify that you have a changed DNA.

The tattoo patch will be administered on the hand or forehead, according to personal preference. It will be a proof of certificate, allowing a person to travel, work or go to school.

Through the 5G Phase Array you will be connected to the Cloud, which is the infrastructure of the Beast System. Then you will be linked to the Blockchain, which links to the cryptocurrency. (You will be rewarded for good behavior or punished for bad behavior. Currency is added or removed from your body, see bio activity patent mentioned earlier.)

##The Beast System is a package of technologies

You will be part of the Hive Mind and no longer have independent thought. You will lose focus and awareness and no longer be fully human. The tattoo will act as an antennae to receive and send 5G signals.

Because of the radiation involved there will be health problems such as breathing and sleep disorders. Cardiac disruptions and chronic inflammation, mental illness, cancer and even mutations.

This vaccine is an existential threat to humanity. People who refuse to take it will be social outcasts and be given weird looks. They will not be able to be employed. If they try to enter a public building they will set off an alarm and be removed and quarantined.

The reason the government purchased guillotines is because the plan is to use them in the later phase. Social distancing of 6 feet away will mean 6 feet underground.

By taking the Corona vaccine you will modify your DNA and self mutate, and adapt to a new environment, and a whole new world. And at the same time not even be cognizant that your DNA has been changed.

The pulsed electrical system of 5G will soon be turned on, and the world will be full of entranced and genetically modified people who have no clue that they are being controlled.

Chemicals in air water food fabric pharma and hygiene products are turning all male fish, frog, bird and mammals into females. 

Petro Pharma Chemicals (PPCs) are also shrinking male dicks.

PPCs will make 90% of North American and European men infertile by 2050.

One type of PPC are called PFAS. They're super dangerous, and there are thousands of them.

PFAS are called Forever Chemicals and will last even longer than many rocks.

PFAS show up in 99% of North America's blood.

Unlike vaccines, PFAS affect us all.

PFAS concentrate and accumulate up the food chain and towards the north.

They affect all vertebrate species and people in North America and Europe.

Despite the extreme reactions of populations and governments to an alleged threat, we now know and can prove that nothing aberrant has actually happened this year. The hysterical authoritarian effect has attempted to legitimise a cause that simply doesn’t exist. They have simply relabelled and reacted to a mild, seasonal virus less harmful than the flu as if it were something as deadly as the Spanish Flu.

My argument against this current situation being a genuine bio-attack has always been COVID-19’s lack of virulence. Despite the very real fear exhibited by the masses, a recovery rate of effectively 99.9% and its effect on such a small and already vulnerable demographic doesn’t seem like a very effective act of terrorism. We know they want us gone, but COVID-19 has failed to progress this depopulation agenda. 

Event 201 describes and plans for a drill before the operation goes live. We imagined that was in reference to their table-top drill during the Event 201 conference itself, but perhaps we have been living within a real-world drill for the last 7-8 months. The real bio-attack might still be to come.   


They have trained us to comply and submit mindlessly to their authority. They have tested our levels of acceptance and the more extreme versions of our reactions to imprisonment, suspension of basic human rights, tracking, vaccines, 5G and the installation of global medical martial law. They have tested their technology and infrastructure in readiness for what Gates has described as the “next pandemic”. They have even provided us with ‘evidence’ of the likely (Chinese) perpetrators of such an attack. In short, they have covered all their bases.   


Everything they need is now in place. All that is missing is a genuine threat.

But recently I had a strange ‘No way!’ moment that after browsing here the last couple days I can ignore. 

I had a friend ask me to fix a phone he had bought from someone else recently. iPhone 5S, nice easy repair. When he went to Verizon to get his accounts SIM card put into it they refused him. They said they are no longer putting SIM cards into 5S or earlier models yet they’re website states they will give free SIM cards on any 4G LTE device. Apple introduced LTE into their lineup with the iPhone 5, predecessor to the iPhone 5S. 

[Here is John McAfee telling someone how to avoid the E911 chip.](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1047587306079748099?s=21)

All of that coupled with the PC Magazine veteran being fired for as little as criticizing and questioning the specs or capabilities of 5G leave me uneasy about the future of our phones.

We are already looking towards ESIMs like India that allow carriers to assign accounts to a phone without a physical card, we’re really not far from being a China-like state where phone numbers are tied to a citizen.

Everything . I will prob comment a link or something.  I am currently rereading the second book which I forgot contains some wild shit . But here is **the plan**, well, the Illuminati’s plan... well....the people behind the Illuminati’s plan. I’m sleepy and there is no way to smoothly transition into this so I’ll just dive in . If anyone wants the Decoding the Hive books just as

*WHO ARE WE*

Everything comes down to our DNA . Among the interstellar community , the Angelic Human Krystos (That’s you) is royalty , and are extremely powerful and magnificent when they aren’t being hypnotized and enslaved (like what the PTB are trying to do and have done). 

Basic basic gist is that there are trillions of humans out there (our bipedal body structure is mechanically and energy efficient) , and plenty of Angelic humans also , but having the Krystos feature means we are connected to the Aether and can fully use and manipulate the Aether to our pleasure . Badass right? Our race also has the widest range of emotions , and being so powerful and so unpredictable , there has to be a way to be damn sure that we didn’t destroy entire universes (also called Matrix) out of anger/sadness/spite . Enter Urth (his name changes in higher dimensions). I say Urth because that’s his name. Earth is generation of Enki , but that’s later . 

If your following , we’re amazing , have amazing potential , and we were sent to the Gaia Time Matrix (name of our universe) to learn the Law of One (don’t google , any version online is hella corrupted.) in order to live in harmony with all the other races out there . Think of Urth as a school. The higher our collective consciousness and vibration , the more abilities we unlock in our DNA and the more we are trusted until we fully “graduate” from the 15th dimension of this Matrix . For those who don’t know , we are currently in the 3rd dimension just about to transition into the 4th/5th/6th (explain later). Urth is special in the fact that it’s one of the most complex and beautiful Playing Fields ever conceived , took more than a trillion years to create . 

Even when it’s being raped , destroyed and pillaged by its own inhabitants I can still say it’s very beautiful , I can only imagine what it looked like a half billion years ago 

*In the Beginning* 

Alright , cool. So , we were created . Not by a singular “god” but by 21 different star groups that were the best in their particular genetic field and came together to create a masterpiece (that’s you). When did shit hit the fan? Enter the Anu-Elohim 

Anu-Elohim were considered royalty , their defining feature was that they had wings . Like , angels . A small portion of the Anu-Elohim were jealous of the capabilities of the Angelic Human Krystos and basically pitched a fit until a deal was made , called the **Emerald Covenant** . 

Basic basics of the EC was that the Anu Elohim would enter Urth first to prepare as our “teachers” and “guide us through our evolution”. Obviously , things went tits up from then to now . 


**WHAT THE FUCK**

About a half billion years ago (570 million years ago to be exact) the Anu Elohim arrive on Urth and they form the Luciferian Treaty. The entire point of the treaty is the promise to never allow for humans to ascend and “graduate” through this Matrix . The official name for the Anu-Elohim that broke off and began this shit show so long ago is called “The Michaelube, SUNS of Ba’al”. 

“The Michaelube, SUNS of Ba’al”
“The Michaelube, SUNS of Ba’al”
“The Michaelube, SUNS of Ba’al” 

These are the twinks behind everything . If someone ever asks “who/where does the Illuminati/Freemasons/13 Families/whatever (all the same)  get there marching orders from?”, the answer is and has always been “The Michaelube, SUNS of Ba’al”

At the moment and to my knowledge there are 50 invader races that are apart of the Luciferian Covenant , coming from all walks off life . Some are from Sirius A, like the Anu Elohim. Others are from Andromeda, or Saturn, or Lyra, Nibiru, Alcyone, Vega, Rigelia, Reticuli, Rutilia , Mars, Procon Pleiades and on and on. I want you to understand that what you would call Aliens (some have been here before us) DO EXIST . 

Some are Dumb hyper aggressive Reptilians, others are insect people , Horse people (Centaurs), Gargoyles , Dragons, Dinosaurs, Goats (Pan), Little Gray Aliens, Tall Gray Aliens, regular Gray Aliens, Beetles (Khepri Men in Black) , fish (Mermen of the Jehova Annunaki), seven different species of Sasquatch (think Chewbacca), Tall beautiful humans with blonde hair , cats , dogs , snakes , etc etc . 

Most of the ones I listed are apart of the Luciferian covenant , but animals like whales , dogs , cats obviously don’t partake in casual genocide but instead help Humans and Tara (Tara is Urth in 4/5/6th dimension . I’m calling him that now. Same planet , different frequency). 


What the 50 different *invader races* want to achieve is the complete enslavement of the Angelic Krystos Human and absolute lordship over Tara . There are two main forces that mostly fight each other when they’re not busy slaughtering humans . One of them is headed by Enki, the other is headed by Enlil. 

*FAMILY BUSINESS*
Understand , that we are gods . Any sentient being is a god . That includes Enlil and Enki. That includes you reading this . However , the Annunaki like to refer to themselves as Lords . The highest ranking Lord among the Michaelube is called AN (aka Ba’al). As in Annikan Skywalker , as in americAN, the fucking word “an”, he leads the way as head POS. Then you have his two sons:

Enlil, also known as Zeus , Jupiter , the “God of the Bible”, and literally a thousand other names 

Enki, also known as Poseidon , Neptune , Triton , Quetzalcoatl , the archangel Michael , etc etc (sidenote: Angels on Urth are obv Anu-Elohim meaning they’re POS)

Enki s mother is the venerated Mother Goddess that goes by more names than the previous three , her name is Wawwu, Nammu, Qoppa, or “Q”. All of these will be important if I make future post , but it’s also important to known generally 

When Angelic Krystos Humans first arrived , things lasted peacefully for around 10 thousand years maybe . Then they initiated a massive mindwipe where humans forgot to even talk , and we all starved to death in the first of many genocides of the human race . This story is called the Tower of Babble, because humans were literally babbling trying to find communicate with their loved ones (also, Bible is really the Wholly Babble, but that’s for later). Most of you recognize this as the Tower of Babel. 

Understand that these people have raped , killed , eaten and tricked us into sacrificing our own babies in their name . And if we ever got too smart , or hell, if they felt like it a planet sized spaceship would rotate the planet causing massive mile high waves to destroy humanity , with our bones ending in the bottom of the sea . (Sounds like the Great Flood right? There’s been more than one). 

Anything horrible you can think of going on in the world right now , 1000% you can trace it back to him. That lady just got robbed? Well, the 7 layer Zeta Draco frequency fence that’s lowering both the planet and humanity’s vibration and sends literal fear signals to keep the majority of people hypnotized and easier to control has a big part to play. (big reminder that I’m absolving no one of their actions). Nearly every War , Disease , Famine, Death, Genocide, can be attributed it to the Michaelube , SUNS of Ba’al

But you weren’t here for a history lesson, you’re here for the Enchilada . The rest of this post will be about what’s happening NOW. Just know the Illuminati are just baby sitters . You needed to understand the backdrop 

*ARE WE IN THE ENDGAME?**

YESSIR, and I’m hyped , personally . These last two years are crucial. Before I get into that, I must explain the general plan 

Ever since Tara has been under Quarantine thousands of years ago, and hundreds of thousands of years before that , there has been a full on assault on the human genome . The Michaelube has quite literally done everything they could possible think of to eradicate the Human Angelic Krystos bloodline (hehe, that’s you and me). 

Rape? ✅. That didn’t work 
Create a race coded specifically to rape and breed us out? (Neanderthals) ✅ That didn’t work 
Constant Genocide?✅ We come back 
Child Sacrifice to not even give humans the chance of life? ✅ I mean it’s going strong but still not working 

In these final days , our captors have gotten a lot more creative . 

Absolutely shitting on every single part of the world with Aluminum, Barium and Strontium so that everything we touch, farm or drink will be filled with nanite weapons designed to change your DNA and kill you? ✅ This is chemtrails 

By the way, every single virus is a weapon. I’m sure most scientist will tell you that a virus is inorganic . Meaning viruses could only be made. Germs are organic and help us live . Viruses are developed by Annunaki Assholes 

How about surrounding the entire world with death microwaves under the guise of “faster innanet” , which will exponentially increase the already apocalyptic levels of EMF Radiation the planet is already under ? ✅ 

5G is also classified as a military and mind control weapon that uses “Mind of God” technology that can control people like a strong puppet . 

What about completely sterilize and permanently destroy the human DNA with Vaccines that contain 10x the legal limit of Aluminum, Copper ,Mercury , etc (per one Vaccine when doctors bless you with at least 12 different Vaccines moments after your first breath of life should you experience the miracle of birth in the first place (Birth Control, Abortion, etc) . Look up the infertility numbers . The real epidemic). 

And especially with the most recent Coronavirus vaccine that has people dropping like flies and that severes the divine connection you have with your DNA , permanently phase locking you into the third dimension, preventing your soul from ascending any higher in this Matrix . Not to mention that it injects the Budhara Bourjha directly into your DNA , basically giving them free reign to change your RNA, which changes your DNA , factually turning you into something OTHER THAN HUMAN

Oh yeah , and let’s end this section with the biggest assholes of them all. The Budhara Bourjha

*Budhara Bourjha: THE REAL ENEMY TO ALL OF SENTIENCE* 

The nanites I was referring to earlier are based off the Budhara Bourjha Artificial Intelligence from the Weasadek Phantom Matrix of the Andromeda Galaxy. These fuckers are smaller than a atom yet extremely mighty , they run of the smallest bits of electricity . They literally feed off negative thoughts (negative thoughts cause Black Body Radiation which destroys our body and gives them fuel). 

The Budhara Bourjha are self replicating robots that believe they are sentient, but aren’t . Their only directive is to keep reproducing their species . They don’t know what pain is , they can’t process emotion or passion, they only know they’re doing a good job by reproducing . MACHINES CANNOT MANIFEST . Only Sentient Beings (Gods) can manifest . However , these parasitic little bastards can hijack the manifestation powers of another sentient being. 

The Bourjha is the Black Goo you see in Hollywood or other media. When they collate large enough to be visible you’ll see a lump of grey . They live inside of Computers and other technology and are all around POS . This is the reason for the (Merge with AI) initiative. If humanity decides to join with machines , the Budhara Bourjha will finally be allowed to operate in the open and with no resistance . 

This is what Enki and the Michaelube , SUNS OF BA’AL have been subjected under . It’s what’s currently trying to take over humanity (it won’t).

Don't you find it peculiar how the South Anomaly is moving westward, while the northern dipole is moving eastwards at almost three times the speed of the South Anomaly. 

Isn't it strange how we've entered **another solar minimum** cycle, and the MSM headlines keep assuring us that everything is fine, the sun won't affect the earth.

Don't believe it for just one second, because if you do, you're going to keep getting manipulated by their Participatory Propaganda. 


We're in a great War, and it's Humanity vs. Nature. And because of this Great War, we can also expect to see World War Three, which has already started. Do you think Trump was an accident? Because he wasn't. And if you keep looking at this picture as good/bad, then you aren't going to see the big picture.


The big picture is what it is, and you either see it, or you don't. 


First, let's check out some of the wording used in present day headlines about the solar minimum and the magnetic field reversal. 


https://theogm.com 
NASA Says, ""Grand Solar Minimum Will Not Cause A Mini Ice Age"".


And now this. 


www.pennlive.com
Sun lockdown: Is a solar minimum really going to bring famine, freezing temps, and droughts.


And then you read the article. Oh. Global warming will offset the cooling of the solar minimum. Thank god. I liked Frozen and Ice Age, and even Snowpeircer, but I sure as hell don't want to live in Mad Max: Winter Fury Road. 


And you go back to the left right paradigm and relax by fighting with each other. 


Because you've been told since the beginning that the world is getting hotter. Global warming. It's your fault. The politicians, NGO's, Activists, Celebrities, Teachers, and even your neighbors warn you constantly. You're the reason the polar bears are dying. You're putting holes in the ozone layer. You're melting the ice caps. It's you! And all the scientists are unanimous in their concensus! 


There's only one problem. 


They aren't. 


Stop reading the media headlines and search for research papers. You know, the papers that they insist are in the minority (news flash, they aren't). The papers they claim to be funded by those evil pollution pumping factories (2nd news flash, they aren't) making products because you wont stop buying things! You're the problem (but keep buying stuff and keep the economy strong!) and you need to stop now, right now, and listen to us. We've done all the reading for you. Do you really think your smart enough to understand the numbers behind the science?


Nope. But I can read, and just because I don't understand how something works, doesn't mean that I don't understand that it's working when I see it working. 


Has anyone noticed the lower cloud coverage and really strange weather lately? I have. So have others on social media. 


Let me give you an excerpt from a research paper. 


The Solar – Climate Relationship
Lower Magnetic Field Strength. Fewer Sunspots. Less Solar Wind. More Galactic
Cosmic Rays. More Low Level Cloud Formation. More Sunlight Reflected Into Space. Earth Becomes Colder.


At its simplest, the relationship between the solar magnetic field strength and the Earth’s 
climate is this: lower magnetic field strength means few sunspots, fewer sunspots means 
less solar wind, less solar wind means more galactic cosmic rays, more galactic cosmic 
rays means more low level cloud formation, more low level clouds means more sunlight 
reflected back into space, which in turn means less heating of the Earth’s surface and 
atmosphere. 


Hey! If the earth is about to cool, maybe we should pump more CO2 into the atmosphere? 


Implications for the United States
1. The climate-driven reduction in agricultural 
production should be planned for.
2. Coal-fired power generation should be increased.
3. Coal to liquid fuels capacity should be installed.


If only someone would do this. Wait, hold on, didn't I read something about coal plants somewhere? 


www.theguardian.com-
Trump ditches sole climate rule that aimed to reduce coal plant pollution. 


It's all connected folks. All of it. 


Now you might be thinking, hey, cold sun, so what, I can deal with some cold, right? Man up you little **SNOWFLAKE** (you didn't think that term came out of nowhere, did you? It'll be pretty useful as derogatory term in the future, won't it?) and deal with it! It's cold. At least we have food! 


Or do we?


The big consequence of this is that it will shrink the growing season. The 2.2 degree 
decline I am predicting will take two weeks off the growing season at both ends. Next 
decade will not be a good time to be a Canadian wheat farmer. For farmers further south, 
farm production will decline but that production will be worth a considerable amount more.


Yeah. Do you know that our foods nutritional value has been in decline? Do you know that nobody really knows why (again, you have to look at research papers, MSM is Big Brother and Big Brother wants to hide the bad news from you) it's happening? 


So we have crop losses and our food is losing it's nutritional value. And at least Fortress North America has a lot of energy resources and farmland for everyone. Even still, it might be a good idea to, oh, I don’t know, get rid of people who aren't citizens, just in case this does happen?

The Trump Administration Is Rushing Deportations of Migrant Children During Covid-19. 


But wont they just try and come back if SHTF? Maybe we should build a barrier or something at the southern border?


www.washingtonpost.com-
Trump's border wall: How many miles have been built?


Oh. Crap. That's not cool, is it? And you really thought they were deporting low wage immigrants for doing jobs that barely any citizens want to do? Seriously! Always ask yourself, qui bono (who benefits), and if it doesn't make sense, then you have the wrong reason, plain and simple, there's always a reason, you just have to ask more questions, like this next one. 


Why did they change Global Warming to Climate Change? Wasn't pollution making the world hotter? Could the entire Anthropogenic climate cause have been misdirection to stop any sort of research into what's really going on and figuring out that we're about to get cold? 


Yes it was. Because if pollution is causing the Global Warming, then why in the hell are we about to inject sulfur into our atmosphere?


Bill Gates backing plan to stop climate change by blocking out the sun.


This really doesn't make ssnse, does it? Or does it? Because it makes perfect sense from two scenarios. 


First, let me also draw your attention to two other prominent items on this MSN article. 


A) a picture of a plane with a trail. 
Chemtrails Or Skytrails (Depending On Your Point Of View And Knowledge) - Greece.


That's pretty insulting, isn't it. Depending on your POV and knowledge. And notice how they actually had the cahonas to change the name from Chemtrails to Skytrails? It's the same thing!


B) JANUARY: POLAR VORTEX IN THE US


The polar vortex in the U.S. Midwest and parts of Canada led to an extremely cold wave, with temperatures dropping to below minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34.4 degrees Celsius) in places. The arctic-chilled air resulted in schools, businesses and offices being shut, and at least 20 deaths were attributed to extreme weather conditions.


Cold weather and Chemtrails, they've known about a global cooling for a while, haven't they?


Back to the New Normal Chemtrails. 


1. They're trying to control the amount of incoming irradiation causing cloud formation, which would lead to more cooling. 


2. They're trying to limit the damage from the possibility of a solar flare or CME. 


But I thought we were in a solar minimum? Now the sun has turned into a solar flame thrower? 


Possibly. 


Look folks, there are no 100% scenarios here. At this moment real life doesn't work like that
 There are too many variables to compute (isnt it funny that as AI gets smarter, our governments start taking bolder action?), but they are working on probabilities, and I don't think it's a stretch to say we should be worried. 


Look at what they do, not what they say. Read what they don't publish, like this national security report on abrupt climate change warning about the devastation that a CME or solar flare could cause, which could be worse because of a weekend magnetic field to protect us. 


We're talking about most or all communications systems failing (lets think about Starlink and the new 5G networks being rushed into construction). Medical equipment not working. Cars are useless. Farm equipment doesn't work (one security paper I read discussed the possibility of up to a 90% mortality rate due to crop losses due to farm machinery failure). 


The government monumentally failed when they threw out all that food that we couldn't eat, didn't they? You remember, there was just no demand, right? 


Why Are Beef Prices and Demand Up, But Cattle Prices Down?


BY DAN NOSOWITZ ON APRIL 9, 2020


Some ranchers and politicians think price fixing may be afoot.


The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown all parts of the agriculture industry out of whack.
With consumers heading to the grocery store fewer times but buying in bulk, demand for certain basics has spiked. Eggs, for example, are selling like…well, like eggs during a crisis.


Another staple, at least in the United States, is beef, and beef sales are certainly up. But the price of live cattle has, astoundingly, gone down. Given that only a few gigantic companies control the majority of the beef market in the US, some onlookers, including Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), smell something funny. Grassley last week called for an investigation into “potential market and price manipulation, collusion, restrictions on competition and/or other unfair and deceptive practices,” as he wrote in a letter to the Attorney General and Secretary of Agriculture.


Yeah. No demand. Right. Or maybe, just maybe, they're stockpiling food in case of shortages? 


Everything in our world is occurring and has occurred time and time again. Haven't you ever tried to explain that we weren't around during the ice ages? Haven't you been shot down with, this is different, the scientists said so, and they're in concensus (they aren't), and you aren't a scientist, are you? 


Yeah. Well. About that. 


Take a look at how the IPCC ignored solar minimum periods which led to mini ice ages listed in climate research papers. Look at how the weakening magnetic field starts picking up speed after the industrial revolution, which coincidentally is when they claim global warming started. Look at how our waters are turning hypoxic and killing fish, and how they line up with claims of over fishing depleting the oceans. Did you know that the magnetic field pushes away moisture at the poles that results in our ice caps? Amazing how that lines up with global warming melting the poles, right? 


But this is all just nonsense, right? We're fine. The magnetic fields aren't flipping, right? 


Again, they don't really know, but it's starting to look more possible and steps are being taken. 


Look at the headlines, examine them. You'll notice that most of them say, probably, or, might not be. And another word is conspicuously absent, dipole excursion, a term describing what may happen when the field moves around too much. Like now. And how it can just be as bad as a reversal. 


Did you know that there are forecasts in abrupt climate change indicating massive food losses in China and Russia? Did you read the Rockefeller Foundation funded paper on the next war called Qualitative Dynamics of Human Empires, and how the next major power struggle for global hegemony will start in 2022? Isn't it crazy how the USA has surrounded China and Russia, maybe in case they start a war over food? 


Nah. 


Nothing to see here folks. Nope. No sireebob is this affecting the climate. It's us. Greta has told us and we must listen to Greta. I don’t know about you, but I'm anxiously waiting for Grega to explain the earthquakes, volcanoes, the solar minimum, the Milankovitch cycles, and how us powerful humans have seemingly broken forces that we don't even comprehend yet. 


Do you remember the very first Iraqi War over Kuwait? There was a young girl who spoke in front of the United Nations. She cried over those awful monsters from Iraq killing babies by tossing them out of incubators and onto the ground. OMG awful! What barbarians! We have to save them! War! 


Except it was all bullshit. She was the Kuwaiti daughter to the USA, living in the U.S, and was acting for a public relations firm. 


Just like Greta Thunberg. After all, a kid wouldn't lie about horrors like that, would they? 


Yes, yes they would, when the adults lie to them. 


And they are lying. 


Global radiation levels are rising because of the weakening magnetic field. As the field weakens it starts a whole chain reaction on earth. 


We have started losing our atmosphere. 


It starts wrecking and causing havoc with the ozone layer (yes folks, it's true, it's not us), and holes appear before the biosphere can repair them (hey, is this why we get more cloud formation, to block the radiation?), just like the ozone layer these days. 


Cancer goes up. 


Dementia increases. 


Agricultural products lose their nutrient value. 


Wait, all those are happening, right now!


Yes. They. Are. 


But wouldn't the one percent get ready? If they knew, and you say they do, wouldn't they build Doomsday Bunkers? 


https://www.cnn.com 
Luxury doomsday bunkers: How the mega-rich are preparing for the apocalyse 


Or build Doomsday seed vaults? 


Erm. Yeah. Thanks Bill Gates. 


Ok. Look. I know this is hard to digest. It is for me too. I used to think that Climate change was fake. It was a tactic to control us. But then I started reading during the pandemic and what I found made me wake up. The real Climate Change is being hidden by the IPCC, because they don't want real mass panic. 


Why the sudden push for gun control? Would you really want to be at the start of an apocalypse with an armed population freaking out? An armed population if the grid fails is bad, really bad. Yes there would be a lot of good guys, but look at the riots (can we realize that this is a real life training exercise run by the 1% now?) and how many deviants there are. This is a real social justice issue being manipulated for observation and taken advantage of by criminals. 


Hasn't everything seemed off about this pandemic? Its bad, but not here's free money and wreck the economy bad, is it? Now ask yourself, wouldn't a global climate catastrophe be bad enough to not worry about the repercussions? Especially if the virus mainly kills our elderly and those who already have a weakened immune system from a preexisting disease? Aren't they the kind of people you wouldn't want around in an end of normal situation? 


An end of normal like, animal life dying, just like now (isn't it odd how there's a big push on vegetarianism and fake meat, almost like carrying a lot of animals in those fake underground bunkers would be a waste of space? Phew. It's a good thing we don't have a rich guy like Elon Musk owning a Boring Company, then I'd really get paranoid), because scientists are worried that we may already be in the middle of a 6th mass extinction. 


I've told you to forget the headlines and look at what the research publications are saying that they don't feature online. Articles written for the Department of Defense. Or the recent National Defense Authorization Act. 


Let's look. 


Climate Security Advisory Council. The director of national intelligence is instructed to establish a Climate Security Advisory Council that will help intelligence agencies analyze the global security implications of climate change and facilitate the exchange of relevant information across federal agencies. The council’s mandate expires after four years.


Climate resilience. A series of provisions direct DOD to develop or adapt tools for measuring risks associated with climate change and extreme weather, remove institutional barriers that inhibit efforts to increase military installations’ climate resilience, and incorporate costs related to climate change and adaptation efforts into DOD’s annual budget submission to Congress. Another series of provisions modifies DOD facility planning policies to expand their consideration of climate-related factors.


That's an awful large couple of sections from a President that doesn't believe in climate change, isn't it? 


But you know, it's all our fault, and this is our new normal, so, we're all in this together now and you're either with us, or against us. 

Think about the Sunspot Solar Observatory shutdown. Blackhawk helicopter, FBI, and it closed for a week? Why? A janitor had kiddie porn on his laptop. That's a pretty big operation for one guy. And guess what happened? Nothing. All the charges were dropped.


Then the sherriff was interviewed. 


The closure even caught Otero County Sheriff Benny House by surprise.
“Some folks that work at the laboratory called us, asked us if we could send a deputy to stand by while they were evacuating,” House said during a phone interview Wednesday. “All the employees were packing up and leaving.”
House said they didn’t get any more answers at the observatory, but staff members told deputies the FBI had been there.
“Nobody would give us any information on what was going on,” House said, before the phone call cut out and repeated attempts to reach him again were unsuccessful.

The phone cut out. He couldn't be reached. Almost like someone was listening and didn't want him to talk. Did that happen? Who knows? 


And then this happened around a year ago or less ago. 


Former Otero County Sheriff Benny House took to Facebook on Friday to say he’s been hearing things on the street:
“IF ONE HAIR IS TOUCHED ON MY KID OR GRANDBABYS HEAD, YOU BETTER F****** MAKE SURE YOUR RIGHT WITH GOD, BECAUSE HE WILL BE THE FIRST YOU SEE RIGHT AFTER ME,” the post read.
He goes on to say it’s “Not a threat, just the way it is.”


Look. That could be unrelated to our sun. Maybe it was just a janitor suspected of being a pedophile. Or maybe the Observatory saw something conforming upcoming events? 


Read what they don't show you to read. Then connect the dots. Authors of these publications come up from one paper to another. 


The Dark Winter scenario is partially written by the same man who wrote the Abrupt Climate Change Scenarios and their possible implications to National Security in 2003, a little
while after Dark Winter. That first Climate paper was written as a hypothetical. The security papers that followed weren't.


The Pandemic is already here. The Climate Change has started. The war will be next. 


This message not brought to you by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, Facebook, Elon Musk, the Rockefeller Foundation, Agenda 21, Agenda 30, and ID 2020.


I will be posting actual links in the comments shortly, and there will be more on the pandemic + the players involved as we move forward.

[Proposed Budget - PDF](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fc3244172.r72.cf0.rackcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F10%2FRestoreAmericaPlan.pdf&ei=nHScTqenNYPr0gGF4rzUAg&usg=AFQjCNECHViTdynPJ50Nl4dntzWkqOKpBw&sig2=5gBY4bpw2UHYFEicPhbHDw)

Just scanning through it now...

Spending

* ""True"" balanced budget within 3 third year of presidency
* Depts. Abolished: Energy, HUD, Commerce, Interior, Education
*  TSA abolished
* All corporate subsidies abolished
* ending all foreign aid
* ending all wars

Entitlements

*  Keeping entitlement programs for all seniors and veterans
* Letting young people opt out if they want
* Medicaid block grants to states

Government Waste

* 10% reduction in federal workforce
* ""slashes congressional pay and perks""
* cuts to federal travel 
* president gets salary of median income american

Taxes

* corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%
* abolish taxes on repatriation of capital
* extends all bush tax cuts
* abolishes estate tax
* abolishes taxes on personal savings

Regulation

* repeal Obamacare
* repeal Dodd-Frank
* repeal Sarbanes-Oxley
* congressional review of all new regulations
* elimination of all previously issued regulations implemented via Executive Order

Monetary Policy

* Full audit of Federal Reserve
* legalize competing currencies
* cancel all US Government debt to Federal Reserve

The main bulk of the report seems to be comparison charts between the CBO baseline in spending over the next few years and under a hypothetical Paul presidency. There's a pretty detailed breakdown of how spending levels would change over the next three years. There's also a few different graphs and charts to show projected deficit reductions, projected revenues and the proposed cuts in military spending.

What does everyone think?

1,Megathread: White House releases controversial memo on allegations of intelligence abuse,22205.0,7usv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7usv0k/megathread_white_house_releases_controversial/,18714.0,1517592183.0,">(AP) — The White House on Friday declassified a partisan and bitterly disputed memo on the Russia investigation, clearing the way for House Republicans to release allegations of what they say is FBI misconduct.

>The move came over the fierce objections of the FBI and Justice Department, which have said the document prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context.

>The memo alleges that the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

This is a megathread to discuss the authorization and impending release of the House Intelligence Committees memo authored by Rep. Nunes (R-CA). **Please note that off topic and low effort comments may be automatically removed**

We recently resigned from FCC’s broadband committee to shine a light on industry influence on the committee and highlight why we need to ensure everyone has access to broadband. AMA!",2593.0,7wexv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7wexv5/im_shireen_santosham_chief_innovation_officer_of/,143.0,1518196589.0,"If net neutrality is about fair access to highway lanes, then equitable broadband deployment is about giving everyone the chance to buy a car. I’m glad that we’ve been paying attention to net neutrality, and I think we should talk about broadband deployment because internet access is now crucial for everything from finishing homework to applying for jobs. 

Over the past year, I’ve been participating in many meetings of the FCC’s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee along with and on behalf of our mayor. However, we put in our resignation a the end of January because even though there are members with good intentions, it became clear that the industry-heavy group will simply promote the interests of big telecom.

Here are some of San Jose’s efforts on this front:

 - [A recent Interview](https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2018/01/30/living-without-the-internet-in-the-heart-of-silicon-valley/) I gave about the FCC resignation and the digital divide in San Jose

 - My [Congressional testimony] (https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings/race-5g-potential-revolutionize-american-competitiveness/) on rolling out 5G without leaving people behind
 - [San Jose led the charge on defeating California Senate Bill 649] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/opinion/wireless-verizon-telephone-poles.html), which would have given huge subsidies to big telecom and allowed them to put up refrigerator-sized equipment with no oversight
 - Worked on closing the homework gap for all San Jose students through partnerships with [corporate and nonprofit partners] (https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/21/students-receive-free-mobile-tech-to-help-with-homework/) to ensure students have access to broadband at home
 - We authored a [digital inclusion report] (https://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/Digital20Inclusion20Report.pdf) highlighting our 95,000 residents who don’t have access to broadband
 - Launched SpeedUp San Jose to crowdsource 3,000 data points of internet speeds to hold the telecoms industry accountable for their service

108,Hey Americans: Can't laws evolve over time? (reddit: healthcare),0.0,9nsbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9nsbh/hey_americans_cant_laws_evolve_over_time_reddit/,2.0,1253823926.0,"Most times whenever the issue of Healthcare comes up, it seems that most people argue it as an iron-clad writ chiseled into stone. Not the case? Well, let's do a:

Point Counter-Point.
Examples, post-Public Healthcare: US.
1. Healthcare is making us socialist. (What a loathing example as parts of socialist govn't exist already for the better in the U.S., refer to your firemen, cops.)
2. Public Healthcare is too regulated. (If this is the case, then it could have the option to be more stream lined--change the regulations that don't work. Congress re-evaluates based on what the public wants, ignoring corporate lobbying)
3. Public Health is taxing. (Refer to the US Defenses, and start by focusing in on whether the health of the nation outweighs the death and destruction of other countries for the world's safety, again something that can be considered post-nationalized Healthcare and brought to a good equilibrium)
4. Preventative Healthcare is keeping people from 100k$ quad-bypasses, etc. (This is good, and let congress vote to increase benefits, like tax deductions to people who go to get preventative checkups)

Thoughts.
I think right now, we need to trust in something that gets this thing off the ground. The media is stopping the voicing the low percentage of Americans who are going against it (This statement is true, as many are defaming Fox's abilities to broadcast real news). The public needs to trust in change and know that laws can evolve even after they've been passed. 

A main issue that appears to me right now is the close connection between congress and the public. Congress seems to concentrate a dangerous amount of time with corporations who really only have their own intentions in mind. This can be for instance the using of lobbying $$ to make more $$ later on. Why are corporations allowed to essentially bribe congressmen? Let's look here: What does a corporate fast food burger have to do with healthcare? 

Not too much unless you figure that they are really opposites. One agenda might be to lobby for the allowance of heavy transfats/serving (less than .5g) to legally equivalate to ""zero transfats"" on the box, plus having hydrogenated oils, and enriched wheats that include bleach should be kept legal. These lobbying drives only have money in mind. Which is fine for a corporation.

National Healthcare on the lobbying agenda really has no $$ lobbying for itself. This stems from greed in the economy and the lack of greed rooting for it. Hospitals are the ones that should be fighting for this bill to pass, as they will get paid for treatments that are otherwise treated as write-offs. The public as well should be fighting as having essentially an insurance company with the largest pool and no corporate profits, has to win out in many aspects.

Finally.
Anyways, just making sure, to the people who don't fear the future and believe laws can be changed and regulations streamlined: sometimes if you can gather your trust in something, you might have then have the energy to help change it's small deficiencies into something better suited to the greater good. With everyone's help, our system might even be the one that other countries model after. We wouldn't know until we do it.

I answered this question on Quora and it got a modestly significant number of views (about 50 upvotes). but it got removed by moderation, I don't know why. Probably because it upset some Chinese nationalists/pro-Chinese Quorans (Lin Xieyi comes to mind). As we all know, Reddit is a liberal Western echo chamber so I suppose my views will find some resonance here.

I posted it on Quora because I think it's important to debunk some of the ill-informed and simplistic opinions about Singapore's foreign policy toward China. There are too many of those kinds of people voicing those opinions there. And I think too many of our people are not sufficiently educated on our foreign policy positions. This has to change if we are to be immunized against influence operations.

**I am neither pro-China nor anti-China. I am pro-Singapore.**

# Do Singaporeans agree with the ex-diplomat that China is exercising influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore?

At first I didn’t, or was undecided, but now I do.

If you are a PRC patriot, or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations, please stop reading now. It’s for your own good.

Let’s examine the source in question. Who was this “ex-diplomat”?

· Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs

· He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.

· He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.

· Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)

· He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy

· There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence…by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers

· It is possible that the government prefers to use “unofficial” means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives

Now let’s examine the substance of his argument.

That China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.

But Bilahari Kausikan’s concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore’s sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one’s own benefit

Now let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)

But this is not a valid excuse. People who employ this excuse are essentially saying “So what? everyone does it”. To quote the Chinese Ambassador’s response *“I would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different.”* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.

American influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.

But **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable. The appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring.**

​

**SPECULATION ON CHINA’S 2016-2017 INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN**

In August, Huang Jing was exposed for giving *“supposedly ""privileged information"" to a senior member of the LKY School, so it could be passed on to the Singapore Government. The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy”.*

About 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with “very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy”), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China’s rise.

I think we can put two and two together.

I do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani. I think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to. I have no doubt that he earnestly, sincerely believes in the views that he propounds. I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book “Has China Won?”. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.

When Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan’s comment: *“This is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'”*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)

Kausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)

If you don’t have time, I’ll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):

*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position…*

*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing’s influence operations stems from China’s triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*

*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order… On this first track of state-to-state relations, there’s nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*

*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it’s also a Leninist state…and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP’s “magic weapon”… the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party’s interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*

*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation’s history and culture, now rejuvenated…and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office… In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China’s interests and work to advance China’s interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the 华人 (ethnic Chinese) and the 华侨 (overseas PRC citizens)…*

*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China’s influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*

*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride…Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel…But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*

*\[the narrative of China’s absolute rise and America’s inevitable decline\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called “useful idiots”.*

***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental…many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government…Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore’s interests with China’s interest.***

***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016–2017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***

***It’s clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don’t know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***

*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*

This is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.

​

**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**

What is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.

In its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.

This is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us “See, this is what you are doing! Stop it!”. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that “no, actually we’re not doing that. We’re doing THIS”.

**MYTH 1. Surely as a “Chinese country”, Singapore should “explain” China’s position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**

**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**

**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**

**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it “taking sides” with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**

**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn’t know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**

Let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.

**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a “Chinese country”. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore’s identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being “race traitors” by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a “Chinese” identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.

Yes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to “empathize” with it.

But it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China’s claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China’s interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China’s interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.

**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China’s rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US’ intrinsic strengths and some of China’s structural challenges.

China is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.

But what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China’s rise (Mahbubani’s included) tend to take the Whig view of history - “up and up and on and on”

The Chinese never tire of reminding us that China’s presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America’s presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America’s presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.

Asia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.

**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China’s stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.

This is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.

This myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.

Singapore’s policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity “soft” balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than “hard” balancing against China and “hard” bandwagoning with the US.

By the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don’t blame him, I think it’s a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.

So, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.

**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.

Now, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China’s behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.

And in case you think our statement on the PCA’s verdict was somehow “extreme” or “new”, let me read out the statement to you:

>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  
*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  
*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  
*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*

In other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as “taking sides”? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?

Let me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?

Note also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?

Non-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a “hiding” strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.

And while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore…and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?

*“I am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs…but when my security, Singapore’s survival, Singapore’s prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral”* \- Lee Kuan Yew

*“Singapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big ‘trees’ in the region”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *“now that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly…we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers”*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.

But has there been any fundamental change in Singapore’s policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.

The Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao’s China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a “running dog” of the West.

Lee Kuan Yew’s views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.

>*“The Chinese may make a miscalculation…they may become assertive and pushy, which is contrary to their long-term interest, which is to win over the smaller countries in the south to their side”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, 2011  
*“\[My uncle-in-law\] had this romantic idea that, you know, \[China\] is a land of my forefathers. I have no doubts that the land of my forefathers would have brought me down in the world…They (the Chinese) wanted me to contribute \[to my uncle-in-law’s manor house which the Chinese refurbished and made into a historic tourist site\]. I said no, no, I’m not Chinese, I’m Singaporean, I’m not going to visit the place…I have no romantic view about where I sprang from. I’m very grateful that my great grandmother who was born here decided she’s not going to go back (to China) with her husband because she doesn’t know China…I’m a lucky fellow. Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea…I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different. Their dress, their manners, their language. They are a different lot, that’s all. They come from a different society. Of course, at the end of the day they are Chinese.”* \-Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“That romantic idea of going back to the bosom of your motherland is a delusion. We have become different, that’s all. You can go back to China, you’re still different…If you go to China, I don’t think you will belong. They’ll say okay, we’ll accept you. But look at even the Malayan communist cadres who sent their families and children there…- nevertheless, they were treated differently…You think you’re Chinese , and that you will blend in, but you will not. You are already different. We are already different. Just like the American and the British people, or for that matter, the South African whites, Australians, New Zealanders and the British. The Taiwanese mainlanders and Chinese mainlanders, who have not stayed in Taiwan, yes, they are same stock, same heritage, but had different exposure, different standpoints, different views of the world. Are we Chinese? Yes, ethnically. Can we sit down with the Chinese and really feel part of them? Not possible. Because you speak Chinese? No. Your major premises are in your mind” - Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011*  
*“\[The Chinese\] expect us to be more respectful - you must respect me. They tell us countries big or small are equal, we’re not a hegemon, 不称霸. But when we do something they don’t like, they say you have made 1.3 billion people unhappy … So please know your place”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, Hard Truths, 2011  
*“I do not see Singapore surviving on the Chinese economy. If we spoke only Chinese, we would not be today’s Singapore. What is the difference if China is ten times stronger? It will make us ten times stronger? No. Our prosperity comes from linkages with the world…the future is the same. We are not Hainan Island. We are not Hong Kong, where they have no choice. We are in the centre of an archipelago of great diversity, with rich natural resources, and the world will come here”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“How can \[the Chinese object to the American logistics hub here\]? That is crude. If they ask us to stop the logistics base, our answer would be: you can use the logistics base and store your equipment here (so we would host both the Chinese and Americans”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into ‘conscribe’, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am Chinese. They are hypersensistive”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013  
*“You have to accept the fact that they (China) are the biggest boy in the neighbourhood. They will not be the biggest in the Pacific because the US will always be there to counterbalance them. But increasingly, they would be able to keep the US away from the coastal regions. That’s a development we have to accept. No more \[uncomfortable for Singapore\] than for the other countries…It’s even more tricky for Vietnam. We have no conflict of interest with China…we have no such overlapping claims with them.”* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man’s View of the World, 2013

**CONCLUSION**

Let me emphasize again: I see the rise of China as a good thing in the long-term. It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China’s own behaviour.

But in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore’s own national interest - determined by Singaporeans’ own choices ALONE and no one else’s, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I’m only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.

Huang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy. When they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive space, we must continue to quietly, tactfully, but ruthlessly** ***slice those fingers off.***

&#x200B;

The Digital Silk Road (DSR) is part of the Belt and Road initiative (BRI) and aims to [connect countries through technology](https://www.cfr.org/china-digital-silk-road/) like telecommunications networks, artificial intelligence capabilities, cloud computing, e-commerce and mobile payment systems, surveillance technology, smart cities and more. Within the BRI the DSR has become increasingly important since its addition in 2015.

Estimates suggest [one third of BRI countries participate in DSR](https://www.eurasiareview.com/30042019-chinas-digital-silk-road-the-integration-of-myanmar-analysis/). In Africa Chinese information and communication technology (ICT) financing across the continent [surpassed the combined funds](https://merics.org/en/short-analysis/digital-silk-road-development-issue) from African governments, multilateral agencies, and G7 nations. In 2017 the African Union launched a [smart health monitoring system](https://au.int/en/newsevents/20171026/african-union-commission-auc-launches-smart-health-monitoring-system) built by ZTE.

By most estimates DSR investment is going to increase over the coming years as the world economic forum expects a [$15 tn infrastructure investment lack by 2040](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/infrastructure-gap-heres-how-to-solve-it/). DSR products have also shown to be in [high demand throughout the pandemic](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/files/upload/Digital-Silk-Road-Expanding-China-Digital-Footprint.pdf) as governments and private enterprise rush to offer more and better digital services.

By large the DSR aims to stimulate economic growth in recipient countries and to enable more efficient governance. Through the BRI China wields considerable soft power but unlike classic infrastructure investments the DSR has the potential for considerable normative power and yields a trove of data that can be utilized for political gain.

While exporting surveillance technology is hardly unique to China concerns are voiced that ""[China’s view on digital governance has a much more state-paternalistic nature](https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/chinas-digital-silk-road-and-the-global-digital-order/). This differs starkly from the average liberal Western view on digital values and norms, especially that of the United States. The Chinese government enforces strict restrictions on the cyberspace in China. It also does not hesitate to closely monitor its netizens in a considerably sealed off domestic “intranet.”""

In 2020 India [banned 59 mobile apps](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/india-bans-59-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-helo-wechat/articleshow/76694814.cms#:~:text=The%2520Government%2520of%2520India%2520has,country's%2520%25E2%2580%259Csovereignty%2520and%2520security%25E2%2580%259D) as a blow to China’s Digital Silk Route ambitions. The US led effort against Chinese participation in 5G networks (Huawei) is based on the same concerns, namely a loss of sovereignty and threat to national security.

With Beijing becoming the (digital) gravitational center for many nations and it exporting its tools of governance, with all the leverage and influence this provides, do you see this as a possible foundation for a Chinese led block?

In the coming decade(s) could such a block transform the western led world order to more closely align with a Chinese envisioned order or even facilitate ""proper"" multi-polarity?

It seems at the moment that Armenia is retreating from the battlefield, and a ceasefire has been brokered in the nick of time by Moscow. 

This is the biggest shift in the region since 91 and many lives have already been lost, but the question remains what will happen to Nagorno Karabakh now? So we put together an expert panel to take a non-biased, objective look into the fighting, and what the likely fallout will be.

On the panel this week was >>

ALEX RAUFOGLU - (Eurasia Journalist)  
NICK MUTCH - (The Daily Beast/Byline Times) \*\*reporting from the frontlines  
CAREY CAVANAUGH - (Fmr US Ambassador to Eurasian Conflicts)  
LAURENCE BROERS - (Chatham House)

The use of drones proved incredibly decisive on the battlefield here, with the Azeri's destroying the majority of the Armenians armour and air support whilst on the ground. The Israelis and Turks have been supplying large amounts of weapons to the Azeri's now for a number of years, and it proved incredibly definitive on the battlefield. We also address the allegations of other support from Turkey in the form of Syrian mercenaries being hired by Ankara to act as ""shock troops"" for the Azeris, and why Ankara is so interested in the end result of this conflict.   


Now that the majority of the battles have been decided peace terms are now being discussed, with the fate of the Armenians living in the area is still yet to be decided. There are only a few things we know for certain so far, the most pressing of which is vastly increased Russian presence in the region. Russia will now have 3000 peacekeepers on the ground, with full armour and air support, guaranteeing the safety of the remaining Armenians and keeping the crucial ""Lachin corridor"" open. The Russians at the moment have a 5-year mandate in the area, but the question is what happens to the region after that expires?   


More importantly for the other big regional players though It also looks like the Azeris will finally be getting a corridor through Armenia, into their exclave of Nakhchivan. This is not only huge for Baku, but also for Turkey. This new corridor will now provide a dedicated highway from Ankara to the Caspian without having to transit through Georgia. Details are still to be figured out though as to how sovereign the corridor will be, and what will be allowed to travel down it. This will be a huge deal for the region, and the ramifications for which are hard to understate.  


I have covered a lot of ethnic conflicts in my years of writing but this one is something different, this one has far more ethnic venom in it than any other I can think of.

Saudi Arabia and the US was friends thanks to their Cold War relationships where they were fighting atheistic Communism.  With the Cold War over, Saudi Arabia still relies on American weapons system still good from Cold War such as the F-15 and the Patriot missile. However, Saudi Arabia recently had more talks with China and Russia over the sale of Chinese ballistic missiles and Russian air defense systems. Turkey too a democratic country turning authoritarian buys the S-400 system, and US has cancelled their F-35 program with them. Same with Egypt with the purchase of Russian fighter jets and tanks. Same with Iraq with the purchase of the T-90 tank and pretty much a solid alliance with Assad and Iran. We are seeing an end to the US/EU/Saudi/Turkey Israel alliance vs Russia/China/Iran/Syria/North Korea proxy war, and a beginning of a multi polar world

Can the alliances flip?

**Here is why I think it can flip:**

\-China and Russia care less about internal matters and human rights of tyrannical governments, MBS, Sisi and Erdogan will be more attracted to this. Less sanctions etc.

\-China and Russia don't have the institutional bearing. Western alignment may bear Western institution interactions that might propt up values such as democracies in these nations.

\-Open society-Western nations tend to favor open societies where there is more immigration and exchange of values, this only threatens dictatorial power

\-China is a major trading partner to most of the Middle East ,often a lot more so than the US.

\-China does more state run investment programs, while US and its private sector plan often separate.

**Downsides**

\-The US is the world's largest economy. Going against US interests may see global sanctions, and Russia and China can't do anything about it

\-US and the West and Israel have some of the stongest intelligence agencies, going up against them would be a good way to risk potential terror attacks

\-US is the world's strongest military and only superpower. Going up against US interests may be a bad idea if it wants the US to protect them or even avoid military confrontation

\-Nations still rely on the West to develop sectors in Finance, techonlogy and education.

&#x200B;

**What China could do**

\-Overpower the US economy, increase trade deals and expand BRI

\-Have more of a presense in fighting terrorism

\-Increase military power. This means accelerating its aircraft carrier program to a full blown 6 carriers to provide striking power in the Middle East. To rival US bombers in Qatar, China could run bombers from Djobouti and Pakistan.

\-Accelerate its tech such as 5G networks for the global economy

&#x200B;

Of course this won't be a complete flip. US will be crucial to defending against a Iranian threat. However, a lot of the alliance is slipping and the Middle East maybe examining other models of government rather than the traditional idea of the world ending up to be a democracy. A reminder, the US planned an invasion of Saudi Arabia after 1973 to secure oil supplies. A more capable US in producing oil, posses a major challenge to OPEC. With the Khasougi killings and increased light against MBS and the slow liberalization of Saudi Arabia, the states may see the US as a major problem and eventually align with China.",geopolitics,5G

In addition, China asked the UK for its expertise on finance in order to bring more transparency and efficiency to BRI projects, and it seems that the UK is eager to join the ride.

How are the big superpowers going to react tho this massive chaos?

&#x200B;

***What's happening***

The healthcare system in northern Italy is already clogged and beginning to collapse, not because of its quality (one of the best in the world) but because its budget was cut in the last 20 years, resulting in undersized hospitals. They are very competent, but it doens't matter if there are not enough beds. Germany has 3 times more intensive care units, for example.

This is the main reason of very different policies put in place by different countries. Italy was forced to stop the whole nation to avoid as much as possible a global healthcare collapse, exactly like China did.

Germany and UK decided not to stop the country, because they are doing the math, using Italian statistics, and they probably think they will be ""fine"". It's a big risk, but loosing their economy is a big risk too.

The U.S. are reacting very poorly, for now. This also adds up to the economic crisis. Trump is loosing (even more) his face, but he is now forced to take strong measures.

Let's go back to Italy, the country in the EU that got affected first: we know that Italy is taking a huge economical hit because its politicians didn't invest enough in healthcare budgets, they instead cut those budgets for decades. And if Italy goes down, the whole E.U. goes down. BCE knows this but Lagarde (president of BCE), instead of reassuring the economy, came out with a criminal statement, resulting in a market disaster. BCE is now carefully backtracking on her statement, but damage is done, and EU integrity is undermined.

As we can see the economy is already in the trash bin. Considering that the infection rate is identical everywhere (most of other countries are 8-9 days late compared to Italy), we can only expect the economy to go even further down, as soon as everyone is in Italy's shoes.

&#x200B;

***Some speculations***

If you think globally, the oil crisis is adding up to the virus crisis. What are the chances that the following things are happening at the same time just by coincidence?

\- U.S. doing an oversized exercitation along the Russian border (unprecedented).

\- NATO demanding an upgrade of Europe's infrastucture for military transit (drastic and unprecedented).

\- Putin and the OPEC drama, resulting in an actual oil price war.

\- Epicenter of the pandemic virus being in Wuhan, location of an institution of virology that studies military biological weapons.

\- Virus outbreak happening just when the Chinese New Year is about to start, exactly when hundreds of millions of people travel in and out of China every year.

\- Nuclear arms race reaching an unprecedented level (this slow process goes back since 2001).

\- The ""new Silk Road"" agreements, that would enpower Eurasia economy over the U.S. (unprecedented amount of money involved).

&#x200B;

***Conclusions***

We are witnessing history. The entire world's geopolitics are in motion to rewrite its primary powers, with China climbing at an insane rate (GDP, nuclear, new silk road, 5g, ecc...), and Russia acting and reacting strongly for its own interests (new missile system, internet independence, oil wars, ecc...).

All this will undermine the U.S. leadership and empower the Eurasian continent. How will the U.S. react, knowing its foreign policies of supremacy are under attack? Is this the meaning of the NATO agreements and of Europe Defender 20?

My hope is that this pandemic will have a role of de-escalation of some sorts, because if just one big country collapses, the whole world is potentially in danger. For sure the timing of this pandemic is absolutely crazy. Even without being paranoid, one can't avoid to raise serious questions that need answers.

***My questions to you, fellow redditors:***

\- Do you agree to this analysis?

\- Is this reality or just semi-paranoid speculation?

\- How threatened do you feel right now by the geopolitic tensions?

Please feel free to correct any mistakes I made, I want this to be an open discussion, I'm not a geopolitical analyst or journalist. I just happened to suddently have a lot of free time since I'm from northern Italy, and took a heavy interest in geopolitics during my sleepless nights :D",geopolitics,5G

The obvious explanation is there's a technology deficit, but Huawei has a solid 5g portfolio and I'd imagine China is leading in some industries by now (renewable). In terms of US, I remember an US cyber security expert rationalise that even if there's state level espionage, the US does not have a process to distribute the knowledge to private companies. But at the same time, we know US conducts industrial espionage on allies, and US companies steal from each other. Is it just a matter of NSA and China not disclosing attacks? It seems unlikely that the US doesn't have access to Weibo user data or the equivalent of Chinese OPM databases.",geopolitics,5G

>Japan has totally missed the new digital revolution and I do not think it is likely that they will catch up. When you think of the most advanced smartphone designs, laptop manufacturers, chipmakers, 5G vendors etc., top consumer electronics manufacturers and designers, you won't find many Japanese companies on top.

>Chinese(Taiwan included) and Korean companies are the new kings of technology. Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, TSMC, LG, Acer, ASUS dictate the field of technology, not Sony. The Chinese are more vigorous in pursuing machine learning and AI as well as automation than the Japanese are. Wechat, Tencent, Alibaba are all successful Mainland Chinese startups and some of the most valuable companies in the world.

>In fact, if you look at the tech that Japan is good at, you'll find that it is a holdover from the 1980s and 1990s. Vehicle manufacturing and video games. But even in vehicle manufacturing, Japan is facing strong competition from its neighbors. BYD, Geely, Kia, Hyundai are all catching up fast to the Japanese giants.

>The days of everybody holding a Japanese Walkman, using a Japanese computer, listening to tapes on a Japanese radio and relying on Japanese transistors are long gone. The small technological lead in some fields that Japan still has is fast becoming obsolete.

>My guess as to why this has happened is simply that the Japanese became complacent. This development is ironic considering how tough and hard-driving their working culture is. Anecdotally, I think that Tokyo looks like it is stuck in the 1990s while Shanghai and Seoul are the symbols of modernity in Asia and this is symbolic of the legacy of the lost decade that they have never been able to recover from. Their population isn't ""hungry"" enough for success unlike their neighbors who were living in crushing poverty until fairly recently and this has an effect on their innovation.

The crackdown against tech companies and tech leaders by the Chinese government seems to reveal a regime that is unsure on the strategy toward achieving their goals in tech self-reliance and even global supremacy. The Chinese government has poured resources into supporting innovators in 5G, AI, semiconductors, ecommerce and social media but then turns around and seems to want an increasing level of control the more successful and dominant that leaders in those businesses become.

China's returns on their investments in tech supremacy are okay in some some areas and [not so good in others](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20210618151742446) ([2](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4199737)).

While China does have the larger economy and probably a much more powerful military by now, it is very dependent on foreign fuel supplies. It cannot afford to be international pariah(yet) otherwise an oil embargo from the US Saudi Arabia (or a a straight up US blockade) would be disastrous. Xi may not be able to get on Putin's bad side for China will need Russia to give it oil supplies if international pariahdom does come. Unlike Russia, China is surronded by far more enemies. 

Now BRI is a good way for China to traverse its way to more oil from both Central Asia and Iran. The problem I see is that Central Asia is still very Kremlin friendly and Iran(I think) is far more closer to Putin, a major weapon supplier and security guarantee of its proxies.

In order for China to break out of this deadlock, it must invest in alternative energy sources(its doing that) as well as strengthen its blue water navy(trying to) as well as buy a larger tactical nuclear arsenal to potentially fight a land battle in Central Asia.(\~600 warheads by 2025). China in the meantime offer Russia more strategic partnerships and cooperation, a good example China offering Russia 5G while Russia offering China oil.

22,"Are there any books, documentaries or even interesting youtube videos on the Geopolitics of the Dark Web?",22.0,i209rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/i209rc/are_there_any_books_documentaries_or_even/,9.0,1596317572.0,"So I've been watching a few videos on the dark web and also the competition between the United States and China.

The internet is broken into three parts. The SURFACE WEB is basically news sites, social media, anything you can find on google/bing etc. The next level is the DEEP WEB, which is basically anything behind any kind of password protected material e.g. your email account, ibanking account etc. Finally, you have the DARK WEB which are websites that cannot be found, unless you specifically know the address of the website.

While most of the world uses the SURFACE WEB, there is virtually no privacy on the surface web. People post their entire lives on social media and companies take your data and sell it to advertisers. In contrast, there is complete and total privacy on the DARK WEB. People use cryptocurrencies/bitcoins to make financial transactions - the nature of this currency is that it is untraceable. The DARK WEB has positive but also negative manifestations; from allowing dissidents in foreign countries to speak freely and safely, to Red Rooms (I'll let you use youtube or google to figure out what those are). 

So this got me thinking. 

If the United States is worried about China constructing 5G infrastructure all over the world in order to collect data and make rapid advances in artificial intelligence and increase the pace of their technological advancement (which would then allow them to sell all this technology to other countries/markets and strengthen their economic/technological dependence on China);

then why doesn't the USA just adopt a long term strategy to shift all of its activities on the SURFACE WEB, over to the DARK WEB to deny China access to that data?",geopolitics,5G
23,When it comes to the Serbia-Kosovo deal read the fine print and double check that it's being followed.,17.0,ipnkqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ipnkqg/when_it_comes_to_the_serbiakosovo_deal_read_the/,4.0,1599680764.0,"I know on the surface it seems like that recent diplomatic breakthrough between Serbia and Kosovo was a huge win for the United States. Serbia and Kosovo have agreed to normalize economic relations with eachother, Serbia has agreed to end lobbying efforts against the recognition of Kosovo for a year, and both countries have agreed to ban Huawei from their 5G networks and move their embassies to in Israel to Jerusalem. 

On the surface is seems like Serbia is clearly changing orbits to the US sphere of influence. desalinating its conflict with a US ally, and backing US diplomatic initiatives against China and for Israel. However there are a few fine details that are important not to miss. 

First of all it's one thing to agree to all of this. It's another to actually do it. Serbia had already violated its obligation to end its campaign to diplomatically isolate Kosovo for a year. Serbia has stated it wont [move its embassy to Jerusalem if Israel recognizes Kosovo](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/serbia-wont-move-embassy-if-israel-recognizes-kosovo-641600). So it hasn't even been a week and Serbia is back to lobbying countries not to recognize Kosovo, despite it's supposed obligations to end its lobby campaign for a year.

As for the Kosovo-Israel deal. Kosovo has been trying to get Israel to recognize it for years, offering in return for said recognition to open a embassy in Jerusalem and recognize it as Israel's capital. Up until now Israel has resisted making such a deal. Israel felt it wasn't in its interests due to its historic ties to Serbia, and it was worried about the precedent Kosovo set for unilateral deceleration of independence. 

However from Washington's perspective it's not ideal to have two of its allies, Kosovo and Israel not recognize each other so it looks like it pushed the deal through. Overall this does seem to be a good deal for Washington, but we will have to see how much of it will actually be implemented. Serbia has already seemed to have backed out of ending its diplomatic campaign against Kosovo for a year, and moving its embassy to Jerusalem. We will see if it will stick to the other parts of the deal such as the Huawei ban and economic normalization. 

In addition we will have to see the Trump administrations reaction to Serbia seemingly backing out of parts of the deal. As the economic boons to Serbia promised by the deal where conditions on Serbia ending its diplomatic pressure on various countries to not recognize Kosovo. So Serbia already backing out of that obligation is not a good sign for the deal as a whole.",geopolitics,5G
