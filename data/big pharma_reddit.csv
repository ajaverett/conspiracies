2,They are BANNING BOOKS in parts of the US and not a single post about it has gained traction here.

> To know who rules you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.

&
> Rules for thee, not for me.

As books are banned in conservative parts of America, for NOT BEING PATRIOTIC ENOUGH no less, where, I ask you, is the outrage over this silencing of books and voices that criticize America??

Why is free speech a rule that must be observed for some causes in America, and silenced for others?  Why are these ""approved"" causes for censorship so consistently associated with the right wing of politics? And why are they so consistently invoked to protect the power of the nation-state? 

Let me bring in a quote from another book about tyranny, one that has been banned again and again with no sense of irony – Fahrenheit 451.

> The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are.

This half-assed approval of free speech and dangerous half-acceptance of censorship is making asses and fools of us all.

Here's my most controversial take for this sub:

You cannot be merely conservative and think that makes you a conspiracy theorist.

This was never true, as conspiracy theories are fundamentally critical of the state and the political parties that control it. But not it is all the more important to wake up to the new development:

The conservative wing of the US government has, in a calculated fashion, captured the narrative of conspiracy theories in order to manipulate their voter base into action that serves their desire to amass and secure power.

If you are conservative and consume the media of conspiracy theories, you are now a demographic, endlessly studied and prodded by messaging campaigns, seeded narratives, and daily doses of programming — the bluest of pills — that is being manipulated to serve a class of elites who are in no way ACTUALLY interested in the supposed tenets of conservatism.  

* Small government is no longer in *their* interest, but they'll keep selling you a line as if it is.

* Dismantling the surveillance is no longer in *their* interest, but they'll keep selling you a line as if it is.

* Taking down Wall St. and Big Pharma are no longer in *their* interest, but they'll keep selling you a line as if it is.

* Putting an end to censorship is no longer in *their* interest, but they'll keep selling you a line as if it is.

Both Left and Right are utterly fooled by the media machine that gives the marching orders. This would ideally be a space that transcends that. But there are so so many of you still deeply asleep.

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

For all is not necessarily *what it seems.* In fact, I suggest that you take heart in the fact that what is coming, is *so much more* incredible and amazing beyond your wildest dreams. Here’s what it really is:  

**The short version:** Humanity is now “officially” in the process of its long-prophesized *spiritual awakening.* Right from the Mayans tellingly ending their calendar in the year 2012 to ideas such as *“The second coming of the Christ”* (in Christianity), *Qiyāmah* in Islam and *Satya Yuga* in Hinduism and the like (in other religions), it has been foretold that humanity will one day be freed from those very forces of darkness that have enslaved and occupied their beautiful world for millennia. While the religious books and descriptions mentioned above have been corrupted (by the powers-that-be) to indicate things other than those *of the* ***TRUTH*** – it nevertheless stands that the time for humanity’s mass awakening, is just about NOW.  

**The long version:** Ask yourself – does humanity seem like a *happy species* to you by any means? What part of living in democracy (or communism or whatever) do you *really like?* The education? The financial freedom? The fundamental human rights? The safety? The warmth? The peace? The love?

Alas! You have absolutely *none* of that good shit here! You are – and have been made – slaves to a system that seeks to exploit you day in and day out. Your hard earned money is funnelled into wars – that’s murdering people by the way – and those who declare those wars live in great wealth, prosperity and joy. And supporting those murders makes you all *patriotic* and *honourable* and all that shit. Everything and everyone from your cops and your politicians -- to your media, pharma industry, petroleum industry, justice system, corporates, military, religion, educational system and *absolutely everything else there is* seeks only and ONLY to ENSLAVE you, EXPLOIT you, RAPE you, PLUNDER you, and DESTROY AND TAKE AWAY *every single thing* that your heart truly yearns for and *stands for.*  

Hate takes the place of love. Fear takes the place of joy. Mediocrity replaces creativity and anger replaces compassion.  

THIS is NOT who YOU are. In fact, what you are is a CREATOR BEING. A being that is powerful enough to create ENTIRE UNIVERSES AT WILL – even though such seems to be a ridiculous statement to hear at this moment.  

Nevertheless, most of humanity has long been asleep to the existence of the chains that have been wrapped around its neck for millennia – and that have recently been getting tightened day by day – because your *masters* have been forewarned of something that may cause them something of a headache.  

Alas, TRUTH cannot be stopped just because it is inconvenient to one, and therefore, both – humanity as well as those who have enslaved it – are in for something of a *rude shock.* And the *ONE AND ONLY ONE* way for humanity to make it through this crisis is by TRAINING THEIR MINDS to make them more peaceful, more loving, more compassionate, more forgiving, more wise, more blissful and more POWERFUL. And time’s running out *a little too fast* for all of that, folks.  

What some of you are experiencing as reality “popping out” or looking clearer, sharper and in better colour is basically the same effect as that which one experiences during an acid trip. It is the effect that is caused when ALL FILTERS placed upon every human being’s mind (by the powers-that-be) begin to come off. And reality is seen for what it TRULY IS.  

Much like the dream and the dreamer are ONE (all *lucid dreamers* will get this) – in much the same way, YOU and your EXTERNAL REALITY are ONE. You are one and the same thing – and joined at the root – much like different fingers belonging to the same hand are all joined to the same SINGULAR body. That body is what some have called *God.*  

What you are experiencing now, is your return to that very UNITY consciousness. A consciousness, in which you CAN AND WILL (ultimately) experience ONENESS/UNITY with ALL of that reality that you deem to be *""outside"" of yourself.* For everyone you meet, is indeed, an aspect of YOU. Kind of like what they said in [**The Egg**](https://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) – its video version [**can be found** ***here***]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI).  

Now obviously, those who represented darkness aren’t gonna give up here without a fight. The *Coronavirus* was their final and very last weapon (aimed at destroying *all of humanity*) in retaliation. Needless to say – it’s not working *as damn well* as they intended it to. And it’s *too late now* for them to prevent their own impending demise *now*. (And yes, we've indeed had some help here from, ""high places"" etc. * wink wink *).  

So in the months and the years to come – EVERY SINGLE LIE told by them will be exposed. ALL corrupt people and individuals and agencies working against mankind will be exposed and ousted. Humanity will once again begin coming together in love, peace, co-operation, abundance, joy and harmony. It is our *destiny* to experience this.  

INCREDIBLE hidden technologies will be revealed that will make ALL of life a cakewalk for ALL of us. People will live longer and healthier and happier lives. Lack of money and/or poverty won’t EVER be a problem ever again. ALL pollution will be erased. ALL THINGS that are fucked up within our worlds from shitty education systems to shitty religious structures and shitty what-have-yous would be erased for good – ***once and for all.*** There will be ***NO MORE*** **human exploitation.** It will be *our ""happily ever after""* – this time for *good.* And, oh yes, it will *AT LAST* be revealed to the public that we aren’t really all alone in this endless AF universe after all. And that we never really *were* alone in the first place to even as much as begin with. *What fun!*  

The next few months and years will be something of a ""bumpy ride"" – and will bring to light some INCREDIBLY DARK AND DISTURBING FACTS about what has been going on upon this planet since an EXTREMELY LONG period of time. At such times, when you find yourselves angry, simply forgive and move on – no matter *how difficult* it gets. For you can’t do much to change the past. The future, however, that’s something you can TOTALLY look forward to. And you’ll soon begin seeing some exciting new technological (and other) developments being released -- that have been purposely held back from humanity from a long, loooong time by those wishing to *use us* and *keep us enslaved.* Stay focused on *that,* it’s just *better.* (Besides, what *energy* you focus on, you only continue to get *more of* in your life. So yeah, choose your thoughts, your beliefs and your focus *wisely!*) .

Keep this link copied with you and **feel free to share it** with any of your friends or loved ones who are scared, confused, and/or have no clue as to *what the fuck in all living hell* is breaking loose right now. Because they’re gonna be needing that shit, just about *right, fucking, now.*

Unfortunately my father isn’t one of those people.

Prior to his booster, my father was a hard working, successful man. He was bringing in about 20k a month, had a beautiful home, and a decent life overall. That all changed once he got his booster in December.

He went for his booster shot on 12/23 at 10AM. I arrived at his house at around 8PM to find him on the floor, unresponsive, covered in a pool of urine.

Called 911, brought him into the hospital. Told every doctor and nurse that he had gotten his booster about 8-10 hours ago, they all looked at me as if I was insane.

Turns out my dad had a stroke. What are the odds my healthy father coincidentally has a stroke 8 hours after receiving his booster? Pretty damn slim. 

Since then, he’s been a wreck. He hasn’t been able to work, his cognitive state is decaying, his memory is awful, he has no motivation to do anything. He used to be a healthy active man, since the stroke he stopped cooking for himself, stopped exercising, eats like shit, and hasn’t been able to return to his job. He’s now back in the hospital for a blood clot in his leg and narrowly missed amputation. He is going to have no choice but to sell his home as he cannot continue to afford it with no income.

Thank you big pharma for ruining my fathers life! And taking away from mine. But of course, whenever I mentioned it to any healthcare professional, I would get shrugged off as if I’m some conspiracy theorist moron. Fuck Pfizer, fuck Moderna, and fuck all the corrupt assholes who are getting rich and living with no stress while the middle class citizens suffer. Fuck you!!!!

They are *desperate* to cover up the effectiveness of Ivermectin for Covid.   Keep getting the word out about Ivermectin and how safe and effective it is.  We are obviously over the target with this.

The Emergency Use Authorization requires there to be no effective treatment from a previously FDA approved drug. If ivermectin is as effective as it appears to be, vaccines would have never been able to get EUA and would have had to do their full and normal trials before full FDA approval.  This is what big pharma and their bootlicking shills are panicking about.

One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades.

25,"Citizen contacts Maryland Department of Health to find out why they are so keen to push the HPV jab on 11yo children, they cannot provide evidence, so he files a freedom of information request and discovers they've been bribed/lobbied by $91.6 million of washed Big Pharma money to market the vaccine",2640.0,97i2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/97i2d2/citizen_contacts_maryland_department_of_health_to/,321.0,1534338374.0,"Josh Mazer is pro-vaccine, but wants vaccines to be based on sound scientific evidence and not to cause more harm than good, he also believes in providing informed consent on the risks/dangers of each vaccine.

His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being ""forced"" against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more.  

The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy.  He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine.  He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn't provide any evidence either.  Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDC’s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.

Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.  

Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.

Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Maryland’s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.

Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christina’s life.""

So in short:-  

1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money
2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials
3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government
4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms
5. Rinse and repeat

28,Prolonged fasting [with healthy diet]: the cure/treatment for virtually all chronic conditions the health industry and Big Pharma want kept secret,2439.0,jp2nrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jp2nrr/prolonged_fasting_with_healthy_diet_the/,937.0,1604657609.0,"Prolonged fasting means not eating anything for 1-2 days or more, drinking only water, preferably water with sodium and potassium added. This is different from intermittent fasting which is too weak to do much because you're only fasting \~16 hours and eating in an 8 hour window. It's still better than what the vast majority of people do, but it doesn't give you the best benefits of fasting. Personally I do mostly One Meal A Day with the occasional longer fast for the health benefits.

For years now I have been reading about fasting, talked to many people who have done it, and live a fasting focused lifestyle myself. I've read many scientific articles about it, learned from a few doctors who have also researched fasting and use it such as Dr. Jason Fung, as well as the testimonies from people who have used fasting to cure practically everything from cancer and aids to autoimmune issues to pathogen infections to injuries and broken bones. It works on literally everyone who has access to adequate nutritious food for refeeds, from children to the elderly.

I'm posting about it here because despite the uncountable scientific studies and evidence, there is a kind of conspiracy from the health industry and big pharma to keep this knowledge from you. They want you to believe fasting for days at a time is dangerous and unhealthy when all the science indicates the opposite. They instead tell you to eat multiple meals a day to keep your metabolism high and that fasting lowers it. Fasting actually increases your metabolism and it only begins to drop a little below normal if you've been fasting for like a week or so. More importantly who cares? Your metabolism is always in various dips and rises. Besides which once you refeed your metabolism goes back to normal. But I digress. The health industry has a messed up food circle where they glorify grains and other processed food even though we know it's bad for us, especially in the quantities they recommend. The fact that added sugar and vegetable oils are on the Generally Regarded As Safe list is criminal when we've had scientific research proving the dangers of both years before they became a staple of the American diet.

Whenever I try to tell people about the benefits of prolonged fasting I'm almost always met with derision and disbelief, and it doesn't change even when I provide evidence. Even on r/fasting the people are ironically ignorant about fasting, saying things like fat children can't fast and must eat multiple meals a day or it will stunt their growth, which isn't close to true. You will also get banned there as I did for speaking about dry fasting, even though it's perfectly safe and healthy if you know what you're doing and what your body can handle. I wouldn't have a fat kid do a 7 day fast nor a dry fast, even though he could, I would have him do 48s with some 72s just to be careful and this is [perfectly healthy and safe for a fat child](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk-v_LHhHPo/?hl=en). Honestly just use that sub for motivation because their knowledge about fasting is woefully lacking and the mods insist on staying ignorant. If you need help with or have more questions about fasting, use my sub instead: r/fastinghelp.

While there are tons of scientific studies about the benefits of fasting, the thing most people seem to want are studies that specifically show fasting is specifically able to cure cancer. I try to explain to them that of course such a study doesn't exist and never will because modern medicine considers fasting dangerous and would never allow or consider a study that had even volunteered sick people do what is in their eyes a dangerous treatment. To speak nothing of the immeasurable millions that would be required to fund such a study to the proper degree that people would consider it valid. Who would spend that kind of money to prove a free treatment works when there's no profit in doing so? Furthermore, while fasting is simple, fasting to cure a problem especially one like cancer is no easy feat and requires a strict routine that is adhered to stringently, usually for a few months.

3 months ago someone dm'ed me here on Reddit asking for more information about my claims of fasting curing cancer because their dad has colon cancer and could die from it and the doctors are useless as usual. So I told him about fasting and other things and his dad started doing it, being desperate enough to try anything. Within the first week of the routine the dad's tumor stopped causing bleeding in his rectum. A month later the tumor stopped growing and had begun to shrink. A few days ago I asked and the tumor is continuing to shrink, and tumor markers are showing the results of a healthy person. The dad's life has been completely changed via virtually free treatments anyone can do. [Here is a woman who cured her brain cancer in the course of a few months, baffling her doctors](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcb1TCjF1xj/). There are countless more testimonials like these. Me personally I've seen it heal wounds and injuries quicker and get me recovered from the cold/flu quicker. Used to I would catch a virus at least once every year, for decades. Once I made fasting a part of my life and cleaned up my diet I haven't gotten sick since. \[What I mean is in the early days I was experimenting with fasting but hadn't fully committed to it. I was still eating multiple meals a day and eating garbage food. It wasn't until I switched to omad and a healthy diet that I no longer became sick.\]

There are many things that happen when you prolong fast such as the activation of autophagy, the lowering of insulin, activation of apoptosis, increase of stem cells (which protects your muscles from degradation), the balance of hormones, giving the digestion a break, regenerating the immune system (upon refeeding), and many more. The benefits of fasting have been proven to be beneficial in virtually all forms of life from bacteria and yeast to insects to rodents to humans.

To go into all the specific details of everything would be a near impossible task for a mere Reddit post. There is tons of literature about all of this. I will instead link to some interesting studies and reports discussing some of these things. This but a tiny sampling of what you can find if you do some research.

Fasting for 3-5 days has been shown to regenerate the immune system by breaking down the old and weak white blood cells. This is the secret to being able to withstand pathogens such as the cold/flu and even covid (not that covid is much worse than the seasonal flu) and why I do not fear it or any natural pathogen. It's true that during this period your immune system is slightly weaker, and some websites try to spin this to say fasting lowers your immune system. While technically true, what they don't say is that upon refeeding your body makes brand new healthy and strong white blood cells ready to attack pathogens in your body. This is why a guy who did a 40 day straight fast did not cure his cancer, but the people who go on a routine of fasting followed by eating followed by more fasting over the course of a few months do cure their cancer. If you keep your immune system high from the beginning and stay that way cancer will be something you need no longer fear because your immune system won't allow it to get out of hand. Cancer is not some mysterious condition the health industry tries to make you believe.

There is so much more to learn and talk about regarding fasting, but this post is long enough. All these years later and I'm still learning new things about fasting and health and nutrition. Fasting here is just the tip of the iceberg of health secrets the health industry and Big Pharma don't want you to know about.

Note: I don't believe doctors are ""in on it"" but rather they are taught wrong in med school. Instead it is whoever is responsible for determining what gets accept by the health industry and gets taught to people in med school that is to blame, because they are the ones denying science in the name of profit. It's more profitable and you get repeat business if you, for example, sell type 2 diabetics insulin and pills (which is like giving an alcoholic more alcohol) instead of getting the person on a fasting routine and low carb diet to cure their T2D, which is exactly what Dr. Jason Fung does in Canada.",conspiracy,big pharma

31,The biggest conspiracy of all is the mushroom conspiracy,2270.0,yvgwlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yvgwlw/the_biggest_conspiracy_of_all_is_the_mushroom/,572.0,1668470289.0," Here’s why:  
1. Stoned ape theory. Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense actually.    

2. You can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don’t.    

3. Mushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.    

4. The best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn’t other fungus fight other bacteria’s and viruses? Well they do. People aren’t educated about them and fear them.    

5. Mycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon.     

6. Even the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can’t hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.    

7. Every breath you take has spores. These things are very significant…    

8. In ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty commoners were punished for having them.    

9. On the Joe Rogan show with Paul stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, “I can’t talk about this because I could get killed”     

10. The oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old….these things are incredibly evolved and don’t even need to have sex (and they even look like a penis when they spread their “seed”). You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.

11. I have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating these and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms,     

12. A lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms.     

13. There are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say    

14. Maria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.    

15. I fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill work well synonymously.    

16. There are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?    

17. There are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.    

18. lion’s mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. the 5000 year old mummified corpse Ötzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. it may have been used as medicine.    

19.LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.    

20. ergotamine is also used in a migraine medicine called cafergot. it was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but it still works for many people.    

21. If you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it’s a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I’ve seen is that they love that shit.I have seen families of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colony’s build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows the nat flys love them.    

22. The fact that they call the brain the “default mode network” when you become an adult and so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain is lit up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording “default mode network”    

23. Cordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it solves the problem completely.  I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are a symbiotic relationship when we eat them 🤷‍♂️     

24. It is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here is it really safety?    

25. Im saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I asked my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, “have I heard of it? Im a victim of it!” I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.  

If life is a test I don’t think it’s a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.     Does anyone agree with this? Let me know your thoughts. Please help share this post.",conspiracy,big pharma

We have the potentials for so much abundance for all, but a select group of power thirsty power over others, service to self group of psychopaths are not satisfied with what they have and always seek more. This is what greed is. Truly advanced technologies that could benefit all of mankind, suppressed because it would put these ""elites"" out of control and power. We no longer need to call them elite, for they are not. They are scum of the earth and are in direct harm to mankind itself and wish nothing more than for us to destroy ourselves while they laugh on the side lines.

These are the powers that were. The cabal. The Illuminati. The Shadow Government. Names come and go, but their dark tentacles linger in the shadows.

Their gig is up. Their time is over. The show is up for them and they know it. This is a Spiritual Play of Cosmic proportions and we are all actors in one giant awakening and remembering of divine consciousness and remembrance of what and who we are. Their negativity, control, fear, and war has done a toll on this earth, but it also back fired on them. When you go so far into the darkness, it only makes it that much easier to snap back into the light. We have been held in a dark quagmire for so long, have felt the emptiness of what dark truly is, and have made our collective choice to wake the fuck up and move the fuck on from this barbaric system we have constructed. Total chaos it may look like to all of us looking at reality right now. The truth is, change is always happening, and for a new reality that we all collectively want to happen, all old negative belief systems of control and patterns must break down. I have posted many times about the Mayan Calendar and how the 2012 end times scare was truly a new birth of consciousness for man kind. A golden age of consciousness if you will. This has been heavily documented and researched and has been a pretty interesting topic of discussion. 

You may ask where I am going with all of this. What I am leading up to. When you make the personal choice to start finding the truth of our reality, things happen. Synchronicity, Mandela Effect, Law of Attraction, Numerology. You begin to notice patterns and realize things are a lot more connected than you realize and there is a hidden world all around us that we cannot see.

I love quoting Nikola Tesla to make a comparison for this. 

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.""

We all exist on a certain frequency or wave length. Our bodies are dialed into this third dimensional time frame of existence. We all resonate to this frequency, thus we are all in tune with each other and the third dimension itself. If you have heard of Mass Consciousness, it ties into this. This is why group meditations can be so powerful. 

Now, think about if you truly knew the truth of our reality, and could manipulate that global consciousness to your own will. Like a few Border Collies slowly leading a group of sheep in a direction. I hate using the sheep analogy but I hope I am providing a picture for you here. 

Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let's others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others. The Law of One is what this understanding is. Because we are behind a veil of amnesia, and do not truly know or remember everything we have experienced, it makes this illusionary reality seem ""real"" it makes it seem like you are your body and nothing more. It makes it so easy to think and believe that. I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.

This is where this all takes a dark, dark, turn. Some people think God is a fairy tale. That is all fine and dandy. But there is a legitimate group of people. These 8,000 - 8,5000 people believe that Lucifer is God and that he is the true light. They Rebel against creation itself and attack, control, destroy it. 

A lot of them are luciferians. Some are Satanists. The thing is, this all boils down to Zionism. A long, long, deep rooted system of beliefs that has permeated mankinds existence even since the biblical times and has been documented in the Bible. The Israelites being casted away to Babylon. 

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

This brings me to my next horrid truth of reality. ""Satanic"" Sex Rings. The inspiration for this post comes from the repeated comments I see of people saying ""Satanic Sex Rings are Fake"" and ""Satanic Panic all over again""

There is a reason these tales exist in the first place. And I am going to provide proof to you that this world is run, and controlled, by these 8,000 - 8,500, and how they use Satanic Sex Rings, MKUltra Monarch Mind Control, to Split victims personalities. And how blackmail is collected on people wishing to get into power structures or into ""the top of the pyramid"" where access is only given to those that allow themselves to be taped having sex with kids. Or worse...  This is dark stuff, but it needs to be discussed. This is how these 8,000 - 8,500 psychopaths run the world, and also gives them protection from Good people trying to go after them because they ultimately control key positions of power and prevent investigations from going forth. This is why they hate awareness. This is why they hate Unity.

Divide and conquer is their favorite tool. Get your enemy distracted fighting themselves, and they are less of a threat to your own agenda.

Get mankind so hateful towards itself, towards the ""other"" persons skin color and sexual orientation of preference. They stand no chance to take you down when we are busy dividing ourselves.

This is their bread and butter. This is why we have share blue. Why we attract trolls and shills. This is why astroturfing exists. This is why you can follow the money and find out the truth. If you control the world, you control the money. If you control the money, you control the people. If you control the people, you control the world. You control media, you control Big Pharma, you control access to technology. You set up this big ploy of Russia vs United states then while the citizens of both countries are scared and fighting each other, the powers that were sit in the stands laughing and cheering as fellow man destroy themselves, completely oblivious to the spectators looking on and instigating us.

This game is rigged folks. This reality is controlled. The chains have moved from the physical to the spiritual.

This is the big conspiracy. This is where it all leads to.

Please. Watch these videos. Educate yourself. Bring awareness and light to this subject. Drop seeds of truth here and there with friends and family. Look for the truth and you will find it because the truth is within us. The moment you look outside yourself for the truth that is the moment you confirm you do not have the truth. Always truth your own intuition. Your own awareness and gut feelings. 

Let's come together as one, as we truly are. And free this world from the shackles that it has been placed in for thousands of years. I implore you, a fellow human, to please ponder these things and find a way to help in your own manner. We can stop this TODAY if we collectively chose to do so.

Anytime someone says pedophile rings do not exist, link them to this thread. Share these videos and links with them. Let them come to their conclusion and realize that this is indeed happening. Some will refuse. The more mankind awakens, the further some will create lies to continue their safe reality they have created for themselves. This is fine. We cannot push judgments or opinions as we all have our own way of viewing reality and if people wish to remain ignorant to the truth, that is their choice to do so.

We do not need to waste energy attacking each other anymore. Pushing opniions and trying to create a i am right you are wrong scenario only further divides us and builds ego and fills our heads. I have been guilty of it countless times and will be the first to admit that we all make mistakes and I have given in to emotions more times than I can count. It is time we take responsibility for our actions and realize the consequences of the choices we sometimes choose to make. Mistakes are bound to happen and we need to use them as a learning tool instead of a thing we need to avoid at all costs.

Here are some hard hitting links regarding these rings, as well as various personal testimony from woman that have survived sexual abuse torture and trafficking and other horrid cruel things. This needs awareness. These links do not all pertain to International Pedophile rings but shine light and give context where need be. Feel free to copy this whole post if you wish and share it. No need to give credit.

I feel foolish now for not having seen this before, but the actions of my doctors during covid have shown that they are not advocates for patient health, but scared shills too afraid to go against the big pharma narrative.

Due to a couple pre-existing conditions, I goto multiple doctors - when I have brought up potential effects from the vaccines, they all immediately shut any discussion down - all refused to even talk about vaccine side effects, instead parroted the talking points about how wonderful the vaccines were.

When I brought up natural immunity as a reason not to get the vaccines (I already had covid), they again turned a blind eye.

I wasn't even asking for an exemption, merely bringing up concerns about potential problems based on my conditions.

I have heard rumors that the health insurance groups have been threatening to remove doctors that don't push the ""vaccine über alles"" mantra, and based on what I have seen, I believe it.

I have totally lost all respect for ""medical professionals"" that I thought were advocates for my well-being.

- From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were ""vaccinations.""

- Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were ""vitamin drinks"" that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta.

The boys were also given radioactive oatmeal in a study for Quaker Oats. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/americas-deep-dark-secret/

- The Imperial Japanese Army's notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html (http://archive.is/hojxN)

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

**Political:**

- Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.[3] This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White

- ""Between 1969 and 1973, the U.S. dropped half-a-million tons of bombs on Cambodia alone, killing at least 100,000 civilians. Given that Nixon had been elected on a promise to end the war in Vietnam, Kissinger believed that it wasn’t enough to place Menu in the category of 'top secret.' Absolute and total secrecy, especially from Congress, was a necessity. He had no doubt that Congress, crucial to the appropriation of funds needed to conduct specific military missions, would never approve a bombing campaign against a neutral country with which the United States wasn’t at war."" https://www.salon.com/2015/11/10/henry_kissingers_genocidal_legacy_partner/ (http://archive.is/4NMTE)

They obtained copies of speeches and other material from the Goldwater campaign and gave them to President Johnson so he could respond to the points made before he read his speeches. CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was in charge of the spying operation. Hunt later retired from the CIA in 1970 and was hired by the White House in 1972 to lead a unit known as the Plumbers that was dedicated to plugging leaks within the Nixon administration, playing dirty tricks on Nixon’s opponents and obtaining political intelligence. https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/22/cia-fbi-spy-presidential-campaign-trump-goldwater-218415

- On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

That officer believed there were “no limitations” on his activities, the report said, because he was on an unpaid leave of absence, and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A. Another embedded C.I.A. analyst — who was on its payroll — said he was given 'unfiltered' police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence, the C.I.A. report said."" https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/nyregion/cia-sees-concerns-on-ties-to-new-york-police.html (http://archive.is/yKwIa)

- Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf

- In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation.

The emergency act, the presence of the UN on Canadian soil, the freezing of funds, the violence directed towards those calling for freedom; all of these things loudly roar out to the world that Canada is not a democracy. It is a communist country run by a foreign dictator.

1. Stoned ape theory. Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense actually.

2. You can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don’t.

3. Mushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.

4. The best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn’t other fungus fight other bacteria’s and viruses? Well they do. People aren’t educated about them and fear them.

5. Mycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon. 

6. Even the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can’t hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.

7. Every breath you take has spores. These things are very significant…

8. In ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty commoners were punished for having them.

9. On the Joe Rogan show with Paul stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, “I can’t talk about this because I could get killed” 

10. The oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old….these things are incredibly evolved and don’t even need to have sex. You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.

11. I have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating these and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms, 

12. A lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms. 

13. There are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say

14. Maria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.

15. I fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill work well synonymously.

16. There are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?

17. There are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.

18. lion's mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. the 5000 year old mummified corpse Ötzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. it may have been used as medicine.

19.LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.

20. ergotamine is also used in a migraine medicine called cafergot. it was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but it still works for many people.

21. If you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it’s a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I’ve seen is that they love that shit.I have seen families of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colony’s build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows the nat flys love them.

22. The fact that they call the brain the “default mode network” when you become an adult and so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain is lit up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording “default mode network”

23. Cordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it solves the problem completely. 
I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are a symbiotic relationship when we eat them 🤷‍♂️ 

24. It is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here is it really safety?

25. Im saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I asked my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, “have I heard of it? Im a victim of it!” I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.

If life is a test I don’t think it’s a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.

Here's why it'll soon be much higher"". Such a figure, $100 billion, is a massive amount of money. Consider that some people kill others [over $5](https://www.local10.com/news/florida/man-killed-over-5-dollars). Imagine what some powerful people are capable of doing for $100 billion a year. Is giving people cancer deliberately to profit of them out of the question for some people? I think not. Specially if $100 billion is at stake. So I think that there is the possibility at least that people around the world, specially where chemos are sold, are being infected deliberately with cancer. 

Another issue is that we hear about research efforts to find the cures for cancers. But, what if said cures consist in a single dose of a pill that will cost $20? Does that make financial sense for the pharma companies involved? Why finding a cure, specially a cheap cure, if a single person can spend [$100,000 a year or more](http://fortune.com/2015/05/08/cancer-drug-spending-100-billion-in-2014-headed-higher/) in cancer treatment medication? This is what I think is a possibility, not stating it is happening, but is a possibility that may be happening: researchers trying to find a cure are being meticulously monitored and if one of them crosses an established threshold of advancement towards finding a cure, that researcher is either blackmailed, threatened or even killed to keep it quiet.

 I have no idea what are the numbers but I wonder if there have been cancer researchers who have been murdered, suicided, died in accidents, or died mysteriously. Which may not be a lot because I don't know how many researchers are there and how many of them would advance in their research enough. I sure hope I am wrong and big pharma really is trying to find a cure for the benefit of humanity, but sadly we live in such a world where many consider money is worth a life or even ten thousand.

On r/politics this week, any news story about Joe Biden and his vaccine mandate- upvoted! Any news story about the court's injunction against it- downvoted! Seriously, progressives that never even voted for him during the primaries are now okay with him acting like a king?

There's even an increasingly aggressive push to vaccinate children, even though we all knew very early on that children have near-zero risk. Suddenly, all the ""Science"" we learned in 2020 goes out the window because of the vaccine.  Today, you can't even ask a question like *""why don't the fully vaccinated get tested every week too, if they can also get Covid?""* without getting banned.

Hello! Some countries are starting to add Boosters to their vaccine mandates- your vaccination status *IS NOT PERMANENT*! CDC is already recommending boosters, Pfizer (who suddenly became Reddit's angel overnight) is trying to get another Emergency Authorization for its own Booster. If you got the one-shot J&J, you're basically already considered unvaccinated.

Seriously, even liberals and progressives- are you really okay with this? A ""freedom pass"" expires every 6-8 months- every single mainstream news article that talks about ""waning immunity"" always, always, always concludes with ""get a booster ASAP"".

Even if they are lucky enough to buy , the property taxes skyrocket and suddenly they can’t afford their payments, so technically they don’t “own” anything. They merely lease it from the government. 

That same government also wants to track every account with $600 or more. They want to tax your venmo transactions. They want to tax UNREALIZED GAINS. Do these people even understand what the fuck they’re talking about?? When’s the last time you had an intelligent conversation with a fucking 80 year old? Yet we keep “electing” them to run our country. 

Don’t get me wrong- I think the American dream did exist once upon a time, but those days are long gone and we are currently living in a dystopian nightmare. To make matters even worse, everyone seems to have taken the blue pill, and are perfectly fine with their reality. They’re fine with the 1st amendment being dismantled as more and more people are silenced for speaking out against the system. They even campaign for it. 


Humans are not meant to live like this. I cant help but feel depressed. What are my options? How can I get out of this nightmare. I just want a nice piece of land in the middle of nowhere and to be left the FUCK ALONE. I cant be the only one that thinks like this. Where the fuck is sanity",conspiracy,big pharma

In this post I will expose the reason on why this vaccine is being pushed so damn hard on us, to the point of getting ostracized of the system if you don't take it. 

Not about depopulation, or just giving more money to big Pharma. These are just side tabloid aspects of the real reason:

**Transhumanism. Connecting your body to the digital world.**

Yeah, this may sound crazy to a lot of you. You can stop reading here if you believe I am just a tin foil hat conspiracy nutjob. Its okay. Even I think this is some Black Mirror shit, but this is the truth, and I´ll approach it from ""official"" sources so there is no room left for doubt. 

I want to make myself clear that this is an unbiased post. I am not saying transhumanism is necessarily bad or that you are making a mistake by getting vaccinated. In fact, this is a revolutionary invention that could be used for lots of good things. Personally, I believe this transhumanist era puts beginning to a Huxleyian apocalypse, that's why I am not taking it. But it is up to you. I just want you to know what you are putting in your bodies

# 1.- Graphene 

You probably heard of people getting magnetized after their shots. Graphene oxide in the shots is not a mystery. \[it is even listed as the main component in Chinese vaccine patents\]( [https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112220919A/en)). 

Graphene is a fantastic invention. A material several times more conductive than copper and that can be of 1 atom of thickness.

\[These are the words from the inventor\]([https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate](https://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/357501/Graphene-will-help-in-Covid-fight-says-Nobel-Laureate)), Nobel prize winner Konstantin Novoselov, about the uses of graphene regarding this pandemic 

This is a full rabbit hole. Graphene is in everything. I am sure graphene is what Julian Assange called \[""The smart evil dust that is everywhere and in everything""\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTXWHDNW6Gc)). I suggest going down this rabbit hole to fully understand what is going on

Remember these vaccines are genetic technology? So, using graphene oxide as a carrier could mean maybe your DNA, your life blocks, are turning into electricity superconductors. Tiny little computers. Why?

&#x200B;

Just think about the possibilities. Turning your life blocks into tiny computers

# 2.- The Great Reset 

This is an agenda of the World Economic Forum. I believe what we are living now is a biological war, a planned pandemic. The virus was designed for the vaccines, not the other way, in order to begin the shift into the digital world. It makes sense, we needed a crisis and fear of the people to comply with a universal vaccine mandate.  There is soft evidence that show you this crisis has been planned. Of course I don't have a video of Fauci or Schwab or the CCP saying "" hehe, we are going to release this virus and make everyone comply"". At this point, you have to use common sense. If you are okay with this, lets keep going.

[I want to emphasize that connecting bodies and the digital world is something that the \\""elites\\"" have been talking about for a while.](https://preview.redd.it/xd80gvfqqao71.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=070f0a1405a05e56aa423dd96ade7aa2ddf7c5ff)

I suggest to you reading this article by the WEF. \[The Internet of Bodies\]([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/)).

Devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn? I´ll talk about this, but first, vax passes enter the game. If you live in a place where vax passes are active, you probably have to show a phone app QR code or the classic paper card.

 Ever heard of the \[Quantum dot tattoo?\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532118/)). You probably know the temperature scanners that are in every store entrance. Let me tell you by experience, these are bullshit, they don't work, they just throw random numbers. The function of these scanners is to prepare people when they actually have to scan their Quantum Dot Tattoo. I am talking about the future now, so I must stop to not lose credibility in my statements, I am just linking the dots of the ""Internet of Bodies"".

&#x200B;

The goal is to fuse your bodies to the digital world. We are in the vaccination stages and the beginning of vax passes.

**By Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Chairman, Children’s Health Defense**

APRIL 28, 2020

For many months I have remained silent in the face of defamatory and dishonest attacks against me by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai. My approach was to ignore the sniping to preserve the unity of the Health Freedom Movement. However, Shiva has expanded his malevolent campaign to include venomous salvos against our community’s most prominent and effective leaders, including Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Dr. Rashid Buttar, Polly Tommey and Samoan-Australian activist Taylor Winterstein. Because he now has some of our outstanding spokesmen in his gun-sites, and because his poisonous volleys have begun to damage the solidarity that is critical to our success, I reluctantly make this response.

**Little Lies / Big Lies**

I had never heard of Shiva when he approached me on the street following a January 6th, 2020 Trenton rally. We had a friendly chat and took a photo. [Afterward, he tweeted that I had refused to shake his hand.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Handshake-tweet-e1588101235385.jpg) [A half-dozen photos](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0706-scaled-e1588018251484.jpeg) of [us shaking hands](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7134-e1588101646604.jpg) soon surfaced, proving his statements false. It was only then that I learned he was running as a fringe candidate for U.S. Senate against my nephew, Massachusetts Congressman Joseph Kennedy. It is axiomatic that a man who lies about small things, will also lie about the large. I made a note to fact check Shiva’s assertions. I advise others to take similar precautions.

**Attacking Our Leaders**

Del Bigtree, Mark Blaxill, Polly Tommey and Dr. Rashid Buttar are battle proven veterans deeply scarred by incalculable personal sacrifices suffered on the front-line trenches during decades of hand to hand combat against Pharma, corrupt regulators and the medical cartel. They have published, litigated, campaigned, debated, testified, strategized, organized, informed, and defended. I am proud to have served with each of them in dozens of state capitals, speaking at rallies, testifying before state legislatures, and meeting with public officials. They have emptied their personal bank accounts and, at times, ruined their health in service to our cause. They have each played indispensable roles in building the institutions that have helped us coalesce into the coherent and powerful movement that now threatens the Pharmaceutical paradigm. They have given us every reason to trust them and no reason for doubt. Shiva’s claim that these individuals are “controlled opposition” are patently absurd.

**Undermining State Health Freedom Advocates**

Shiva has viciously attacked the brilliant Health Choice Massachusetts (HCM) organizer, Candice Edwards. Edwards and her HCM co-founder, Allison Chapman lead the battle to derail the repeal of vaccine exemptions in Boston. Shiva tried to sabotage the group’s efforts, by showing up at Legislature Hearings without the science panel he had promised and delivering self-promotional testimony so loaded with insulting vulgarity and invective, that the Public Health Committee shut down the hearing, calling Shiva “a prick.” [Shiva then picked a loud fight with one of the moms accusing her of using her child for political purposes.](https://youtu.be/XWO_anzCOp8) “He threw us under the bus,” Edwards recalls. Shiva accuses Edwards of being “controlled opposition.”

**When Shiva calls Movement leaders “controlled opposition,” is he speaking of himself?**

Instead of preaching science, Shiva spends money from his Health Freedom donor base digging up dirt on other activists. Shiva employs a full-time “Negative Research” investigator, Jennifer Bennett, to excavate and invent defamatory gossip about Health Freedom Groups and their leaders in Massachusetts and nationally. In his war against our Movement, Shiva employs all the classic strategies and gambits prescribed by psychological warfare experts, in our Intelligence Services, for disrupting social reform movements when they begin to gather steam and threaten the power of entrenched vested interests.

So why, beside malignant narcissism, would a newcomer to our Movement seek to undermine our most effective and influential leaders and divide our forces? I don’t like to speculate about people’s motives, but it is a common motif among a certain species of scoundrel to project their own villainy in their slandering of others. Do Shiva’s accusations that all of us are “controlled opposition” reveal his own motivations?

Some hints to that answer may lie among the things Shiva doesn’t tell us.

**Shiva, the Vaccine Maker**

Shiva never mentions the fact that he is a vaccine maker. Shiva owns a pharmaceutical company, [Cytosolve](https://cytosolve.com/pharmaceuticals/), that [partners with vaccine and drugmakers to accelerate FDA approvals for vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve2.jpeg). His principal [business partner](https://cytosolve.com/about-us/) is [Pfizer](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-27-20-at-5.57-PM.jpg), the world’s #4 vaccine maker. Are Shiva’s attacks on our Movement calculated pandering, to court affection from Pfizer and the HHS regulators––upon whose favor his financial success relies––and to win their blessings by discrediting a Movement that questions vaccine products?

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1961.jpeg

https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Cytosolve4.jpeg

**Shiva’s business model requires him to court favor with vaccine companies.**

**Shiva made his money from the Clintons**

Shiva claims to have invented Email ([Smithsonian](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/va-shivaayyadurai-inventor-of-e-mail-honored-by-smithsonian/2012/02/17/gIQA8gQhKR_story.html) says Shiva’s claim is untrue and a Federal court has agreed). In fact, Shiva made his fortune [running Email operations](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) for President Bill and Hillary Clinton during the White House years. (It is ironic, therefore, that he accuses others of consorting with the Clintons). The Clinton contract propelled his company, [EchoMail](https://echomail.com/about-us/), to a [$200 million](https://books.google.com/books?id=_DiCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368&lpg=PT368&dq=echomail+clinton&source=bl&ots=JiUpLPoovM&sig=ACfU3U3rQpkFAw5805rRPSVccjWn7aT6lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2joSXtProAhXBXM0KHVtJD3gQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=echomail%20clinton&f=false) [valuation.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-28-20-at-11.26-AM.jpg)

**Shiva, Partner to Microsoft**

Shiva’s [Echomail](https://echomail.com/about-us/) partner was [Bill Gates’ Microsoft](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588022140928.jpg). Even today, Shiva lists Microsoft as his partner on his EchoMail homepage. Gates, the world’s most prominent and vocal advocate for universal mandatory vaccination is also a proponent for tagging human beings with injected technologies for tracking vaccine records. Both Microsoft and Gates are leading industry efforts to develop a subdermal biometric chip system. Shiva’s success at dividing our movement and undermining and discrediting our leadership might ingratiate him with these business partners.

**Shiva and Bill Gates**

It is noteworthy that Shiva consistently mutes his criticism of [Bill Gates](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/01-03-Bill-Gates-with-Vaccine_Email-e1588022386170.jpg), seeking to deflect public anger at Gates towards Hillary Clinton. This makes no sense. Hillary’s views on mandatory vaccines are abhorrent, but unlike Gates whose ownership of the WHO and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance allows him to dictate global vaccine policy, Hillary is an out-of-work politician with no political power. The Clinton Foundation is virtually defunct and bootless as an arbiter of public health policy. Why does Shiva shield Gates and insist that Hillary is the more important target?

**Shiva and 5G**

Both Gates and Microsoft hold leading stakes in the burgeoning wireless infrastructure expansion. Gates’ subdermal chip systems will be capable of meshing with Gates’ extensive new 5G antennae and satellite deployments, to harvest, not only our vaccination and medical data, but also lucrative information about our movements, our purchases, and our desires, at the granular level. [Shiva lists his other business partners as the principle Big Data Titans](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-1.22-PM-e1588084452529.jpg), Dell, Oracle and IBM which all stand to make a killing on the current 5G expansion. Is this why Shiva refuses to condemn 5G?

**How Does Shiva Escape Censorship?**

Shiva is the only leader in our Movement [who doesn’t suffer the Social Media censorship that bedevils the rest of us](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Both-IG2.jpg). His capacity to boost his audience, his immunity from shadow-banning and from eviction from his platforms has allowed him to exponentially expand his base, as the rest of us struggle past the censors to reach our audiences, one follower at a time. Why are Facebook, Google, and Instagram showering love on Shiva while they strangle the rest of us? Why does Silicon Valley boost Shiva and smother us?

**Shilling for Silicon Valley Big Data Billionaires**

Shiva has previous experience shilling for Big Data/Telecom. In 2010, Shiva served as front man to PayPal’s Silicon Valley titan, Peter Thiel. Thiel was campaigning to destroy Gawker in revenge for its unflattering article about himself. Thiel funded Shiva to file a defamation law suit against Gawker for reporting that Shiva lied about inventing Email. Shiva, of course, lost the law suit, but the ruinous costs of the litigation helped bankrupt Gawker, which was always Thiel’s purpose. Shiva may have discovered, from that transaction, the economic opportunities in shilling for Silicon Valley’s Big Data Barrons.

Silicon Valley is deeply entrenched with the CIA and the Pentagon in cyber-warfare efforts and in developing AI surveillance systems that can compete with the Chinese. The Silicon Valley/CIA partnership has its own secretive Federal agency, the National Security Commission, chaired by ex Google CEO, Eric Schmidt. Their strategy is to roll out 5G as a comprehensive security and surveillance superstructure that will serve as a platform for new surveillance technologies. This sinister cabal undoubtedly see the evolving Health Freedom coalition between anti 5G and anti Pharma activists as an obstacle to their ambitions.

Why Does Shiva Want to Push Democrats Out of the Health Freedom Movement?
Shiva’s insistence that Democrats disown their party, before being welcomed into the Health Freedom Movement, and his attacks on anyone who ever voted for Hillary or any other prominent Democrat, seem deliberately calculated to foment destructive partisanship and to drive Democrats from our Movement. Shiva knows that for us to succeed, our Movement requires political diversity, unity, harmony and a big tent. We welcome citizens of every nation and every political stripe. We don’t impose ideological tests or check party affiliations. I, myself, am a lifelong Democrat, but I understand that this issue must transcend party affiliations. All of our best leaders comprehend that there is no such thing as a Republican child or a Democratic child. I have worked effectively and aggressively across the nation, with Republicans—[including President Trump](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-2.04-PM-e1588023232147.jpg). Trump, who himself donated $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, did not hold my previous support for Hillary against me. He welcomed the opportunity to burnish the project’s bipartisan bona fides.

Our bipartisan approach is effective, and frightening to Pharma. Is this why Shiva is trying so hard to excite political hatred among our followers, and to polarize us along party lines?

**Can Shiva Pass his Own Ideological Test?**

Shiva’s insistence on ideological purity is ironic at best and duplicitous and deceptive at worst, given his own ambiguous political theologies. To win the top spot on the G.O.P.’s U.S. Senate ballot, Shiva persuaded Massachusetts Republicans that he was a staunch, dyed-in-the-wool Right-wing Trump supporter. [Elsewhere, however,](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.43-PM-e1588024885644.jpg) [he brags of being a committed socialist and communist sympathizer.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-25-20-at-12.42-PM.jpg) His wavering affiliations beg the question: Who is Shiva, and does he stand for anything beyond personal opportunism?

**Psy-Ops Tactics**

Shiva does not litigate, publish or fund scientific research, build institutions, treat patients, or collaborate with other leaders. He has demonstrated no inclination to work with the rest of us to build a Movement, powerful enough to confront the Big Pharma and the Big Data/Telecom tyrants. He behaves, in every instance, like a man determined to tear down all that others have built up. People who still believe in Shiva might demand to know why he chooses to spare FDA, Pfizer, Microsoft, and 5G his barbs, and to direct his poison instead at our proven leaders. Shiva seems intent on distracting Del, Mark, Rashid, Polly, Taylor, Candice and others from their important work. His sinister, treacherous and destructive rear guard action, fomenting and feeding schism, division, discord, and confusion that harms our Movement, plays directly into the hands of Big Pharma.

Over 60 million people in the United States are currently on anti-depressants, but recent studies have shown that ""chemical imbalances"" in the brain have no correlation to depression/anxiety. This recent discovery makes you wonder what Big Pharma's exact motivations are besides stuffing their pockets with cash.

Hi. I've never been much of a conspiracy theorist, but after thinking about things that happened to me a few years ago, I think I may have nearly been taken advantage of by nefarious actions from the pharmaceutical  industry. I really want to get the word out, and find other people with similar experiences, and this sub seems like a good place to start.



I went to a very stereotypical high school, with all the standard cliques and shit you would expect. I was, and still am, not a very masculine person and because of this I didn't fit in. I was far more intrested in music, fashion, anime and film than sports or ""getting pussy"", which made me an outcast. As a result, I struggled with self esteem issues, and generally was confused and annoyed for most of this time. Then, when I was 17, I found something that made my life make sense: transgender forums. These websites told me that my feelings were classic transgender feelings, and that I needed treatment immediately. Over the next years I began the process of changing my gender. I saw a ""gender therapist, attending support groups, and even put myself on the waiting list for female hormones. Then, when I went to University, I got a wakeup call. There were loads of guys like me, who may not act like the ""manly man"" ideal, but still have no intention to change there gender. That's when I realized that I was going down a dark path, and quickly abanded the idea of me wanting to become a girl. 

During my year in the transgender world, I noticed some things that made me uncomfortable. The following is common retoric from support groups, forums and therapists.


**Everyone who feels confused is transgender**. If you make a single post on a transgender forum saying you think you might be trans, you will be validated in those feelings. No matter what the story, whether it's about enjoying ""female"" intrests, or something that sounds more like a sexual fetish than a legit medical condition, you are trans according to the user's.


**Any gender non-conforming is proof of trans status**. Like certain movies, music or TV? You are trans. Like wearing bright colored clothes? You are trans. Have more female than male friends? You are trans.


**You are trans, and don't trust anyone who says otherwise**. The most common complaint on these websites is that doctors are ""gatekeeping"" them. Anyone who doubts you in your feelings is evil, and you should lie and cheat your way into getting the treatment you ""need"".


**Asking questions is evil and dangerous""**. Trans people commit suicide all the time, and asking any questions about trans ideology just makes the problem worse. Accept what we say, or gtfo.


**If you are trans, you are amazing**. Trans people love boosting their own and each other's ego's. When you are a depressed teenager who doesn't fit in, this can be huge.

**So where's the conspiracy?** 


When someone takes the hormones they need for ""treatment"", they are prescribe to expensive medication for life, one that requires lots of medical attention. These people are cash cows for the medical industry. Unfortunately, there are not a lot actual transgender people in the world today. So why not make more? I think that big pharma is shilling forums and paying off doctors and therapists to convince people that they need these hormones.


The average trans person, when discussing there time before transition, fits a simple mold. An awkward nerdy teenager who doesn't act like a stereotypical manly guy and doesn't fit in with jocks and ""tough guys"". However, that description probably describes a large portion of the population. That's where the medical company's take advantage of people. By convincing competely normal and healthy people that the need help during a low point in their lives. High school sucks for people like me, but once you leave it gets better. University and the real world isn't high school. But pharmaceutical companies are convincing people that the problem isn't that high school sucks, but instead they are suffering from a serious medical problem, and they need treatment now.

What are your thoughts on my theory? Do I have a point, or am I just rambling?

106,"If you see the lies and evil of this world and feel like you don't belong, it's because you are not of this world.",905.0,tc1m49,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/tc1m49/if_you_see_the_lies_and_evil_of_this_world_and/,203.0,1647036979.0,"During COVID, plenty of users on this subreddit questioned why others could not see or accept the obvious lies regarding COVID, lockdowns, and vaccines. 

You, brothers and sisters, are not of this world. No, you're no green space aliens from a planet far, far away. 

You're the ambassadors in bondage. You are the warriors of men. You are the confessors of truth. You are witnesses to the evil. You are the light that will overcome the evil of our time. 

Why do we suffer? Because we can handle it. Our suffering provides us with the capacity to experience empathy. Our suffering allows us to understand how to help others. It shows us what matters in the world and who loves us. 

Those ""friends"" and family members who wouldn't invite you to Christmas dinner because you weren't vaccinated don't love you. 

That boss who fired you over a vaccine never cared about your well-being. No amount of money will change the dangers of surrounding yourself with people who will destroy your life to keep up with a social media trend or ingratiate themsleves with politicians. 

Those big pharma executives demanding you consume their product aren't trying to protect your health.

The government spending $1 billion on vaccine ads and ""positive coverage"" means they think you're an idiot who does what people on the screens tell you to do. 

And all of this undoubtedly caused suffering among those who have fought against the mandates and lockdowns. That suffering is a gift. 

Because you are not citizens of a country, but rather citizens of the Kingdom of God, you never truly fit in. Your values clash with modernism. You care more about the right thing more than being right. You recognize evil and can't help but to fight against it. 

You have an intolerance for lies and deception. And for unnecessary human suffering. You hate evil, hypocrisy, and liars. And at times, you even hate the world. You do the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing. You are willing to suffer for the truth. You are willing to be outcasts because you're incapable of endorsing lies. 

The west is ruled by the spirit of nihilism. Which is why acknowledging the truth is so dangerous to rulers of this world. The rulers of this world built an empire of lies because the simplest of truths would destroy it. Ergo, mass censorship and control over ideas, thoughts, and freedom of expression are the Great Wall to defend The Empire of Lies. 

This is no easy fight. But, brothers and sisters, so many of you have resisted the lies and have fought for the truth. You have refused to comply. Maybe because you had a gut feeling and chose to listen to that instead of the liars on screens. 

And so many who have been tricked have brought visibility to it, especially the vaccinated who have stood side by side the ""antivaxxer"" at protests and convoys. And for the vaccine injured who continue to fight for justice and full disclosure. 

We have all been tricked and deceived, which allows us to understand how easy it is to be lied to and believe a lie is the truth. 

If don't you don't feel like you belong, it's not a bad thing. How can it be a bad thing to hate an evil world and feel out of place in it? 

For those who feel alone and isolated, never believe for a moment you don't have brothers and sisters who love you. You are not weak. For weak people willingly barter their rights for temporary benefits. Weak people promote the lie because it's popular, while strong people repudiate the lies even if it causes suffering. 

Strong people remain committed to their values, ethics, and morals, even when facing persecution. Strong people are willing to sacrifice material possessions for an intangible idea. 

The only way to conquer evil is through love. This world got evil because we all fell short in loving each other. We divided ourselves by ideology and physical appearance. These walls we ourselves allowed to be erected need deconstructed. 

If we had loved each other properly, evil people would not be in power and destroying our world. Those who can not love can not be trusted to make ethical decisions. And that is our fault. But we have the power to fix this. We have the power to avoid making the same genocidal mistakes of past generations. Let us make love the highest virtue and do everything we can to manifest and empower the spirit of love. 

You don't belong because you were chosen. You are the best of mankind because you are standing against the greatest evil this world has faced. You matter. You're loved. And you're doing more for the world than you likely can see right now. There will be shills and trolls trying to demoralize you. But know your efforts are seen and acknowledged. Every time you refuse to participate in lies, you are saving people. 

If you feel demoralized, know that you possess the most powerful weapon: love. No matter how evil the world is, never forget love can change everything. An act of love can be smiling at a stranger or feeding a homeless person. It can be hugging someone who is having a bad day or shoveling your neighbors sidewalk. 

Rome wasn't built in a day, and nor will an empire of love. But never forget environments are a product of the people. You control your environment. And you can choose to empower it with love or evil. 

You are loved. You matter. You are not alone.",conspiracy,big pharma

114,The biggest conspiracy of all is the mushroom conspiracy (repost),833.0,oewu2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/oewu2m/the_biggest_conspiracy_of_all_is_the_mushroom/,213.0,1625584135.0,"The biggest conspiracy of all is the mushroom conspiracy

Here’s why:
1. Stoned ape theory. Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense actually.

2. You can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don’t.

3. Mushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.

4. The best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn’t other fungus fight other bacteria’s and viruses? Well they do. People aren’t educated about them and fear them.

5. Mycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon. 

6. Even the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can’t hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.

7. Every breath you take has spores. These things are very significant…

8. In ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty commoners were punished for having them.

9. On the Joe Rogan show with Paul stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, “I can’t talk about this because I could get killed” 

10. The oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old….these things are incredibly evolved and don’t even need to have sex. You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.

11. I have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating these and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms, 

12. A lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms. 

13. There are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say

14. Maria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.

15. I fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill work well synonymously.

16. There are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?

17. There are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.

18. lion's mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. the 5000 year old mummified corpse Ötzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. it may have been used as medicine.

19.LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.

20. ergotamine is also used in a migraine medicine called cafergot. it was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but it still works for many people.

21. If you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it’s a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I’ve seen is that they love that shit.I have seen families of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colony’s build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows the nat flys love them.

22. The fact that they call the brain the “default mode network” when you become an adult and so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain is lit up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording “default mode network”

23. Cordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it solves the problem completely. 
I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are a symbiotic relationship when we eat them 🤷‍♂️ 

24. It is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here is it really safety?

25. Im saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I asked my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, “have I heard of it? Im a victim of it!” I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.

26. Mushrooms differ from other drugs because you can’t live on other drugs. Mushrooms will make you feel healthy while most other drugs besides weed I would say are self destructive. What other drug can you call food? Jamaica is the only country it is legal to grow psychedelic mushrooms as food.

If life is a test I don’t think it’s a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.

130,India —- 241 MILLION People Declared COVID-Free After Government Promotes Ivermectin,761.0,pr8kn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pr8kn5/india_241_million_people_declared_covidfree_after/,118.0,1632060375.0,"—-Population 2/3 that of the U.S. completely free of COVID despite having low vaccination rate of 5.8%.

—-America's vaccination rate at 54% but cases still rising and restrictions still imposed.

The state of Uttar Pradesh in India, which has the equivalent of two-thirds of the United States population, has been declared COVID-free, the state government announced last week.

There are no more active cases of coronavirus in the 33 districts of Uttar Pradesh, which has a population of 241 million people.


“Overall, the state has a total of 199 active cases, while the positivity rate came down to less than 0.01 per cent. The recovery rate, meanwhile, has improved to 98.7 per cent,” Hindustan Times reported.

How is it that Uttar Pradesh has fully recovered from COVID despite the fact that only 5.8% of its population has been fully vaccinated, compared to the USA that has 54% fully vaccinated?

The answer is likely because of the government’s early use and distribution of ivermectin to its citizens.

From the Indian Express:

“Uttar Pradesh was the first state in the country to introduce large-scale prophylactic and therapeutic use of Ivermectin. In May-June 2020, a team at Agra, led by Dr. Anshul Pareek, administered Ivermectin to all RRT team members in the district on an experimental basis. It was observed that none of them developed Covid-19 despite being in daily contact with patients who had tested positive for the virus,” Uttar Pradesh State Surveillance Officer Vikssendu Agrawal said.

He added that based on the findings from Agra, the state government sanctioned the use of Ivermectin as a prophylactic for all the contacts of Covid patients and later cleared the administration of therapeutic doses for the treatment of such patients.

Claiming that timely introduction of Ivermectin since the first wave has helped the state maintain a relatively low positivity rate despite its high population density, he said, “Despite being the state with the largest population base and a high population density, we have maintained a relatively low positivity rate and cases per million of population.”

He said that apart from aggressive contact tracing and surveillance, the lower positivity and fatality rates may be attributed to the large-scale use of Ivermectin use in the state, adding that the drug has recently been introduced in the National Protocol for Covid treatment and management. “Once the second wave subsides, we would conduct our own study as there has been an emerging body of evidence to substantiate our timely use of Ivermectin from the first wave itself,” Vikasendu told The Indian Express.”

One would think the World Health Organization, Big Pharma, the mainstream media, and Dr. Anthony Fauci would be overjoyed by this development that ivermectin is undoubtedly saving lives.

They see what the media shows them: murders, rape, violent crimes, hate crimes, ect. They go to work and talk to their coworkers about the recent school shooting or converse with their friends about the guy from their hometown who just got caught for murder. They talk about how tragic it is or how terrible of a person the guy who murdered his wife was. They go on FB and make post saying ""Prayers for X school students, how could something so evil ever happen?"" Or when news breaks that some parents were pimping out there young children for dope money, it's ""OMG people are so sick!!"" 

But that's where it ends. Only small town Billy who's addicted to crack is capable of selling his child to traffickers. Or Jeff the janitor who got pissed off at the world so he shot up his workplace is the only one capable of commiting such an atrocity.

They disregard it as a conspiracy, or minimize the scope of it. ""It was *just* Epstein and Maxwell. Surely the powerful business exec who frequently travelled to his buddy's sex dungeon of an island had no idea what was going on. Surely the President,  CEO, or Royal Family member had no idea that the women his buddy surrounded himself with were underage or being held against their will. Surely Mr. Billionaire is 100% ethical and would never be involved in such a thing even though Mr. Billionaire's company has been exposed for using child labor or took place in illegal price fixing in the past. Only small town Billy would be involved in such a thing, no way a well known and successful celebrity would ever do something so sinister.

They forget that big pharma got an entire generation of Americans hooked on opiates just so they could pad their pockets. They forget that the CIA funnelled drugs and guns to black communities or purposely poisoned POC for a little science experiment. They forget that the govt lied about Saddam having WMDs or that their govt has been staging coups worldwide since before they were even born.

Why don't you pro-vaxxers just accept the reality that vaccines were a NOTHING BURGER that LITERALLY NOBODY outside of old geezers, sick wheezers, expectant mothers, and a few pharmacists were concerned with.

Vaccination was NEVER a hot button issue, vaccines were ALWAYS a CHOICE nobody judged you for. Absolutely NOBODY cared if you got vaccinated because everyone just smiled and kept it moving. A conversation about vaccines seldom lasted maybe 30 seconds because the PERSON YOU WERE SPEAKING TO got freaked out and left when you brought up private medical information. This **wasn't a casual conversation** folks, it was taboo to even discuss out in the open before the scream-demic.

But lets start with the the average American according to the CDC 42.4% of adults are obese in the united states([https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)). They than go on to say all the major problems from obesity such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart problems, covid and strokes. Interestingly enough the next sentence is about the massive medial cost of obesity (147 billion in 2008). 

 

Yet, we don't see the goverment spending billions and billions of dollars to fight obesity. Imagine if instead of running mass vaccination centers we ran mass fitness centers to teach American a healthy lifestyle. (and yes those who want their shots can have them) We should consider that one of the larges comorbidity to covid is obesity.  

&#x200B;

Lets take a look next at fast food. While I believe that they can do whatever they want since we are a capitalist society, people also have the right not to eat their all the time. According to Statista, the GDP of Quick serve in the us was 296 billion dollars. That means that it is an average of almost 900 dollars per person for 330 million Americans. ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174417/fast-food-restaurants-industry-market-size-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174417/fast-food-restaurants-industry-market-size-us/)). This is very alarming, I would say that this means that 100 meals per year come form fast food. 

&#x200B;

The soft drink and snack industry is in the sane boat, they are essentially selling sugar marked at children to get them hooked young. Thus, creating life long customers. We could at least encourage diet soda options. I know so many people that drink a 32 oz soda every day or even more and see nothing wrong with it. 

&#x200B;

Fast food is ok in moderation, same with soda but can not become an every day thing. We should not pretend like its ok to eat like this every day. I was not even allowed soda as a kid, however we did get a lot of fast food. That has been one habit that was hard to break, I still get fast food from time to time but spring for higher end options like chipotlet when I can. I admittedly put on weight over the covid and fell into the unhealthy trap some but am crawling out. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately for many Americans, they never craw out continue to eat very badly and die young. They play video games all day and never leave the house to actually exercise, participation is sports among youths is dropping drastically. Their are no doubt psychological reasons behind this as well, but the whole fat acceptance thing certainly does not help. Who constructs a movement to encourage a terribly unhealthy lifestyle in the name of ""acceptance."" That is what is so baffling to me, and why I believe this movement was deliberately constructed to protect the interests, of these company, not peoples feelings, over the health of people.

Anyone speaking up for these people are part of huge astroturfing campaigns. If you compare Trump's social media numbers and Biden's, it is very, very clear Trump is far, far more popular. It isn't even a contest, as Biden's numbers are minuscule in comparison.

Why are there multiple documents like this?

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf

Astroturfers will come in and complain about Trump supporters but they fail to understand that people weren't supporting Trump as much as they were supporting the idea that pedophiles might finally start getting arrested.

Arrest. Prosecute. Execute.

That is the appropriate solution for child sex traffickers.

That is the appropriate solution for Ghislaine Maxwell. 

That is the appropriate solution for Keith Rainier (who bundled votes for Hillary, btw).

Pedophile rings exist at the benevolence of corrupt politicians, priests and corporations.

Striking at the heart of pedophile rings is to strike at the heart of corruption. 

You shills can complain about Trump and racism and politics all you want, but we all know it is a distraction so to protect the child sex traffickers and that is why you all belong in jail, too.

The shills who work with Reddit admin to politically astroturf and suppress legitimate evidence are participating in a massive game to run forensic interruption operations so that human traffickers can continue their trade unimpeded. The closer we get to prosecuting them, the more they will take away our rights.

The Great Conspiracy is not that hard to understand. It is about gradually asserting authoritarianism until the corporate totalitarian state can keep every drop of proceeds for your labor and decide how you spend every dollar and your identity can only be from a predetermined set of corporate slave identities that will all have their own shade of mental illness so that big pharma can continue to engineer your bodies and minds.

More than corruption is happening. Your agency is being stolen and the UniParty MultiCult is laughing in your face. They are sending shills to laugh in your face. Hunter Biden had a Reddit account and the first thing he did was go shill against Pizzagate. They are straight up coming here and laughing in your face because they still get to f*** little kids and God knows what else.

Shout out to http://www.endthebacklog.org/. If you are, at all, interested in justice, and you want to actually do something. Call your leaders in your local jurisdictions to inquire about and apply pressure to get back logged sexual assault examination kits tested.

Every time they do a huge chunk, multiple serial rapists are caught. Detroit had huge success.

End the kit backlog is another way to target a lot of corruption with the smallest amount of effort. Everyone who stands against the testing of rape examination kits is a problem.

Kamala Harris and her secret police WANT SERIAL RAPISTS ON YOUR STREETS. San Diego has been harboring an atrocious backlog despite money being available. 

Retard excuses are presented like, ""they don't have investigative value."" So what. We all agreed and paid to test the damn kits. Don't give us any more excuses.

Trump is irrelevant. The issue of racism is irrelevant. If you want to fix society, you will target corrupt politicians.

If corruption is addressed through transparency and accountability, our society will enter a Golden Age. It is literally the last hurdle. Anyone telling you to fight each other instead of fight child sex traffickers is 1) a psychopath 2) a terrible person 3) deserves to be named and shamed.

THAT is what over reaching spy powers be for. Corrupt politicians and child sex traffickers. Our spy apparatus is not catching anyone except political opponents. Anyone who supports the current administration is complicit in aiding a corporate totalitarian state (at one of their critical turning points in their ability to manipulate stupid people) and everyone should be made aware.

And, ultimately, even if you, as an individual don't have much of a political will, at least be kind to each other. Abuse only creates more abusers and that is really the heart of society's problems. Abusive people are in control of your government and people are about to come here and pretend they are amazing and that I am the crazy person for wanting to see child sex traffickers arrested, prosecuted and executed.",conspiracy,big pharma

This sub looks like what the front page of reddit looked like for the first 3 years of its existence. It was about exposing things, the real truth, and learning about the world. This is what Aaron Schwartz wanted, before they killed him and killed reddit. 

All the uncomfortable truths are delegated to this ridiculous-sounding ""/r/conspiracy"" which drives people away who are on the fence. These things that are often talked about on this sub _are_ conspiracies, but they're also news, they're speculation or facts about how the world actually works beyond the face of things as we see them. This label of ""conspiracy"" is a form of censorship in itself, it pushes all the big deal stories to this one small corner of reddit. 

If you're newer to reddit, 4 years or less, I bet there was one day when you found this sub. I bet you went through the frontpage of this sub and couldn't believe what you were reading. You probably thought ""Why aren't these things being discussed on the news subreddit or the politics subreddit, if they are true?"" You may have looked in to a specific story or two, and started realizing that there is something to many of the things talked about here. So you subscribed to the sub, you started reading it regularly. Maybe you decided you don't care about this divisive label of ""conspiracy theorist"", that it means nothing to you. What idiot would be afraid of theorizing about potential conspiracies, given the endless [lists of historical examples?](http://www.blacklistednews.com/53_Admitted_False_Flag_Attacks/43969/0/38/38/Y/M.html) What kind of sheep is so trained to be afraid of the truth that they run away from it thinking they're doing themselves a favor? You start to question things in a deeper way once the tricks of culture become more obvious.

Obviously not everything in this sub is true, far from it. But there are some startling facts that have been presented over and over and have basically been proven to be true. Things like the actions of the intelligence agencies in overthrowing and controlling governments of foreign countries. The funding and support of ISIS by the US and Israel, via Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The fact the BRICS banks and the IMF/World Bank are run by overlapping groups of people. The fact central banks and corporations have far too much control over government, wresting control of it away from the people. The US-Israel connection of funding and arms and police training. The connection of Greater Israel with Zionism and the six-day war. The drug trade from Afghanistan, where 90% of the worlds poppies are grown, for US pharma and illegal drug trade profits. The drug wars caused by the US in Central and South America, for profit. The way the biggest oil companies have infiltrated the governments of the world for their own profit. The demolition of Building 7. Regulatory capture. Compartmentalization. Divide and conquer.

These things are very real. These things matter, and drive current events. They are generally provable to be true. They are ""open secrets."" 

This is the difference between the MSM (including the front pages and main subreddits of reddit) versus places like this subreddit that actually care about the truth, is that they will actually _look in to_ those open secrets. They will expose certain interesting tidbits that are selectively ignored by the corporate media. 

Once you start to realize this is the case, and that _really_ sinks in, then if you're anything like me you experienced a psychological trip of sorts where you realized how bullshit many aspects of our society really are. That deep down advertising is actually predatory and evil, it's not that people just say that as a funny cliche. That there really are a bunch of psychopaths with no morality or compassion in many many positions of power, because those are generally the only people with the motivation and willpower to go to the terrible depths necessary to acquire a billion dollars or a high political position. They will sacrifice anything for it, including their morality and the lives of others. They have no problem sleeping at night. 

You see the ideologies people believe in, like Christianity, or nationalism/patriotism, or sports, or even scientism (belief in the findings of the scientific establishment above scientific theory itself). You see the greed, people borrowing and spending their lives away, trying to get some sort of emotional perk out of it to make up for the hours of drudgery they had to put themselves through to get the money in the first place. People trapped in cycles, in bad patterns that merely reinforce how fucked we are as a society. You see the denial, you see people shut down when you try to talk about the edges of what they think's ""allowed"" to talk about. You see people safeguarding their emotions beyond what's reasonable, beyond facts themselves. 

After a while, it crushes you to see it too openly, how many people fall for the bullshit. Everything is so messed up. It's practically unbelievable. If you were like me, you are probably _still_ in some stage of disbelief at certain aspects of reality even though they are provably true. Cognitive dissonance is something we all suffer from after living in this bizarre culture, the only difference is some of us try to rectify it and others just essentially distract themselves until they die. 

This is serious business. These topics strike at the heart of what we think about society, how we think we should treat each other, and what we think of ourselves. What we should be honest about, and what we should hide. What we consider important, and what we consider frivolous. 

We here are lucky to have the emotional motivation to seek out true important information, even if it is uncomfortable to digest. Others are not so lucky and hide from the truth out of fear, generally fear of losing social standing or losing income. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. You cannot save the willfully ignorant, they must save themselves. All you can do is actively make important information available to those who have not been exposed to it yet. There are many thirsty people out there who simply can't find water, so to speak. If you're ""in the know"", it's your job to share this information with others so that we can see our world and our human behavior more clearly. This is the information that our culture, media, and schools deliberately ignore despite being true. Once we can clearly see what we as humans _are actually doing_, then we can start to make adjustments and modifications to it that will have an impact. Otherwise we are just shouting at mirages and illusions. 

Did you know that 40,000 people worked on the atomic bombs that blew up Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but only a few hundred of them actually knew what they were making? This is the power of compartmentalization. Everyone makes their little part, and only certain people have the knowledge to see how all the parts come together. Those people are playing the rest, in a sense. Human society is like this in a way, we are all ""making our piece"" and the pieces come together in ways many of us don't anticipate that profit a very few, like a war or bank bailouts. We each only see our little world, our motivations and fears in our daily lives. We react correspondingly to the avalanche as best we can. Few question where those motivations and fears came from in the first place, and fewer question if they're even necessary at all. 

We program ourselves like a computer, our actions in the present create the conditions that allow the future to occur. ""Be the change you want to see in the world"" as Gandhi said. But also be the change you want to see in yourself. You can do it, you've been doing it your whole life. Just take their reigns of your own mind for yourself. Take off the training wheels of mainstream culture. It is not your friend, it is there to control you. To put your motivations and fears in to little pre-defined boxes that serve the corporate and governmental machinery, all through your TV or internet connection. 5 corporations own 95% of American all media, from TV to movies to magazines. And it just keeps getting more propagandistic and consolidated, week after week.

I started out with a teaspoon of Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth in 4oz of water at night and after a week I was up to a tablespoon at night and now I’m up to 1 tablespoon in the morning and 1 tablespoon at night. 

The benefits you could see are pretty amazing and it’s a shame that I’ve only learned about doing this in my 40’s. 

These are my benefits so far: 

**-	I sleep like a baby at night. I used to wake up around 1am to pee and then I was unable to go back to sleep, now, if I do wake up to pee, I fall right back asleep. I feel rejuvenated in the mornings where I used to be dead tired. **

**-	My complexion is looking very good. I had dark circles and bags under my eyes and they would be puffy all the time - now they look healthy (could also be attributed to more sleep at night). **

 -	**Headaches were a common thing with me - haven’t had one for the past 2 months. ****


**-	I used to be scatterbrained and have brain fog all the time - I can think straight and my mind isn’t going a mile a minute. **

**-	My toenails used to look dark - now they’re clear/white and looking good. **
   
-	My fingernails are healthy looking as well. 

**-	My hair on my head and all over my body is growing back. I have male pattern baldness and alopecia but now it’s all starting to clear up and my hair is growing. I’m going to have a full head of hair in the next few months 😳😳**

Before: 
https://i.imgur.com/7gy3YuR.jpg

Now:
https://i.imgur.com/SqweSLQ.jpg (you can see the hair and follicles growing in) 

 -	I used to get random cramps in my stomach - gone. 

 -	Random pangs in my chest - gone. 
-	Random eye/finger twitching - gone 

 - 	Resting heart rate - down. (Apple Watch measurement)

-Heart rate variability - up. (Apple Watch measurement)

Look - if you are not feeling your best and have random shit going on with your body and aren’t able to sleep and just feel like shit, give a look into a parasite cleanse. Like holy shit. 

There are many different types of cleanses but I feel for me, using Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth works and is cheap and available at Walmart and Home Improvement stores (must be Food Grade). 

You tried big pharma - now try natural products and see how you feel. 

I am not a doctor or scientist or anything like that - just your average 40something year old who likes to spread good information and help people as much as possible and I truly believe many, many people would benefit from a parasite cleanse but again, do your own research!!",conspiracy,big pharma

However, sadly it won't, as the stranglehold of Big Pharma on the Mockingbird MSM and the *entire* Washington DC establishment is unprecedented.

Watch how the vaccine apologists will now shift the goalposts with absurd statements like ""OK fine, vaccines can cause autism but MUH POLIO!""

I also think that this virus, whether leaked from a lab or not, is dangerous, but only to unhealthy, compromised and old people, and that the vast majority of the population do not need this vaccine, and by forcing it on everyone they are killing and maiming healthy people, all in the name of money and control.

For some reason the American, Australian, French and Canadian governments (to name a few) seems to be ignoring this and continue to increase the fear and control. (as a side note I dont like my government either, but for some reason they are actually doing the right thing at the moment.)

This is largely anecdotal but should be relevant to many people. This post is primarily about the public school system. By the way, I am all for **education;** education is crucial and can teach you to think critically as is much lacking in this ""pandemic"".

For context, I'm a university student studying electrical engineering. This year was my second year of the degree and through it, I came to realize just how useless school is in terms of education even for people like me.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the biggest scams of the century is school. As with Big Pharma, corrupt governments, corrupt corporations and the ""pandemic"", it has served to benefit only the elites. Being a one-size-fits-all model, almost all students are disadvantaged somewhat through school. Through the often gargantuan amounts of homework to the emphasis on grades, the overall health of students is severely impacted. Without school, children could be much more free to do what they want and have better quality of life.

School is a scam and benefits literally no-one but the elites. It's ridiculous how you have to spend almost your whole life in school until you are 17/18 years old. And guess what, once you graduate school, too bad, you're an adult now so you didn't even get to really enjoy your childhood. (Not saying that people can't have a good childhood due to school; just that school likely hinders our childhood.)

From primary school all the way to the end of secondary school, we are trained to conform with society. We are taught to follow rules and have to wear school uniforms (in the vast majority of schools at least). School is a one-size-fits-all model, everyone is trained in the same manner regardless of their differences. Obviously, everyone is different so this system already is flawed.

Prince EA on school: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8&t=13s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8&t=13s)

School was designed for training people to be factory workers, hence why they are trained to be the same and to follow rules. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE)

Children have to take the same classes for the most part despite their differences, leaving those who are actually good at and/or interested in those subjects to do well and those that are not to do poorly. The latter, though they may excel in other areas, are made to feel useless and like a failure. Heck, I remember how in school, I watched the top students get awards in prizegiving and how deflated I felt.

The focus on grades plays a large part in making school detrimental to many people's mental health. That feeling when your classmates get a higher grade than you...that feeling when you get a bad grade and you're scared to tell your parents because they might punish you for it (I have been many times). It's awful when you get compared to others on the basis of grades. **Why the fuck do we care so much about grades, a number or letter which represents how well you did on a test?** It literally has little to no impact on our future yet many people are so indoctrinated that they treat it like the most important thing ever. Being at university now, even the first two years of university grades have negligible impact on my future let alone school grades.

Perfect grades don't matter: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShfEMy8UZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShfEMy8UZQ)

Personally, I had to take compulsory classes in English, math, and science all the way until my second last year of high school (16 years old) where I could at least choose *some* of my classes. Man, I hated English so much; we had to read books and write essays on those books and I always sucked at it. I remember my teacher saying that we will need to write essays in university which is why we are doing it in high school. Well, I haven't needed those essay writing skills. If I did need them, I could learn them once I need them; why do I have to learn it years in advance. Furthermore, unless you are studying some (arguably useless) degree like English, you won't have to write essays on novels anyway. This brings me to my next point.

The public education system is geared towards people who want to go to university/college, primary those in STEM. This traps people who are not intending to go to university and/or not going into STEM to waste their entire childhood learning things they do not need. On the other hand, (secondary) school grants entrance for people who do, especially those going into STEM, to university. It is evident how the former group are disadvantaged, though I would argue that the latter are *also.*

Let me elaborate. To get into engineering, I had to pass everything in calculus and physics as well as get a high enough grade to get in. However, this is the only way school has benefitted me in my journey to being an engineer. Literally everything of value that I learnt has been through Youtube and university.

In school, it's basically just rote learning; we don't actually get taught the fundamental concepts. And then to study for exams, most (including me at the time) just grinded past exam papers. Oh yea, and then we all forget everything after the exam/test. The most pronounced example of this was when throughout the entirety of high school physics, we never even touched calculus which is the *language of physics.* Instead, we were just spoon-fed formulae. University taught me the physics and math I needed rigorously from the ground up anyway, rendering the time in school essentially useless. It's hilarious and depressing how I was learning a lot of the stuff in my last year of high school physics this year in university except I actually learnt it properly rather than regurgitating arbitrary formulae.

One thing I have experienced is how school literally teaches stuff at a snails pace. Most of the class time is just spent doing text book questions and the content of one year overlaps with the next. University could likely cover the entire content of science and math in the entirety of school (primary to secondary) in a single year. Honestly, it's such a waste of time. Even with this pace of teaching however, many students are struggling due to not having mastered previous concepts, mainly the fundamental concepts (which they likely don't teach anyway). These gaps in knowledge cause them to struggle more and more as time goes on since new concepts rely on previous concepts at least for STEM subjects. School doesn't care though; as long as you keep passing which is generally quite easy to do even with large gaps in knowledge, you progress to the next year with these gaps. According to Sal Khan, we must teach for mastery rather than test scores: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA&t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA&t=31s)

Now let's talk about a really important topic: **homework.** I have been fortunate to have gone to schools where little to no homework was given. However, there are many schools which give hours of homework a day. I actually applied to some of those schools in my city but was thankfully rejected. Homework is not the best method for learning by a long shot; it may actually be detrimental to learning. (Just google ""homework has no benefit"") There are two reasons which follow.

When you have to do homework for the sake of doing it, the focus shifts from learning to the completion of the task. This may also kill motivation for learning and make you hate the subject. On the other hand, when you learn for the sake of learning (i.e. not being assigned the task but voluntarily doing it), you will learn better as your focus is on the learning. This phenomenon is also why school kills students' motivation and makes them hate subjects they otherwise liked. It has certainly happened to me as I always find more motivation and eagerness to learn in school holidays. I always hated biology in school but I find it very interesting now that I am out of school.

The second reason is that most homework is just repetition of some problem (e.g. arithmetic). Once you do a few of the problems, you should be good with the concept except you might still need to do hundreds more for homework. Furthermore, it is the *understanding* of the concepts that are important. If you have the understanding, you can do any questions they throw at you. A prime example is how I got A+ in my electromagnetics exam this year (almost) without doing a single problem; all I did was develop my understanding of the concepts.

Imagine the things children could do if they weren't confined to school for their entire childhoods. Children could actually do what they liked rather than learning about some random history fact which they don't care about in school. They could be freed from the anxiety and depression resulting from school. They could learn more because they aren't restricted by the confines of school and grades. Heck, they could even go to university much sooner if they wanted.

Unfortunately, all the points I made are so because the **purpose of school is not to educate.** It is to make people sheep who don't question anything and kills creativity. Without school, there will be more free-thinkers and critical-thinkers, making it much harder for the elite to deceive so many as in this 'pandemic'. Upon graduation from secondary school, the vast majority (not all) will either just get a 9-5 job or go to university. The latter is likely followed by a (hopefully) better job, albeit with student loans to pay most likely. Either way, you're destined to serve the elites (especially through taxes which are a scam in itself) your whole life.

In conclusion, school has numerous flaws when it comes to actually educating children. It serves little to no benefit and is unnecessarily time consuming and stressful in terms of education. If school was abolished, society as a whole would be better off as people would be healthier and less indoctrinated.

These folks have been swallowed by hatred, fear and cognitive dissonance. It's depressing and terrifying.

What we're seeing is the culmination of decades of propaganda meant to create an unquestioning slave class through medical tyranny.

What we're seeing is the Endless War Machine slowly relinquishing its position as the great evil to the Pharmaceutical Mafia, which is now the means to which these criminals can get their quota of sacrificial lambs.

FTR, I never was *remotely* interested in the subject of vaccines when I began my personal journey down the rabbit hole.

It was only when I saw the ignorance and vitriol emanating from the narrative swallowers regarding the subject of vaccine that it started to pique my interest.

Whenever someone tells you ""the science is settled"" and not to do your own research, that's when you know you've found something vital that requires further investigation.

It couldn't be more clear that unquestioning obedience to our vaccine overlords is a key ingredient in the implementation of the New World Order. It's why these corrupt interests have attempted to stifle any discourse on this subject, and why it can elicit such an emotional and visceral response from individuals who are still asleep.

In the early days of reddit, the shilling for the MIC, big pharma, and companies like Monsanto was rampant. I remember realizing that certain topics would bring them out of the woodwork like rats, and they would harass and attack folks like me with impunity.

It became clear that I could discover which were the ""controversial/taboo"" topics and truths by how much push back I would receive for even discussing them.

I remember that questioning Monsanto was a BIG one. There was a massive propaganda effort deployed on reddit (and the internet in general) to attack and malign everyone who dared question the ""noble"" intentions of the abjectly corrupt company.

However, NO TOPIC came CLOSE to inciting abuse and harassment than questioning the vaccine paradigm.

When I realized that THIS was THE topic of concern, it became clear the vaccine/virus/pandemic issue was at the heart of the deception and war against the people being waged by these anti-human criminals.

As a result, I've made it my personal mission to sound the alarm about what they are currently attempting to implement. Not that several of these threads are 6 or 7 years old, which speaks to their persistence and the sheer amount of preparation leading to this planned pandemic:

- Now, as of today, Google purged all his instances and search terms off Google search engine (except his other websites, Facebook, etc)

- Mainstream media do not like Mike Adams (his nickname is the Health Ranger) because he is on Team Trump (even though he doesn't post many political articles)

- Big Pharma do not like him because he his anti Mercury/Thimersol in vaccines, and goes on about the other dangers of some medications etc

- Monsanto and the like do not like him because he does a lot of work and research on the dangers of GMO's

- Mike Adams has done a lot of great work for his fellow man. He tested water samples for free in cities across the nation after the flint water crises (which is still happening by the way)

- He is offering to do free water sample testing of Native American lands close to Oil Pipelines

Everyone can have their opinions on Mike Adams. Opinions don't matter right now.

What matters is Google took censorship into their own hands and purged information like this, which sets a scary and dangerous precedent.

The mandates and hospital protocols were always the actual pandemic, and were from the very start the primary causes of the majority of COVID deaths.

The only true emergency was always the criminal governments themselves. These wholly captured and “penetrated” regimes on the state and federal levels were enacting illegal mandates on behalf of their CIA, CFR, WEF, WHO, UN, Rockefeller and Gates handlers. This also happens to be why all of these carefully coordinated illegitimate mandates were perfectly in sync and nearly identical on a global scale.

### The Wheels of Justice Grind Exceedingly Slow. But They Grind Exceedingly Fine. And in New York City they are grinding apart the entire PSYOP-19 scam.

[https://twitter.com/riseupandresist/status/1584778811949793280](https://twitter.com/riseupandresist/status/1584778811949793280)

The decision correctly concluded that the Board of Health does not have the authority to unilaterally and indefinitely change the terms of employment for any agency.

Terminated city workers not only must be rehired, but they are also entitled to backpay.

The only issue with this decision is that it does not force NYC to compensate terminated employees for damages; this will require additional lawsuits that are more than legally justified given the conclusions of this decision.

Perhaps the most legally important part of this decision is the following:

>**Being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting of transmitting Covid-19.**

This one point opens up all of the PSYOP-19 perpetrators to lawsuits, starting with NYC Mayor Eric Adams’ own Advanced Team official who stated the following:

>**They chose not to do a very very harmless thing that protects society…Fuck ‘em!**

The slow kill bioweapon injections are anything but harmless and this can now easily be proven in a court of law, as well as establishing with a mere citation of the above line in the NYC decision that they confer exactly zero protection to anyone.

As a representative of Eric Adams’ administration, Chris Baum by his below interview exposes the NYC government to all kinds of additional lawsuits:

[https://twitter.com/laralogan/status/1582856691833442304](https://twitter.com/laralogan/status/1582856691833442304)

A critical point in the decision further established just how criminal all of these mandates are:

>The vaccination mandate for City employees was not just about safety and public health; it was about compliance. If it was about safety and public health, unvaccinated workers would have been placed on leave the moment the order was issued. If it was about safety and public health, the Health Commissioner would have issued city-wide mandates for vaccination for all residents.

This incontrovertibly demonstrates that these mandates were never about public health and safety, they were only ever about Statist control as conditioning measures ahead of the Great Reset enslavement agenda. And what better place to trial balloon social credit score systems with a citywide “vax” passport and other illegal and anti-human compliance measures than in a leftist city like NYC?

### Next Legal Steps

Now that the CDC will be adding the Modified mRNA poison to the childhood vaccine schedule, thus providing total immunity for the ~~manufacturers~~ murderers, lawsuits must immediately be filed against the ACIP, CDC and FDA.

Leveraging the momentum of this NYC decision, a series of lawsuits must be expedited to strip BigPharma of all of their vaccination liability protections by going after their agency partners in crime.

When it is irrefutably established that the ACIP, CDC and FDA are completely captured, and as such engaging in democide by perpetrating crimes against children and society as a whole, then the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act will be repealed. At that point BigPharma will be sued into oblivion. The time can’t come soon enough. Our future depends on it.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/coconut-oil-isnt-healthy-its-never-been-healthy/402719001/

It was posted on many other sites as well. But I will stick with USA today's. It doesn't really matter, because they are all the same.

Anyone who follows me, will know that I am a big stickler on MSM. Especially their lack of including sources. 

Did anyone notice the giant red flag right as you started to read?
If not, it was the video. Why would a study group have to money to make an anti-coconut oils video? They were just doing a study right? If they had the money to make a video as well, than it would suggest that the funders of this study were anti-coconut oil as well.

These days, I can spot a fake news article miles away. And usually I will pass on them. I have no interest in corporate interests. But this dis-info campaign hit close to home with me.

 I found this very interesting, because my daughter has a rare disorder where her body can not process long-chain fats, and needs to rely on medium-chain fats. We have a special doctors for this, but more importantly, we are required to meet with a group of university dieticians. Both of these told me that my daughter requires MCT. But also that coconut oil would be a suitable substitution. Yet this article refutes those claims made by specialist doctors, and dieticians. So I looked into this article, and this is what I found.

The lead author of this report, Dr. Frank Sacks has no Wiki. So I can not look much into his life, or his real opinions. But what I can find, is that he has created his own ""diet"" plan. And this seems like a promotion for said diet.

""Frank Sacks, lead author on the report, said he has no idea why people think coconut oil is healthy. It's almost 100% fat. Past weight loss studies might be responsible. ""

This is correct. And this broad term applies to all oils. And is complete mis-info. The difference is that coconut oil has medium-chain fats, and the main oils (whose owners probably helped fund this) had long-chain fats. And long chain fats are the bad type. Also, past weight loss studies may be responsible because anyone who is serious about losing weight, and sees a certified dietician will switch their fats to medium chain fats. Looks at the diets of Tom Brady, and Giselle for example.

“The reason coconut oil is so popular for weight loss is partly due to my research on medium chain triglycerides,"" which they dispute with ""St-Onge's research used a ""designer oil"" packed with 100% MCTs. Traditional coconut oil only contains about 13 to 15%""

And yet, they never discuss Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II which is the main enzyme that breaks down the long-chain fats. Also if you simply do some research you will find that ""Traditional coconut oil"" contains 62-65% MCTs.

The article concludes with the fact that ""people who cut saturated fat out of their diet might not necessarily lower their heart disease risk... ...That's because some people fill the void with sugar, white flour and empty calories."" Which dismisses the whole point.

Lastly it goes on to recommend vegetable oil, or Olive oil. Are you joking me! Look at some real scientific studies on those. Not the ones that are paid for by big agriculture. This mans ""diet"" is literally the old ""Food Pyramid"" you learned about in grade school. And that has been proven to be sponsored by agricultural interest. Not real health interests.

Now let's go even deeper. Here is a link to the American Heart Association report that triggered the news articles:

http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/early/2017/06/15/CIR.0000000000000510.full.pdf

And I admit, I like this link. But there is only a TINY snippet on coconut oil. And all of that is in regards to cholesterol. So the negative results of coconut oil is going to effect rich Americans, and Europeans (http://imgur.com/a/ZCRjF) more than anyone else. And that is probably because they were eating bad in the first place. Coconut oil can be a preventative. But it is not a medicine to cure your cholesterol. It appears briefly on page 13 (of 25.)

So let's dissect that a little closer.

Here is my reply to this. I will only state important parts (leaving out things like surveys of opinions, ect.)

>The fatty acid profile of coconut oil is 82% saturated, about half lauric acid, and the rest myristic, palmitic, stearic, and short-chain fatty acids (Table).

There is nothing wrong with this. Lauric acids are medium chain fatty acids. This is perfectly healthy. 

>Lauric acid replacing carbohydrates increases LDL cholesterol but by about half as much as myristic and palmitic acids

No one is recommending using coconut oil, and cutting carbs. You need carbs. 

>the informative comparison is between coconut oil and vegetable oils high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats

Coconut oil can not be high in polyunasturated fats as it is not a nut. seed. or fish. The comparisons are hogwash.

> This leaves out the very important part of who the test was on. And when it was conducted. This was a test from 12 years ago, and it was with people with elevated cholesterol levels. It shows source [95] but it is up to the reader to actually look into that. Here is the link to the actual study. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7595099

>Another carefully controlled experiment found that coconut oil significantly increased LDL cholesterol compared with olive oil.96

Again, this was an odd test that only involved Malaysians, that ate a traditional Malaysian diet. And they were testing coconut oil separately from the other 2, with full understanding that Diets high in palmitic acid, lauric and myristic acids, and  lauric and myristic acids are completely different.

BUT they found that all 3 were HEALTHY! 

Here is a link to the actual study. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030224

> A recent systematic review found 7 controlled trials, including the 2 just mentioned, that compared coconut oil with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils.97 Coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol in all 7 of these trials, significantly in 6 of them. The authors also noted that the 7 trials did not find a difference in raising LDL cholesterol between coconut oil and other oils high in saturated fat such as butter, beef fat, or palm oil.

They sum it up with ""we advise against the use of coconut oil.""

Well one of the 2 studies they mentions, says that coconut oil is healthy in the title! 

Here is the study they quote: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946252.

I have a problem with the researchers, but I will leave that out for this. They are only talking about Cholesterol. And all they say is that certain plant oils are better for Cholesterol than coconut oil, but coconut oil is still better than butter, beef fat, and palm oil.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no paid interest here. But I am inclined as a father to research these things because my daughters life is affected by it. Don't buy this guys BS. He is just trying to promote his ""New Diet Plan"". And that in itself is BS. It is just promoting US oil, and agriculture companies.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Ok I posted this in another sub (That I am not allowed to mention here) and I had a user ""call me out"" so to say. I thought I would copy my reply to him here, as it is always good to see some controversial points as well.

>You declare it “fake news” and a disinfo campaign but don’t really substantiate that. The latter is a very big claim. Who is behind the disinfo, who is it aimed at, and why?

""Frank Sacks, lead author on the report, said he has no idea why people think coconut oil is healthy. It's almost 100% fat."" The lead author is behind it. He is trying to tell people that because coconut oil if fat, it is unhealthy. Yet he recommends other oils that are also fat. But can be worse once cooked due to becoming carcinogenic. That is the only reference to mis-info I used. ""Who is behind it"" Rank Sacks. and *possibly* others. I will mention that shortly. ""Who is it aimed at?"" Most likely IMHO the people he is selling his ""Diet"" too, and people that are on the fence about using coconut oil. ""Why"" I have no idea. This other is odd, in that he has no wiki, which for a person of his status, should. And that he has done previous reports that are contractual to this new one. 

""Who is behind it"" part 2, other than Sacks. I can not be certain, but he does advertise The Standard American Diet (SAD) which is one of the primary fuels of not only big agriculture, but big pharma. If we all ate a healthy diet, the medical mafia would be dead and gone within a few short years.

It's worth noting (again) that Dr Sacks has numerous Journal publications on mortality studies on long chain fatty acids. Seems somewhat controversial to this article.

>Does this relate to your claims and accusations about who funded the study that you don’t look into or substantiate either? It’s a presidential advisory put together by the AHA and all the authors are listed. You can put together some proof of bias and anti-coconut oil, US oil, and agricultural funding and get back to us.

So we know it was funded by the AHA. And the lead author wwas Frank Sacks.

Let's look into AHA's funding. AHA is a 501(c) non-profit. In the last fiscal year they had $863,355,000 in total revenue. Approximately 20.8% was from Corporate sponsors. (~$180 million) [Source}(http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@fin/documents/downloadable/ucm_491971.pdf) 2-page pdf.

I can't believe I am doing this right now, but if you look the AHA's most recent tax documents [SOURCE](http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@fin/documents/downloadable/ucm_491516.pdf) 148 page PDF. Under Part II-B In their schedule C 990. You will see their purpose, and it is an congressional lobbying group. I am sure you know about lobbying groups. They are heavily funded by special interest groups. They obviously are doing other good things as well. But as their purpose in healthy hearts is great, I am more interested in the practice. You can see the board members, and highest paid employees names, but they are hard to find online.

On schedule F, part 1 you see their investments. And in the region of coconut oil producers, their investments Trump all others except for Europe. 41 million, vs. the next closest, 18 mil. for N. America. Which also trumps the next closest, 2.5 mil for all of south america.

So maybe they are investing in coconut oil, while hurting the market, so that they can get a larger profit gain. Glad I looked into that.

Schedule 1 part 2 shows donations, and I found an odd one. 173,000 to a 501c georgia bikes, who also receives donations from Americans largest oil veggie oil producer. Just found that interesting.

But here is what I was looking for: $1.45 million to Frank Sacks employer. EIN-04-2103580 for ""Reasearch""

Schedule M, part 1 shows non cash donations. 

Some oddities, 436 automobiles, 289 shares of stocks valued ~4 million., 2,172 collectables, 1 add council add valued at 58.6 million, 2,003 paid travels, 5,867 instances of donated ""recreation"".

They also state that they intend to sell the donated cars. I figured as much.

OK. I read the whole tax return. There is no note of who the donors are, but what we have is a congressional lobbying group, that receives many odd donations, that *could* be used to persuade politicians to vote favorably.

Also, the amount of investments in coconut producing areas of the world may be a cause for this dis-info campaign. They could be trying to buy up stock, and than later recant their studies with new ones.",conspiracy,big pharma

So let’s proceed. Australia has fallen. Canada is in the midst of falling. Europe is looking bleak. There are mass protests all over the globe. Awareness is growing faster than censorship can keep up with. 

We are at a crossroads in our society. We are at the point of no return. The globalists, the Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission, The World Economic Forum, The United Nations,  The Gates Foundation, The Elites; whatever you want to call them or label them as, have gone all in. (At this point if you don’t recognize some of these groups, it is essential to understanding them.) 

If you deny this much, stop reading here. This post is too much for you and you have much homework to do if you believe our leaders of any party, three letter agency, or politicians give a single shit about you. They don’t. Go back to your safe space because this post is about reality.

The teeter totter hypothesis proposes that society happens in cycles, and eventually when a cycle is made, there can only be one outcome, the question is, how do we decide the outcome?

We must weigh our options carefully to keep the teeter totter balanced. But eventually societies and nations collapse. Even the great ones. Sumerians fell. Egyptians fell. Greeks fell. The Romans fell. The Aztecs fell. The Mayans fell. Germany fell. The USSR fell. 

A myriad of cultures, languages, political systems, capital systems, ideologies, races, all fell in due time. It is the way of life, but time marches forward, and like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, man also lifts himself up after the worst of tragedies, wars, and famine.

The United States is currently that society falling. I realize Reddit is much bigger than America, but the brutal truth, despite the massive disinformation campaign globally to make America seem inept after years of Trump, is that we are the leading hub of the world. I’m just about every metric. We are the leading cultural hub of the world. We are the largest consumers. We produce entertainment through Hollywood and music. We have the most public companies. New York City is the center of finance in the world. Silicon Valley is the center of technological progress. We have the largest military in the world. 

And yet, we have failed.

America has failed. Some have connected the dots and realized this, some haven’t, some still believe in their futile attempts to resurrect a nation that time has passed by. To my next point, again I reiterate, if you believe any democratic or Republican politician, Biden, Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, AOC, etc. is going to save you, stop reading. You have much homework to do. We are entirely past that. No three letter agency or institution is going to come to your rescue.

We have been domesticated as a species to accept our mundane way of life the past 6 decades. You go to school to get a job to pay your taxes to have children and continue the cycle. You hopefully enjoy a hobby or two, a musical instrument, play a sport, read some books, and then you die. 

We have lost all spiritual and religious connection. The almighty dollar and the rat race to the bottom fuels all. Communism doesn’t work, and capitalism is the best we have. Rules for thee, but not for me. There is no middle class. That’s a myth. There’s only those with capital, the poor, and the less poor. Humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth. The difference between 100k and 1 million, isn’t all that different than 1 million and 1 billion to the average mind who considers these numbers an after thought. The fact that the top tax brackets ends at 400k and upward is a travesty when one considers the wealth of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos.

The ‘leaders’, whether elected or not (looking at you Klaus Schwab), have planted their flags into the ground and made their global stance known. In order to form a global government, a government of a global people with a common goal and ideology, nationalism, capitalism, borders, and pride in your nation must be eradicated and driven out. 

No matter your views on origin, treatment, or the real facts of Covid, one thing is certain. The elite class has taken advantage of the opportunities at every turn. If you cannot see the writing on the wall, again, please stop reading. Go to another sub. This is the conspiracy sub, not CNN or WorldNews. There they will coddle you and reinforce the sheep narrative of confirmation bias with a revolving door echo chamber.

The grim reality is that society is a carefully crafted illusion that is a house of cards. If businesses stopped worldwide even for a day, the system collapses. If the world currency exchange quit relying on the US Dollar and Federal Reserve, the world collapses. We are mere moments at any given time from complete anarchy. This is why these elites, no matter how high they perceive themselves in a world of lesser people, have to be kept somewhat in check. Mass societies turning on their politicians (public servants) is all it takes for a complete revolution.

They have to keep things balanced to maintain order and the illusion of a society that knows no bounds and life is just peachy. 

Now with AI and tech surpassing prior levels of understanding at a rapid pace, the world is changing. Soon there will be no need for police officers. Robotic entities will replace them. Every cashier will be replaced. Every mundane function will be replaced. In time, these giant monopolistic corporations will be able to produce revenue without you. At that point we will be expendable. Cattle. Leeches of a dying system. And it’s coming. You can deny it, run from it, stall it, but it’ll inevitably arrive all the same. The only choice you DO have is how you will react in this lifetime. 

Many or most of this entire generation doesn’t know the harsh realities of history. They have lived in relative times of peace and prosperity. Even the poor in this country will have an iPhone with a roof over their head and a warm meal to keep them from starvation. 

The first possible solution is depopulation. It’s a relatively simple decision to arrive at. There are too many people. Not enough resources. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs. Too much healthcare costs. Fiat money is collapsing under inflation in real time. Climate change will cause large swaths of populations to have to migrate to other lands. Foot shortages and supply chain breakdowns are inevitable. The cozy life you know of being able to get anything and everything down the street at the local Walmart is winding to an end. 

So it seems like a decent proposition to the global elite. The populace is waking up. Kill them off. Reset the system. And educate (propaganda) the youth to reteach them everything about our society. After all, history is written by the victors, not the losers. 

To anyone wondering why Covid would be used to depopulate us and what they have to gain, that’s a large part of that answer. The fourth industrial revolution. So according to this option, we surrender, most die through one means or another, and we place our trust in a global syndicate that has laid out a path and foundation for society to progress forward, albeit in vastly smaller numbers of people. 

Option 2. Revolution. 

You can only achieve so much in this world by peaceful and meaningful protesting. Nobody wants violence. Nobody wants bloodshed. Most of humanity just wants their right to liberty and freedom, to spend cherished time with their loved ones, and perhaps even contribute to society in a great way. We just want to be left alone. 

But when you push people into a corner, much the way a scared animal reacts, people will snap if you push them too far. When a percentage of society hates you just for being white, or straight, or believing in a higher power than themselves, our society has been lost past the point of return. Divide and conquer is a real strategy that has been taking place for millennia. Their biggest free is our solidarity and unity; humanity taking care of themselves and uniting no matter their race, gender, political affiliation, age, culture, or economic background, against the very people who try to divide and distract us from the real evils of society.

The narrative shifts when it suits their purposes. Notice how the previous summer the BLM riots and destruction were justified in the eyes of the elites? They were entitled to it. It was for a just cause. But yet, when much more peaceful protests happens at the nations capitol, in the oddest, most unique election in our nations history believe there is foul play and protest, they are criminals. Any time true protests or riots happen, suddenly they are painted and smeared by the media. If we went by today’s standards, these same politicians would have you convinced that our founding fathers in 1776 were insurrectionists against England. 

Well no shit. That’s the point, the people had enough and revolted. No taxation without representation. Take your laws, kings, and unjust taxes and shove it up your ass. We no longer comply and submit to the King or any of their bestowed leaders. We are a United Nation of free people with the right to pursue life and liberty. 

…but today, our nation is being slowly brainwashed into believing we are all an evil divided people who must look to those very same leaders who sought so many generations ago to escape. Real revolution  requires this. It’s an undeniable fact. No real revolution has ever been spurred by protestors sitting in the streets stopping traffic with “tax the rich” signs. It happens when leaders lose their carefully crafted grip on the people and no longer can control them, forcing them to relinquish power and submit to the will of the people, 

The last and least likely option is mass overhaul. This would’ve been possible in simpler times. But the tentacles of this empire make Rome look like Child’s play. When corruption spans many nations and peoples, let alone the agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI, FDA, IRS, NIH, WHO, CDC, FDA, etc. 

It’s lost. It’s too far gone. And overhauling a system spanning decades of infiltrated corruption is impossible. It must be completely eradicated from the foundation up. Our founding fathers tried their best to ensure we would never be overtaken. They knew from the very beginning, if America fell, it would be from within its own borders, not externally from another source. 

The media, big pharma, big tech, big government, and the military industrial complex have consolidated so much power it’s just simply not conceivable to overhaul such a vast and broken system. 


We are now at a crossroads in humanity. Our leaders have failed us. Our public servants betrayed us. Our CEOs enslaved us. 

The teeter totter is starting to rock back and forth, losing its balance. The scales are tipping. The only control they have over it is censorship and age old techniques to convince the populace of their desired outcome through mass scale propaganda. 

I want you to ask yourself. In 20, 30, 40 years, will you be able to look in the eyes or your child, and explain to them how we let it get so bad? Will you be able to justify staying silent? Because you were scared to lose your reputation? Your job? Your friends? 

Because that time is coming. Our world is changing. Tech is replacing God. Public education is replacing wisdom. Adultery and greed is replacing love and selflessness. Our history is being erased and rewritten. Our freedoms are slowly eroding away in the name of safety. Our privacy is slowly being stripped in the name of security. Our data is being harvested and sold to the highest bidder to keep us in this perpetual never ending cycle of a slow descent into hell. 

I don’t care if your leader is Ghandi, Biden, Jesus, Mohammed, Trump, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It is time to unite as a people and reclaim our rights as a humanity. To love our neighbor. To give back to the less fortunate. To extend our hand and help one another. To show love and freedom of expression. 

Because if we don’t. Make no mistake the teeter totter will continue to tip. And it will eventually tip the scale towards depopulation or revolution. I only ask that we come together as a society, as a United people before it is too late.

The figures are fantastic.

Some *eight million people die every year from cancer worldwide*, more than half a million in the United States alone. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030.

Cancer is the biggest cause of death for people under 85 and in the US one in four people die from cancer - one in four.

We have our freedoms removed by the day to 'protect the public from terrorism' when all these people are suffering and dying every year from a disease that the bloodline families and their pharmaceutical cartel systematically refuse to cure.

&#x200B;

I highlighted in a newsletter on August 9th how a man called Dr **Richard Day**, the head of the [**Rockefeller**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_rockefeller.htm)\-controlled eugenics organization, [Planned Parenthood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood), had addressed a meeting of doctors in Pittsburgh in 1969 about the coming transformation of global society.

He asked the doctors to turn off recording equipment and not to take notes before he detailed a long list of changes that were planned. One doctor did take notes, however, and later talked publicly about what was said.

Now, 40 years later, we can see how extraordinarily accurate Day was and you can read that August newsletter in the archive on the website.

The reason I mention him again here is that he told those doctors in 1969:

>'We can cure almost every cancer right now. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute, if it's ever decided that it should be released.'

Day said that letting people die of cancer would slow down population growth.

>'You may as well die of cancer as something else'.

These people no soul and that's why they do what they do.

*Big Pharma has no desire to cure cancer* when it is making **vast fortunes** from treating the symptoms with devastating drugs and cell-killing, people-killing poisons like chemotherapy. But it is not primarily even about money. The bloodline families want people to suffer and die earlier than necessary as a way of culling the population.

This is why when anyone outside [the Big Pharma cabal](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_industryweapons.htm) discovers an effective way of treating cancer they are immediately targeted by the medical establishment and government agencies.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k6fjxd9s3gp61.jpg?width=297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a28344e542eff95024790edd8ff946f343fe051e

One such case is the Italian doctor, [**Tullio Simoncini**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_cancerfungus.htm), a brilliant and courageous man who has refused to bow to the enormous pressure he has faced, and continues to face, after he realized what cancer is and how it can be dealt with.

Simoncini's 'crime' has been to *discover that cancer is a fungus caused by* [*Candida*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(genus)), a yeast-like organism that lives in the body in small amounts even in healthy people. The immune system keeps it under control normally, but when the Candida morphs into a powerful fungus some serious health problems can follow - including cancer.

My friend, **Mike Lambert**, at the *Shen Clinic* near my home on the Isle of Wight, says of Candida:

>'Fungus, and Candida in particular, thrive by eating the body of its host (yours) by dissolving it. It also needs your body to breed, as it can't do this on its own. No wonder in Chronic Fatigue conditions, which can in many cases be attributed to *Candida colonization*, the sufferer feels so bad both physically and psychologically.'

Tullio Simoncini says that cancer is this Candida fungal infection and that the conventional medical explanation of cancer as a cellular malfunction is plain wrong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ Candida ](https://preview.redd.it/g42t9p5u3gp61.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30bed8cbe7fe76f547414ce2666a89247029992b)

Simoncini is a specialist in oncology (treatment of tumors), diabetes and metabolic disorders, but he is more than that. He is a real doctor who seeks to uncover the truth for the benefit of his patients and refuses to parrot the official version of what doctors should do and think.

He challenges the dogma of 'intellectual conformity' with all its unproven assumptions, lies, manipulation and falsehoods and he has been extremely critical of the medical establishment as it continues to pursue 'treatments' that are useless in curing the global epidemic of cancer.

From the time he entered medicine he realized that something was seriously wrong with the way cancer was treated:

>'I see terrible sufferings. I was in a pediatric oncological ward - all the children died. I was suffering when I was looking at the poor, poor children dying with **chemo**, with **radiation**.'

His frustration and sorrow at what he was seeing led him to go in search of new ways to understand, and therefore treat, this devastating disease.

He began his journey with an open mind and a blank sheet of paper unsullied by any rigid assumptions pedaled and indoctrinated by mainstream 'medicine' and 'science'.

&#x200B;

[How many more have to suffer before people stop seeing doctors as all-knowing 'gods' and realize the stupendous scale of ignorance involved?](https://preview.redd.it/gvlkmciw3gp61.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d2fdaf7095d94cba4a35271dcb44871adb69b766)

Simoncini realized that all cancers acted the same way no matter where they were in the body or what form they took. There had to be a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer 'lumps' were always white.

What else is white? Candida.

Simoncini realized that what mainstream medicine believed to be cell growth going wild - 'cancerous growth' - is actually *the immune system producing cells to defend the body from Candida attack.*

He says the sequence goes like this:

>Candida is normally kept under control by the immune system, but when that becomes undermined and weakened the Candida can expand and build a 'colony'The Candida eventually penetrates an organ and the immune system has to respond to the threat in another wayThis 'way' is to build a defensive barrier with its own cells and this growth is what we call cancer

It is said that the spreading of cancer to other parts of the body is caused by 'malignant' cells escaping from their origin.

Simoncini, however, says this is not the case at all. The spread of cancer is triggered by the real cause of cancer, *the Candia fungus*, escaping from the original source.

What allows cancer to manifest, as I have been saying in my books for years, is a *weakened immune system*. When that is working efficiently it deals with the problem before it gets out of hand.

In this case, it keeps the Candida under control.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f8ss3ty3gp61.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d283cd2fd658c42c427f73a1979e31ef042aeb76

But look at what has been happening as cancer numbers worldwide have soared and soared. There has been a calculated war on the human immune system that has got more vociferous with every decade.

The immune system is weakened and attacked by food and drink additives, chemical farming, [vaccinations](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas.htm), [electromagnetic and microwave technology](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scalar_tech/esp_scalartech_cellphonesmicrowave.htm) and frequencies, [pharmaceutical drugs](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_industryweapons.htm), the stress of modern 'life', and so much more.

What defenses are today's children going to have when they are given 25 vaccinations and combinations of them, before the age of two - while their immune system is still forming for goodness sake?

This is how [the Illuminati](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_illuminati.htm) families are seeking to instigate [*a mass cull of the population*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_depopu.htm). By dismantling the body's natural defense to disease.

Now, here's the real shocker. What destroys the immune system quicker than anything else?

**CHEMOTHERAPY**

You can add radiation to that as well. Chemotherapy is a poison designed to **kill** cells. Er..., that's it.

The 'cutting-edge' of mainstream cancer 'treatment' is to poison the victim and hope that you kill the cancer cells before you have killed enough healthy cells to kill the patient.

But wait. This chemotherapy poison also kills the cells of the immune system and leaves it shot to pieces. And the Candida is still there.

This devastated immune system cannot respond effectively to the Candida and it takes over other parts of the body to start the process again, so causing the cancer to spread. Even those who appear to have recovered after surgery and chemotherapy and been given 'the all-clear' are just a ticking clock.

Their immune system is now shattered and it is only a matter of time before the Candida triggers a relapse. In other words:

Chemotherapy is killing the people it is supposed to be curing.

Of course, it can never 'cure' anyone of anything, except life. It is *a poison destroying the very system* that we need to be healthy and strong if we are to be cured.

When Simoncini realized that cancer is a fungal infection, or infestation, he went in search of something that would kill the fungus and so remove the cancer.

He realized that anti-fungal drugs don't work because the fungus quickly mutates to defend itself and then even starts to feed off the drugs that are prescribed to kill it.

Instead, Simoncini found something much, much simpler - [sodium bicarbonate](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_defeatcancer.htm#Sodium_Bicarbonate_Treatmens). Yes, the *main ingredient in good old baking soda* (but I stress not the same as baking soda, which has other ingredients).

He used this because it is a powerful destroyer of fungus and, unlike the drugs, the Candida cannot 'adapt' to it.

The patient is given sodium bicarbonate orally and through internal means like an endoscope, a long thin tube that doctors use to see inside the body without surgery. This allows the sodium bicarbonate to be placed directly on the cancer - the fungus.

The ancient Egyptians knew about the healing properties of anti-fungal substances and Indian books going back a thousand years actually recommend 'alkaline of strong potency' for treating cancer.

In 1983, Simoncini treated an Italian man, Gennaro Sangermano, who had been given months to live with lung cancer. A few months later he wasn't dead, he was back to health and the cancer was gone.

More success followed and Simoncini presented his findings to the Italian Department of Health in the hope that they would begin scientifically-approved trials to show that it worked.

But he was to learn the true scale of **medical manipulation** and **deceit**.

The authorities not only ignored his documentation, he was disbarred from the *Italian Medical Order* for prescribing cures that had not been approved. Yep, I really said that - for prescribing cures that had not been approved.

He was subjected to a vicious campaign of ridicule and condemnation by the pathetic media and then jailed for three years for causing 'wrongful death' to patients he had treated. From all angles the word was out - get Simoncini.

The medical establishment said that his claims about sodium bicarbonate were 'crazy' and 'dangerous'. One 'leading doctor' even ludicrously referred to sodium bicarbonate as a 'drug'.

All the time millions of people were dying from cancers that could have been treated effectively. These people *don't give a shit.*

**Tullio Simoncini** is, thankfully, no quitter and he has continued to circulate his work on the Internet and in public talks. I heard of him through Mike Lambert at the [Shen Clinic](http://www.theshenclinic.com/) and Simoncini spoke there while I was away in the United States.

I know that he is having remarkable success in dramatically reducing and removing altogether even some real late stage cancers using sodium bicarbonate. This can take months in some cases, but in others, like breast cancer where the tumor is easily accessible, it *can be days* before it is no more.

People are also curing themselves under Simoncini's guidance and at the end of this article I have linked to some videos in which you can hear people talk about their experiences and cures.

I wrote a newsletter last April about the fact that cancer is a fungus in an article about the findings of two British scientists and researchers, Professor **Gerry Potter** of the *Cancer Drug Discovery Group* and Professor **Dan Burke**.

Their combined findings reveal the following ...

>Cancer cells have a unique 'biomarker' that normal cells do not, an enzyme called [CYP1B1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP1B1) (pronounced sip-one-bee-one). Enzymes are proteins that 'catalyze' (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.The CYP1B1 alters the chemical structure of something called [salvestrols](http://www.salvestrol.ca/aboutsalvestrols.asp) that are found naturally in many fruit and vegetables. This chemical change turns the *salvestrols* into an agent that kills cancer cells, but does no harm to healthy cells.

The synchronicity is perfect. The CYP1B1 enzyme appears only in cancer cells and it reacts with *salvestrols* in fruit and vegetables to create a chemical substance that kills only cancer cells.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5nehyq534gp61.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce6b76a672c359c7a9331948f66ca1686c9e8d5b

But here's the point with regard to cancer being a fungus.

*Salvestrols* are the natural defense system in fruit and vegetables against fungal attacks and that's why you only find them in those species subject to fungus damage, like strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, grapes, blackcurrants, redcurrants, blackberries, cranberries, apples, pears, green vegetables (especially broccoli and the cabbage family), artichokes, red and yellow peppers, avocados, watercress, asparagus and aubergines.

What's more, the [Big Pharma/Big Biotech cartels](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_industryweapons.htm) know all this and they have done two major things to undermine this natural defense from the fungal attack that is cancer.

>The chemical fungicide sprays used in modern farming kill fungus artificially and this means the plants and crops do not have to trigger their own defense - *salvestrols*. You only find them in any amount today in *organically grown food*The most widely-used fungicides are very powerful blockers of CYP1B1 and so if you eat enough chemically-produced food it wouldn't matter how many *salvestrols* you consumed they would not be activated into the cancer-destroying agent they are designed to be

This is not by accident, but by calculated design, as were, and are, the attempts by the establishment to destroy Tullio Simoncini.

The families want people to die of cancer, not be cured of it. They are mentally and emotionally as sick as you can imagine and see humans as sheep and cattle.

They don't care how much distress, suffering and death their manipulation and suppression will cause - the more the better from their insane perspective. And that is what these people are... insane.

But Simoncini refuses to buckle and continues to campaign for what has seen is an effective treatment for cancer, while, in the 'real' world, the number of cancer deaths goes on rising incessantly because of treatments that don't work based on assumptions that aren't true.

It is indeed a crazy, crazy society, but then, from the perspective of the bloodline families, it's meant to be. Thank goodness for courageous and committed people like **Tullio Simoncini**.

We need more like him - *and* *quick*\*.\*

What a stark contrast he is to those who serve the medical establishment. When Simoncini spoke at the Shen Clinic a few weeks ago (below video) some local doctors dismissed him before he arrived and ridiculed his views.

If you were born prior to 1989, your chance of having a chronic disease, according to HHS (Health and Human Services) is 12.8%. If you are born after 1989, your chance of having a chronic disease is 54%. And the FDA has said to the vaccine companies, you need to take a look at these diseases.
And what are these diseases?

They’re the neuro-developmental diseases, ADD, ADHD, language delays, speech delays, tics, Tourette Syndrome, ASD, and autism. The auto-immune disorders, Guillan-Barre, multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The anyphylactic diseases, food allergies, rhinitis, asthma, and eczema. All of these exploded in 1989.

Congress ordered the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to find out which year this disease epidemic started. And EPA did that study. They said it started in 1989. There are a lot of culprits. Many new things. We have cell-phones. We have PFOA (perfluorooctanic acid). We have ultra-sound. We have glyphosate. We have many other things. Our kids are swimming in a toxic soup.

We’re not saying all of those illnesses came from vaccines. But there is no intervention that is so exquisite and precisely timed as what happened when we went in 1989 and changed that vaccine schedule and raised the levels of aluminum and mercury, tripled and quintupled them. We went from the 3 vaccines that I had, to the 72 my kids had, and to the 75 that kids are going to get next year. And there are 273 new vaccines in the pipeline.

I went in and met with Adam Schiff. I’ve been a democrat all my life. What’s happening in the democratic party disturbs me greatly. But I was astonished when one of the leading democrats in our country, Adam Schiff, went to the internet titans, to Facebook, to Google, which has a $668 million dollar partnership with GlaxoSmithKline, the biggest vaccine maker in the world. They make drugs and mine your personal data so they can sell you more drugs. Schiff went to Pintrest, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, all of them, and told them they need to start censoring information and complaints about a pharmaceutical product.

I said to Adam Schiff, “You know these are greedy companies. You know they’re homicidal.” Any democrat will tell you that. The four companies that produce all 72 vaccines that are mandated for American children, every one of them is a convicted felon. Since 2009, those four companies collectively have paid $35 billion dollars in criminal penalties and damages and fines for defrauding regulators, for falsifying science, for bribing doctors, for lying to the public, and for killing lots and lots of people.

Vioxx, a drug made by Merck, they knew it would cause heart attacks. They sold it as a headache pill. They didn’t tell people, you won’t have a headache, but you might have a heart attack. Of course, if they had, not too many people would have bought it.

So, they decided to keep it a secret. They killed a hundred and twenty thousand people minimum, probably five hundred thousand people. So I said to Adam Schiff, “What kind of cognitive dissonance does it require, to believe that this company, which is lying and cheating and killing with every other pharmaceutical product it makes, has found Jesus when it comes to vaccines?” Everybody knows you can’t sue a vaccine company. That’s why we had this gold rush explosion of vaccines beginning in 1989.

They have no incentive to make their product safe, other than their moral scruples, of which we know they have none.

What most people don’t know is that vaccine companies have an even more important exemption.

They are exempt from safety testing their products. It is the only medical product. The reason is that it’s an artifact of the CDC’s legacy as the public health service, which was a quasi-military agency. The CDC took it over in the late 1970s. That’s why people at the CDC often have military rank, like the Surgeon General. The vaccine program was initiated as a national security defense against biological attack. Because of that they wanted to make sure we could get vaccines out to the public very quickly if Russia sent anthrax over here. They wanted to remove all the regulatory impediments that would prevent the quick deployment of that product.

So, they said, if we call it a medicine, all medicines have to be safety-tested under the law, double-blind placebo, and follow-up for five years. They said, we can’t do that. We’re going to call them something different. We’re going to call them “biologics.” And we’re going to make it so they don’t have to be tested at all.
And when the industry exploded in 1989, they took advantage of this loophole when they brought all of these new products to market. Not one of the 72 vaccines on the schedule mandated for our children, have been tested with a placebo.

That means that nobody can scientifically tell you what the risk profile of that product is. Nobody can tell you that product is going to save more lives than it will take. There is no scientific basis whatsoever. How can we as a society, a government, a democratic party, be mandating products for our children when we cannot tell what the risk is of that product?

Now, all of the vaccines on the schedule, and all medical products, are required to list whatever safety testing they do. Not one of these has ever used a placebo. But some of them do safety testing anyway, like the polio vaccine, for maybe 48 hours.

The hepatitis B vaccine that is given to every child in this country on the day it’s born, they observe for 5 days. That means if a child dies on day 6, it never happened. If a child has a seizure on day 6, it never happened. If the baby gets food allergies and is diagnosed three years later, or autism or an auto-immune disease, it never happened. That way they can say it’s safe.

The weird thing is that there was one vaccine, the MMR vaccine, that all of this hoopla is about, it’s the only vaccine that has no safety testing listed on the insert. And for many years, Del [Bigtree] and I have been saying, “that’s weird.” Do any exist? What happened? So we sued HHS. We said, “where is it?”
Three weeks ago they gave us the safety testing. There were 800 kids. Normally you have 20,000 kids or subjects in one of these. There were 800 kids in 8 different categories. For a drug they are going to give to billions of people. The testing lasted only 42 days.

But 50% of the kids who were involved in that study had gastro-intestinal illnesses, serious ones, some of them for the full 42 days. 50% had respiratory illnesses, some of them for 42 days. This is a product that is worse, according to its own record, than the illness it’s pretending to prevent.

Maybe there are people here who are anti-vaxx. I am not anti-vaxx. I just want safe vaccines. And I want robust science. And I want transparency in government. And I want independent regulators who are not owned by pharma.

At the FDA, which is supposed to protect us against these products, receives 75% of its budget from the industry. The World Health Organization (WHO) receives 50% of its budget from pharma. The CDC is a pharmaceutical company. It has about $5 billion dollars a year that it buys and sells vaccines. And individuals within HHS who worked on those vaccines at taxpayer expense, if they worked on them, they’re allowed to get royalty payments.

Every vial of Gardasil that’s sold, there are people within HHS, high-level individuals, who are collecting $150,000 a year in royalties. And HHS and NIH own part of that patent and are collecting money every year. These are not regulatory agencies. They are appendages of the industry.

They don’t want to hear about this. The reason they call you and me anti-vaxx is it’s a way of shutting us up. So they don’t have to debate these very serious issues about vaccine safety. So they don’t have to debate the science.

And they’ve bought off the press. They put $25 billion dollars a year into advertising. We’re the only nation in the world, other than New Zealand, that allows pharmaceutical advertising on television. And they’ve been able to buy the press in this country. They’re not only selling ads for their drugs, but they’re also dictating content.

Now they’re telling us they’re going to censor Facebook because they want to get rid of misinformation about vaccines. We’re just talking about science. We’re giving them peer-review. You’ll never hear peer-review from a vaccine proponent. What you’ll hear are appeals to authority. What does that mean? It means that vaccines are safe because CDC or WHO says they’re safe.

But do you know who the ultimate authority is? It’s the Institute of Medicine. That is why Congress named the Institute of Medicine to be the ultimate authority on vaccine safety. And do you know what the Institute of Medicine says? It says there are 150 diseases that they think are caused by vaccines, and the CDC has been directed to study them. They said that in 1994. CDC refused. They said it again in 1998. CDC refused. They said it again in 2011. They say it every year.

The Institute of Medicine says we have no idea whether these vaccines are causing this huge chronic disease epidemic. That is the ultimate authority. Not WHO. Not CDC. And the only way they can deal with these arguments is by shutting us up.

The vaccine misinformation is not coming from us, it’s coming from them. How many of you have heard the networks report that 80,000 people died of flu last year? You know what CDC’s data said? And CDC told the networks that number. I don’t blame them, but the press is supposed to check. My father told me, people in power lie. And you’re supposed to check on it. You know what CDC’s own data said? 2300 people died of flu, not 80,000.

How many of you have heard that the death rate for measles is 1 in 1,000? CDC told them that. CDC’s own data says that it’s 1 in 10,000 people and 1 in 500,000 Americans. That’s what CDC’s data says. But that’s not what you’ll hear from the networks.

Any of you who watched NBC the other night saw Lester Holt. All of the news shows have become advertisements and they’re all part of this orchestrated frenzy that we’re terrified of measles. And we’ve got to get this vaccine and we’ve got to pass this mandate. Lester Holt is sponsored by Merck, which makes the vaccine. Lester Holt showed a frightening picture on his show of a baby that was afflicted by these terrible measles bumps. It turns out it was fake. He had to fake it. He’s never apologized. NBC never apologized. That is misinformation.
And Lester Holt is sitting there saying we’ve got to shut down this misinformation about vaccines while he is the primary promoter of that information.

This industry has been able to disable all of the institutions of our democracy that stand between a greedy corporation and a vulnerable child. As Del pointed out, they are the biggest lobbyists on Capitol Hill. There are more lobbyists than Congressmen and Senators combined. They give double the amount of oil and gas. They give four times what defense and aerospace give.

They own Congress. That’s why Congress will not subpoena Bill Thompson, the chief scientist at CDC who says they’ve been lying to us for all these years. They’ve been destroying data. And they won’t call him in and question him.

They have been able to disable the regulatory agencies through capture. Those agencies are now sock-puppets for the industries they’re supposed to regulate. They’ve been able to neutralize the lawyers by making it illegal to sue a vaccine company. The lawyers and the courts are gone.

They’ve been able to neutralize the press, all press scrutiny. Now, they’re neutralizing the internet. They’re shutting us down so we cannot speak. So that nobody has to listen to the truth. So that nobody has to read the peer-reviewed science. So nobody has to listen to the questions.

The last thing standing between the corporation and that little baby is the mom and the dad. And this greedy industry cannot stand that mother who is going to stop her little baby from being vaccinated. From buying their product and then being hooked for the rest of their lives on Adderal, Epi-Pens, Ritalin, the anti-seizure medications, and the Prozac they get at the back end of this insane industry.

And what do the democrats say? Well, there is no such thing as vaccine injury. It’s all an illusion and these women are hysterical. And they’re so easily deluded. But these women know what happened to their child.

I would say it’s time for the Democratic party to start listening to women. And what happened to the central, fundamental plank of the democratic party? My body, my choice!

And why is our party advocating censorship?

And why is our party in bed with one of the dirtiest industries in the history of mankind?

First, it’s important to know the difference between FDA Approved and FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). No Covid vaccine is FDA approved, they’re only authorized via Emergency Use. How does that effect Ivermectin? Here’s what the [FDA’s website](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization) says about EUA, “FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when certain criteria are met, including there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.”

Ivermectin would classify as an “adequate, approved, and available alternative.” So if they were to acknowledge its potential, it would suspend the EUA for all Covid vaccines.

TheFreeThoughtProject dot com 30 April 2022

Both GR and FTP are BANNED by reddit because...truth can be fucking inconvenient to the establishment)

Despite children facing a near zero chance of dying from COVID-19, the FDA jumped on board and quickly approved Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine for children ages 5-11 last year. Governments across the country then began requiring children to get the jab to go to school as researchers began to see an increase in myocarditis.

Since the vaccine was approved in December 2020, there has been a record number of adverse reactions reported to the CDC and many of them include children. After seeing the increase in adverse reactions, parents of healthy children began to become skeptical of giving their children the jab. But the multi-billion dollar propaganda campaign had already been waged — turning many Americans into rabid pro-vaxxers who wished death and harm on anyone who would dare question their prophets from the book of Big Pharma.

Social media influencers were brought to the White House to convince people to get jabbed. The president himself chastised “anti-vaxxers” wishing them a “winter of severe illness and death,” and Big Pharma propaganda had convinced kids they were “super heroes” for getting the shot.

Those locked into the mass formation psychosis had been put under the spell and companies — with criminally sinister track records — became their new god. Those who didn’t embrace this dogma with all their faith became the enemy — including children.

A tragic case has surfaced out of Chicago this week, highlighting the worst possible scenario of the corporate government’s divisive propaganda that stoked hatred and fear toward vaccine skeptics. According to a lawsuit filed by Robert and Rosellene Bronstein this week, their 15-year-old son was bullied to suicide by teachers and fellow students for not having taken the covid vaccination.

The Bronsteins are not “antivax” and their son Nate was fully vaccinated against covid but once the vicious rumor took hold that Nate was part of the dirty unvaccinated class, a cruel war was waged by the indoctrinated masses.

According to the lawsuit, Nate was “tormented on a regular basis” by other children at the $40,000 per year Latin School of Chicago who claimed that the boy hadn’t been vaccinated against COVID.

Despite more than 30 complaints from Nate’s parents, according to the lawsuit, the school did nothing to stop bullying.

The Chicago Tribune reports:

A student at the school, whose parents are named in the suit, spread a false rumor that the boy was unvaccinated, the suit alleges. Though he was vaccinated, the boy was harassed about his perceived vaccination status, the suit says. The Bronsteins reached out to the student’s family about the alleged harassment, according to the suit.

The bullying escalated from there, according to the lawsuit. He was told by a teacher in front of a class that he was going “nowhere in life,” the suit alleges, and was cyberbullied in a group text message thread by members of the junior varsity basketball team and on the social media app Snapchat. A Snapchat message circulated around the school said of the boy: “Ur a terrible person.”

On Dec. 13, a student sent a Snapchat message to the boy encouraging him to kill himself, the suit alleges.

Likely due to the fact that they believed the rumor too, when Nate reported the students to school staff, they did nothing to stop it. After all, even the teachers were bullying him for it. Despite having anti-bullying policies and a stated “zero tolerance” policy for hate speech, school administrators turned a “blind eye” to the “increasingly desperate” pleas for help from the Bronstein family, according to the complaint.

Upon news of the lawsuit and in spite of the paper trail of complaints, the school refused to acknowledge their role in the child’s death and promised to “vigorously defend itself” from the Bronsteins lawsuit.

“The allegations of wrongdoing by the school officials are inaccurate and misplaced,” a statement from the school read. “The school’s faculty and staff are compassionate people who put students’ interests first, as they did in this instance.”

“My son was so alone,” Rosellene Bronstein, Nate’s mother said in a news release. “Not only were the administrators who were supposed to protect him ignoring his cries for help, but they had the self-serving gall to try to protect their own reputations after his death rather than just having the decency of being honest with his grieving family. This is a legal and moral failure that has caused us indescribable pain and agony.”",conspiracy,big pharma

In addition, a twofold to fivefold increase in the use of antipsychotic medications in **children younger than 6 years** has occurred, despite little information on their long-term effects on child health and the developing brain. Moreover, young children are likely to be receiving multiple psychotropic medications. In one large-scale analysis, almost 80% of preschool children receiving antipsychotic medications also were prescribed other psychotropic medications to manage their symptoms.

220,"I’ve always been pro vax but feel like the biggest chump for getting vaccinated, I feel absolutely duped. It’s so clear it’s all about the money and power now, us vaccine injured are just acceptable collateral in the biggest wealth transfer in history.",440.0,vlmjwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vlmjwq/ive_always_been_pro_vax_but_feel_like_the_biggest/,115.0,1656302677.0,"
I was always left leaning and pro vaccine etc. after experiencing chest pains and the way I/my friends have been discarded and completely brushed off over this, no more. 

I was jabbed 3 times. Since then I’ve been in and out of hospital with chest pains. I have a tiny circle of friends and the mRNA jabs absolutely rocked a few of mine with bizarre immune responses, POTS/chronic fatigue like symptoms  and shingles like rashes. They appear to have similar symptoms to long covid, but from the vaccine itself. 
I also know of a bunch of people in my industry who’ve gone through the same thing, unfortunately I’m in the type of industry where you don’t say shit or you could potentially lose your career and have your personal life in shambles. 

The common theme with all of us? We’ve all been brushed off and told it’s in our head, labelled right wing or anti vax (when we’re jabbed ?!) and completely dismissed. It’s flipped my world on it’s head. It’s made me sceptical of absolutely everything, I hate it, I’m so cynical now. I feel so disgusted by our institutions now, science, which I love, what I (foolishly) thought was bullet proof from corruption has been completely monopolised. 

Suddenly I’m noticing all the topics that aren’t inherently right wing at all (eg: being anti mandate)being labelled right wing and it’s been eye opening, the most effective tool to stop anyone on the centre left who doesn’t agree with what’s going on from talking out. People are simply too afraid to rock the boat and speak up and it’s completely understandable but frustrating. 

I used to see everything as “right wing or left wing” I realise that tribal thinking is what’s wrong with the world. It’s a cancer.  

Look at russel brand, dudes a socialist and all about compassion and empathy for your fellow humans. As left as they come and now he’s being targeted and smeared because he’s speaking up and not holding his tongue anymore. 

It’s almost like all the years of being overly PC, policing peoples speech, thoughts, ideologies etc, has all led to this 

Now the question is, was it all deliberate ? Is there something nefarious going on or did they simply cut corners to rush it to market? I’m leaning toward something more sinister; and it fucking shakes me up to think I’m even saying something like that. 


Anything the media throws the kitchen sink at now, I’m looking. It’s made me question everything I know and was taught, it’s made me see certain polarising political figures that get a bad rep from the media in a different light. 

I no longer subscribe to any beliefs, I take everything with a grain of salt unless it can be 100% confirmed. EVERYTHING 

look at all the fact checkers, have you seen the conflicts of interest with members of the FDA/big pharma/Reuters? It’s so blatant I’m almost impressed, yet you raise this concern and Get labelled it’s absolutely fucking crazy 


 once upon a time I would’ve been hating on putin and throwing all my support at Ukraine, since the pandemic all I see is propaganda and theatre from the political class. Idk what to think. Like It’s all lies. My trust in our institutions has been ruined completely

Sorry if I’m ranting but I could go for days, i feel like neo when he wakes up in the matrix and sees everybody asleep, clueless to what’s going on. I get the red pill analogy, it’s like I’ve woken Up and now I can’t ever go back to how it was.

223,People think that up until now the FDA was trustworthy..here's a list to remind you how corrupt they've always been.,439.0,rm0pww,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rm0pww/people_think_that_up_until_now_the_fda_was/,51.0,1640161535.0,"To preface this, this is just a list of things that have happened in the past with the FDA which have clearly shown conflict of interest/corruption. I should also add there are plenty of things to list for the CDC/WHO as well but I'm pretty sure majority here know them by now (or can look up on their own). 

Without further ado here's a list for you to dig on or just be reminded about how fucked up the FDA has always been: 

1) Oxycontin. FDA had high ranking members closely tied with the executives of Purdue Pharma. In fact some were bought out. Same with the lawyers Purdue Pharma used for so many years as they collected billions from people's medical insurance companies. All the while creating a real pandemic of addiction and death via overdoses. The FDA, despite what many think, turned a blind eye to the reality of Oxycontin until it could no longer be ignored (which by that, I mean the bodies piled up enough and public demonstrations/protests began to get too big to ignore). Imagine this for a second..the FDA knew what was in Oxycontin, they were either completely fucking retarded or willfully ignorant to not give the proper labeling to it (or even have had it tested properly longterm to understand its effects) among many other problems. Purdue Pharma may have declared bankruptcy eventually, but those at the top cashed out high and escaped with little to no punishment. You can thank the FDA for that as well. 

2) Tuskegee Experiments. Look this shit show up for yourself. While many think this was just the CDC's doing, the FDA played a role as well in this. The treatments used were, you guessed it, approved by FDA in similar manner to this jab we have for covid. Emergency use or whatever one wants to call it. Neither the CDC or FDA were held accountable to the lives they ruined, damaged beyond repair and the lives they took in these experiments. We talk about equality and wokeness and political correctness, yet not a damn soul ever mentions this atrocity committed. 

3) HIV/Aids pandemic. Self explanatory for anyone with common sense and critical thinking. Many of the treatments used when AIDs was the fear porn of those days, fucked people up beyond reckoning. It was also theorized (with quite a bit of evidence) that the ""treatments"" would cause it to spread or worsen in a person or someone that infected person came into contact with. Sound familiar to current events at all? Guess who approved these ""treatments"" to the populations in the 80s? Yet another partnership of genocide via the FDA and CDC. Fauci was also very much a part of this one just like he is with COVID as many here know. 

&#x200B;

These 3 are the most recent and in my opinion all that should be needed to reference when speaking to someone about trusting the FDA. They have and always will be corrupt. They do not give a flying fuck about you or me or the children. FDA approval on your glyphosphate cereal with steroid infested milk? Or how about the approval they give to the many poisons sprayed in our air that we get in our lungs, soil and eventually in our crops/water?

At the end of the day, it's just BUSINESS. If anyone needs to look further than the above, they are beyond helping at that point and it is what it is. But for anyone here who thinks for a second, that we can trust the FDA, or any other 3 letter agency, guess again. They will have zero remorse for metaphorically fucking you in the ass without the courtesy of a reach around. Remember that in the days to come. Yeshua bless you all.",conspiracy,big pharma

I grew up extremely pro-vaccines, but the internet has exposed me to some information that seems like an important part of the discussion.

So I'm laying out some of the information I've seen, and the points they bring up.

By re-posting it again here, I'm hoping we can start a conversation about these points. If anybody has any important points they want to include, comment and I'll edit it in. If there is any misinformation mixed in, please help point it out and I'll update the original post with the best info possible. Hopefully we'll all be better informed at the end of this!

**So I want to start off by looking at this Wikipedia article:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical\_human\_experimentation\_in\_the\_United\_States**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)

Just to remind everybody that, when it comes to the US government's, we are dealing with a convicted criminal who has a history of using these types of tactics for unethical ends, by unethical means:

&#x200B;

>[**Unethical human experimentation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation) **in the United States** describes numerous experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have been considered [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics), and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent), or [informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) of the [test subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research). Such tests have occurred throughout American history, but particularly in the 20th century. The experiments include: the exposure of humans to many chemical and biological weapons (including infection with deadly or debilitating diseases), [human radiation experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_radiation_experiments), **injection of toxic and radioactive chemicals**, surgical experiments, interrogation and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_and_the_United_States) experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. **Many of these tests were performed on children,**[**\[1\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Against_Their_Will:_The_Secret_History_of_Medical_Experimentation_on_Children_in_Cold_War_America-1) the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, **often under the guise of ""medical treatment"".** In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.

&#x200B;

With that said, vaccines get a lot of credit for saving millions lives by killing off major diseases including measles, mumps, whooping cough, etc.

**However, the evidence indicates that 90 percent of those diseases were wiped out by the popularization of sanitation, before the vaccines were developed.**

&#x200B;

**National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act legislation (renders manufactures 100% of any & all liability):**

As a result, today if you are harmed by a vaccine, you cannot sue the vaccine manufacturers. They are the only industry protected from liability by the government. If you try to sue a vaccine company, it goes through a separate federal court and you will be paid out by the tax-payers, not by the vaccine manufacturers.

**Unlike a nature measles infection, receiving measles vaccines does not create lifelong immunity, effects wane over time:**

While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.”*

**Japan Leads the Way: No Vaccine Mandates and No MMR Vaccine = Healthier Children**

>*“The U.S. has the very highest infant mortality rate of all industrialized countries, with more American children dying at birth and in their first year than in any other comparable nation—and more than half of those who survive develop at least one chronic illness. No other developed country administers as many vaccine doses in the first two years of life.”*  
>  
>*“Japan initially recommended the HPV vaccine but stopped doing so in 2013 after serious health problems prompted numerous lawsuits. Japanese researchers have since confirmed a temporal relationship between HPV vaccination and recipients’ development of symptoms.”*

It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials.

>*All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis.* Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.

50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair **1** celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. Here are some of them posing for a photo. **2**

**Beth Dozoretz**

Today, Art in Embassies in run by Beth Dozoretz, a close friend of Hillary Clinton and famous for helping Bill Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his final day in office. **1** To quote Vanity Fair, Dozoretz became drew attention to herself when ""she played a key role in persuading her friend Bill Clinton to pardon her fugitive billionaire ex-husband, Marc Rich”. As is the case with most Hillary Clinton confidantes, the more effort they put into covering up international crime and trafficking, the higher they climbed. And even though Hillary’s state department did little to oversee embassies during her tenure as SoS, she still invested a ton of time and effort into promoting Art in Embassies.

**1** ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106 )

Dozoretz has worked with Alefantis before and they are closely linked among the D.C. elite. This shows that Alefantis, at the very least, is closely tied to the center of globalist power in America, and with the podesta brothers & company.

**Skull & Bones, kings of opium and smuggling**

The Art in Embassies program is run by many members/alumni of the Yale circle of elites, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Robert Storr (Dean of Yale School of Art) and many other industrialist families behind some of America’s best-known brands. The Sackler's, the family behind Purdue Pharma (Valium and Oxycontin), clearly took time away from their role as drug-pushers to promote the arts with the global elite. Here they are with their esteemed lapdog Alec Baldwin.

( http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg )

This is an important detail I can’t stress enough. They literally controlled the Opium market with a prescription drug, exactly as the United States did in Afghanistan, all the way back to the era of the Opium Wars in China…which Skull and Bones controlled. Remember, these families are primarily located around connecticut.

The Sacklers, who have coordinated events with James Alefantis, **1** presented medals to Marina Abramovic and Jeff Koons, whose former wife stated that Koons made his Child touch his private area **2** both of whose work have been transported on these aircraft multiple times, some directly through the Tony and Heather Podesta collection. In fact, Podesta “gifted” transported some of Abramovic’s ""bloody"" work to Whitechapel, London, **3** supported in part by the ""UK Friends of the National Museum of Women Artists"". Notice how they conceal their organizations--diplomatic groups functioning within art galleries.

**3** ( http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/terrains-of-the-body-photography-from-the-national-museum-of-women-in-the-arts/ )

The event shows that it’s not simply celebrating art, but actually announcing the sending of the paintings.

>The event marks the beginning of a landmark collaboration between the Sackler and Art in Embassies. In coming years, **the Sackler will host exhibitions of works by contemporary Asian and Asian American artists before their installation by Arts in Embassies at new U.S. embassies overseas.**

Here’s where it gets weirder. Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event. **1** Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes.

Please Note Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

**Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass**

One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.

The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.

>This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain **endangered species or animal products**), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others. **We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.**

While their corporate headquarters are in Manhattan, Masterpiece International has other 'public' locations which are interesting, including West Palm Beach and Miami Beach; places famous for all kinds of ""cargo"" so bypassing security is very convenient for them. 

The founder of this shipping outfit is David B. Epstein (his genealogy is scrubbed as it that of Jeffrey Epstein, so I couldn't see if they might be actually related. Not much about David on the web, but there's this in the public domain. 

( https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx )

When I noticed that Masterpiece International has a business relationship with the largest shipping container firm in the world which is 49% owned by the govt of Israel, then it got interesting. You can see ZIM on this rate increase PDF from Masterpiece Intl:

About ZIM 

( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_Integrated_Shipping_Services )

ZIM is global, even has a port in Turkey

( http://www.zim.com/countrysites/asia/turkey/en-us/pages/aboutzim.aspx )

Information that ZIM moved radioactive remains of WTC and sold this ""steel"" to China had been completely scrubbed, but most people have heard of them because they broke their lease to get out of the WTC before 9/11, losing $50K in the process, which is maredly interesting.

>The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moved their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks (VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001). More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten were still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escaped unharmed. (JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001) 

There's a lot on that topic, but here's a link with documentation

>When ZIM moved out of WTC, an Israeli moving company occupied their floors but escaped unharmed on the big day as well. [How many Muslim owned companies moved out of the WTC complex just before Sept. 11, 2001? 0]

A year later, ZIM was busted with US/Israeli weapons heading to Iran.

So, crime scene evidence, armaments, what else? The closer to the top of the pyramid, the more interconnected it all is. Don't forget that all major art transactions are highly suspect and that ""modern art"" which is a farce, at best, is without value but is great for money laundering. See Miles Mathis excellent paper on this topic here

( http://www.mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf )

Anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?

This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world. If you do not know what the Venice Biennale is, google the logo. Exactly logo to the FBI Boy Lover symbol.

**James Alefantis and the Comet Ping Pong Link**

The Transformer Gallery hosts an annual silent auction, but few have picked up on the detail that every auction requires the transportation of art from another country that we can now know is shipped through diplomatic channels and part of the same larger network of diplomatically-exchanged art. Per the Gallery program:

This is the 13th Annual Auction and a celebration of Transformer’s 15 year anniversary. The Italian Ambassador is our diplomatic chair this year – highlighting year long collaboration with the Italian Embassy in D.C., and artistic exchange with artists and art spaces in Rome and D.C.

From BrightestYoungThings **1**

**1** ( https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/preview-transformers-13th-annual-auction )

>There’s more than 175 works up for silent bidding this year – I think we actually have 190 works! We say this every year – but I truly feel this is our best selection of work up for bidding yet.

For more on James Alefantis and his friends; Google Heavy Breathing, The Apes Band and Pedophilia. 

Be warned, what they say and the images and videos the bands produce are pedophilic in nature and depict torture. Did I mention the main singer of The Apes was a former Special Needs teacher. You can also google her name, I'll let you find it and search her alter-ego drawings of weird creatures. It's as if all of these people were abused in child hood and so too are they doing the same.

**Connection to Skull and Bones**

Alefantis’ connection to Skull and Bones is rather subtle, but it’s telling that all news media has reported Alefantis’ role as an event organizer for this group. This is two-pronged. First, he coordinates events with the Sackler Freer gallery owned by the Opium family. Secondly, regular Comet performer Kid Congo Powers is married to the curator of the Yale University Art Gallery. **1** You know, the former headquarters of Skull and Bones.

**1** ( https://vimeo.com/67959660 )

Kid Congo powers performs with DJ **Baby Alcatraz**, sometimes at Planned Parenthood events. **1** Remember DJ Baby Alcatraz was the one who owned what appeared to be Pizza Map near Marfa. **2** I won't be getting into the details of how perverted these bands are, as that isn't the premise of this post. Do know though, if you google some of these bands do not click tumblr posts of Google+ posts as many lead to boy lover forums and offputting and pedophilic pictures. 

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/F5E0E8a.jpg )

**2** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1647807 )

Kid Congo Powers, former member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, shows a few suspicious habits on his Tumblr. 

( https://imgur.com/a/ip3ZO )

* Making **Erudite references to actual Bavarian Illuminati members and strange comments about the tomb at the Skull and Bones headquarters.**
* Wearing a Bavarian Illuminati-themed Jacket
* Showing up at Transformer auction around ambassadors
* Vampire Teeth, and references to pizza and blood; so not a normal guy. 

We can’t forget Alefantis’ hosting of the Roosevelts and CFR-connected reporters like Wolf Blitzer. **1** A pizza owner who just so happens to know media affiliates for years, who would have thought. The fact that he and Dozoretz are closely linked in hosting these parties, and that major news networks seem just as involved in the afterparties, there’s no question why the entire Beltway wanted to shut this all down.

**1** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770143 )

Note that you see the exact same pattern with Susan Alefantis and the Chris Kloman case. **1** Those who defended Kloman include CFR-connected anchors like Charlie Gibson and Clinton cronies like Ken Starr.

**Uribe and the Colombian connection**

The Colombian ambassador to the United States worked for a law firm that, around the time that Comet Ping Pong first became a household name, became involved in a case of satanic abuse homicide in Bogota. The murder of Yuliana Samboni by Rafael Uribe would not be so intriguing were the diplomatic chair at Alefantis’ 10th annual Transformer Gallery auction not connected to the same law firm as the assailant.

The blog ‘Blueberry Perspective summarizes the link very well. 

>James Alefantis has political ties to the same colombian oligarch family where the rich architect son is involved in a **satanic ritual abuse case** with other people of a rape and murder of a seven year old poor girl, and it's being covered up in the colombian media, and by the colombian police, and colombia is a country that at the same time has the clinton foundation, carlos slim and frank giustra heavily involved in raping the natural resources, fake foundation activities, that all deal with youth and children, and banking regulations, are tied to haiti, robbing oil money killing union leaders and workers rights abuses, running illegal investment slush funds, etc

**Art world connections**

The reason that the wealthy run art galleries is that they have a lot of money and want to engage in improving civic culture. That would be all fine and dandy if nearly every major family involved in the Skull and Bones network seems to have a connection to this Shipping lines. James Alefantis, in a sense, works for the Maccoby family because of their links to the Folgers, one of the families involved in FAPE.

The Folgers are heavily involved in the so-called Skull and Bones power circle, and they share both the credentials of being an early connecticut settler family and having an ancestor who was ambassador to Belgium. Notice Alefantis’ proximity to the Folger family. From this Voat Post:

( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673862 )

>The Folgers, are a secret power elite family since at least the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lee’s mother is Barbara Sue (Bitsy) McElroy.[8] She was the daughter of Harvard’s Neil H. McElroy, former president of the multi-million dollar corporation, Procter & Gamble, and October 9, 1957, appointed President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense. Neil’s grandmother was Mary Camilla Fry of England- baroness, suspected British Knighthood bloodline lineage.[9]

>Neil’s father is financial advisor Lee Merritt Folger– a child sacrifice (Moloch, also spelled Molech) pagan member of the Bohemian Grove.[10] Lee’s father was investment banker, John Clifford Folger (1893-1981), U.S. Ambassador to Belgium (1957-59)- Alfalfa Club.[11] The Folgers are descendants of Peter Folger. Peter was an early 17th century English settler of Martha’s Vineyard.

**Ellen Susman & Pay 4 Play**

Texas Democrat writes to John Podesta asking to be Ambassador to New Zealand after her and her husband donate to HRC. This fits in line with the pay-to-play allegations surfaced by Guccifer 2.0, when he released the ambassador names and the amounts paid to Obama/HRC to get an ambassadorship.

But what’s more interesting is the Ellen Susman sits on the 2015-2016 National Leadership Board of the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.

( http://blantonmuseum.org/national-leadership-board/ http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/well-trod-path-political-donor-to-ambassador.html )

Not everyone wants a gilded posting in a European capital. Ellen Susman, a Texas philanthropist who contributed $100,000 to the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Obama, has alerted people involved in the decision-making of her interest in serving as director of the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, responsible for managing the art collection that hangs in American embassies around the world.

**Amman, Jordan**

But the Transformer gallery not only takes art in from other countries, but also ships the art outward, as well. The presence of art by Matt Sesow, the artist involved in several Transformer auctions and who once painted an uncanny **‘cumpanda’** **1**, was featured in a Jordanian art exhibit. Notice the imagery of the gallery and it’s pederastic “Da Vinci Children’s Exhibition” and the all-seeing eye out front.

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/bdVvSBg.jpg )

An interesting tidbit to add is that a Syrian diplomatic cable showcases one of the Jordanian gallery’s **1** exhibitions (Wikileaks - A Shout Out From My City **2**), and explains that the exhibition occurred under the patronage of the Ambassador to France. What is important to note is that the auction at the Transformer gallery hosted by James Alefantis was always patronized by a guest ambassador, who made a special art donation to the gallery. Is it proof that he’s smuggling children? No. But does it prove that his connections—including to the Rockefeller’s through Luzzatto, to the Rothschilds, to Skull and bones.

**EXTRA INFO**

____

**Historical precedent to Comet Ping Pong -- an 18th century occult club that lured politicians, lobbyists and ambassadors into a web of blood ritual**

Germaine de Staël, was not only connected to major American diplomats, but also to a mysterious building in Switzerland that Tony Podesta seems to be visiting today. Given their current relationship with ambassadors and actual nobility, it is highly plausible that the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are involved in the same type of operation.

**Body**

During the French Revolution, several notable figures at the highest seats of power in Switzerland and France played decisive roles in overthrowing Louis XVI and guillotining the royal family. It's worth knowing that Soros-type bankers still lorded over Europe at the time--after all, this was the age of Rothschild. Jacques Neckar, from Switzerland, was one such rival and became a finance minister under Louis XVI for France. During the revolution, he barely managed to hold France together, but according to Wikipedia, he also helped spark one of the bloodiest days of the Revolution:

>Necker's dismissal on 11 July 1789, provoked by his decision not to attend Louis XVI's speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.

But there's so much more to this. His daughter, Germaine de Staël, was a gifted writer and power player in the French Salons. She would end up being one of Napoleon's sworn enemies as she tried to subvert his power on several occasions. She was also married to the Swedish ambassador in France. While still young, she ran her own salon in Paris with the ambassador, and they quickly gained a reputation as **being a hotspot for the actual Illuminati and Swedenborgian Cult.** Quotes from the book ""Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Stael"" reveal she was known to the American political elite as well.

>Germaine’s salon in the rue du Bac had become a political meeting place for the liberal aristocracy which soon was to carry out the first phase of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morries, a frequent guest, described Germaine to George Washington as “a woman of wonderful wit, and above prejudices of every kind,” and her house as a temple of Apollo.

Evidence also suggests that the Illuminati/Swedenborgians were involved in some bizarre sorcerer deep-state activities, as we see now with Jimmy Savile, 'Especially' Michael Aquino, wikipedia page scrubbed and the 'Podestas' activities.

>[Monsieur de Stael] had also turned to the Swedenborgian sect, was deeply involved in the mysticism of the Illuminati, and indulged in conjuring spirits...In the Age of Reason, at at the court of the enlightened despot Gustavus, two opposed schools of sorcerers and soothsayers were engaged in secret and mortal combat. King Gustavus’ clairvoyant, Miss Arfwedsson, whose oracle he consulted on every important occasion, was all-powerful, but she was decidedly outnumbered by the soothsayers who surrounded the King’s brother, Duke Charles of Sudermania, for whom they predicted a glorious future. Most influential among them was the Duke’s friend, Baron Reuterholm, who, before witnesses, had put the **Duke into a hypnotic trance to make him prophesy the role he was to play in the regeneration of Mankind.**

>Baron de Stael already had attached to his embassy a Swedenborgian named Halldin, whose specialty it was to make spirits appear in mirrors (he thus produced John the Baptist) and **to read the future in books stained with blood.** Under Reuterholm’s influence these innocent pastimes took a more serious turn.

>At one of the seances held in 1790 in Stael’s presence, a medium revealed that Duke Chatlr was “in possession of the truth itself” and that Reuterholm be his only instrument…”Mention of the King was also made; what has been said concerning His Majesty is of great interest but of such a nature that I dare not trust it to my pen.”

They were literally performing mind control/hypnosis to major political figures to help them carry out political goals. This is congruent with allegations of both the CIA and Globalists blackmailing VIP pedophiles to further their aim. What's also interesting is that Le Bac was a favorite among lobbyists, and was actually known to court the most powerful American diplomats at the time. Staël met Jefferson, Washington, Adams; but what's most interesting is that Madame de Staël is (1) in such an identical position to American socialite James Alefantis, who frequently courts ambassadors from his art functions. Think I'm exaggerating? Here he is hosting the Swedish ambassador. **1** Another Transformer event was even held at the French embassy, and Alefantis has helped organize events with actual French nobility. **2** History repeats itself, and there's even MORE proof.

**2** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530742 )

In some amazing coincidence, Stratfor leaks indicate that Tony Podesta was subscribing to Stratfor from a property in Lausanne. **1** Turns out, he's actually connected to Lausanne through his family and through the art world: Several pieces by Giovanni Battista Podesta, one of the purported ""founders"" of Art Brut, appear at the Collection Art Brut, **2** located in a castle in the town called Le Chateau Beaulieu. He is a worshipper of Mammon. **3** If you want a better idea of what art brut is, please look here. **4** Art brut is essentially ""trauma art"", **5** where victims of trauma, including satanist abuse and pedophilia, paint their experiences. I have spoken to actual art brut collectors who have confirmed this, and who have also admitted that many of the artists come from ""transcendental cults"". Also, abuse victim Kim Noble's work is Art Brut. **6**

We also know that Tony Podesta is connected to this Art Brut art movement for three reasons: (1) He opened the **""Art Blu"" café in Venice, where he owns another property, (2)** **1** he owns countless paintings that are or could be deemed Art Brut and (3) **James Alefantis is one of the biggest patrons of art brut on the East Coast, if not America.** And the painters he helps showcase have painted **pedophilia** **2** and **cumpandas** **3** (Matt Sesow, the artist in question, appears to have been a regular at Comet Ping Pong). So what's the big deal with this castle that Podesta is secretly visiting?

* **It's the old home of Jacques Neckar and Madame de Staël.** Literal Illuminati members use to live there and held unimaginable financial power over Europe. Now Tony Podesta is directly involved with visiting the same property as one of the top--if not THE top American lobbyist--in the world.

* **The group at the Chateau Beaulieu appears to be still tied to pedophilia.** 
There is a call to the board at the bottom of the page to go on an excursion ""every leap year"" **1** to Sciacca in Sicily. It's the home of a sculpture garden and art brut artist pictured here. **2** Now it's owned by a **vineyard called Strada Del Vino Terra Sicane.** **This is their logo.** **3** That logo is one we've seen time and again--and yes I am going to make the case that Comet Ping Pong is far, far more than just a one-off fake news hoax. I think it's at the very heart of this organization, whether it be a place to blackmail people or meet secretly with members of the global elite. It's a perfect cover.

We have a mix of Medicare and private insurance, making our health care system one of the most expensive in the world. Some people argue it’s because the US has better service while other state it is because of “Big Pharma” and greed. 

This leads into the argument of big government and higher taxes versus keeping everything private.

>It has disappointed some of us that there is a paragraph in the green platform that says:

>We support the teaching, funding and practice of holistic health approaches and as appropriate, the use of complementary and alternative therapies such as herbal medicines, homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and other healing approaches.

>Many secular voters support the Green Party, and we support a scientific approach. Would you be willing to remove this from the platform and not fund Homeopathic and *traditional medicine?

>And what are your thoughts on the socialist idea (many socialists support you) that workers should own the means of production? Would be willing to set us on a path to reach that goal?

>A: Agree. The Green Party platform here takes an admittedly simple position on a complex issue, and should be improved.

>I agree that just because something’s untested - as much of the world of alternative medicine is - doesn't mean it's safe. But by the same token, being ""tested"" and ""reviewed"" by agencies directly tied to big pharma and the chemical industry is problematic as well. There's no shortage of snake oil being sold there. Ultimately, we need research and licensing establishments that are protected from corrupting conflicts of interest. And their purview should not be limited by arbitrary definitions of what is ""natural"".

>(For a technical discussion about the challenges/limits of health research, see the chapter on research in a book i co-wrote, “Toxic Threats to Child Development: In Harm’s Way” http://www.psr.org/chapters/boston/resources/in-harms-way.html .)

She also seems to believe that there should be no more private schools. The quote below.
> Public education is another example where there has been a complete scam [regarding privatization]--charter schools are not better than public schools--and in many cases they are far worse. They cherry-pick their students so they can show better test scores. The treasure of our public schools system has been assaulted by the process of privatization.

She makes a broad sweeping generalization about all charter/private schools and attacks them for an argument that doesn't seem like it even holds any water. 

I've heard support for her party stems from the fact that we want a third party to get 5 percent of votes in order for them to qualify for federal funding, but I think that's a poor reason to vote just any party in. 

My question then is this: why would Berners support Jill Stein and the Green Party?

7,Is politics based on human trust of opaque hierarchies a dead-end? How do we overcome deception and exploitation when it's formalized as the profit motive which drives our overall economy?,8.0,2tfg17,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2tfg17/is_politics_based_on_human_trust_of_opaque/,38.0,1422038406.0,"[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics): Politics is the practice and theory of influencing other people on a global, civic or individual level. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state.  

If we look at the etymology of the word government it breaks into two pieces: *[govern](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/govern)* - to control, direct, guide, manage + *[mente](http://www.myetymology.com/latin/mente.html)* - derived from the Latin word mente which was derived from the Late Latin word mens (mind; reason, intellect)  

I pointed this out just to clarify what we are talking about, not to say its good or bad. When we are organizing large numbers of people into a system of government this is a voluntary form of mind control, and it just means that we are on the same page so we can function together.  

> organized control over a human community, *particularly a state*.  

This is where I would like to spark some discussion.   

 * Hierarchical structures are based on fundamental inequality and stratification. 
 * The profit motive is the engine of our society, and it is a formalization of deception and exploitation found in nature.
 * The true inner workings of a hierarchy cannot be known because even direct participants cannot know about the layers above them. eg. We don't really know what our boss does, and know even less, the higher up the pyramid we look.
 * Corporations are private hierarchies which we may know even less about. When they are powerful enough, they can conspire with government or corp. hierarchies in private to increase their power and wealth (with personal gain being motive) eg. Regulatory capture: big pharma, big oil, broadcast media etc.
 * We have no way to prove that this is not, or has not always been happening.
 * We have no way to prove that this is not the general mechanism for revolution cycles: that the system collapses over and over under the weight of corruption.
 * We have no way to prove that the violent overthrow of government is not orchestrated by those in power (actually in power) to maintain their power.
 * We have no way to prove that a state is acting for the good of its people, or for the good of private hierarchies who see the state as a tool for controlling masses of people.

The opposite of hierarchy is not anarchy, its network (civil organization). With the internet connecting us all together there is a huge opportunity for mass participation. Blockchain technology allows us to PROVE the state of the system rather than relying on human trust. Bitcoin has replaced the need for a central bank, and its blockchain technology is poised to replace large chunks of government, law and finance.

> Politics is the practice and theory of influencing other people on a global, civic or individual level.

We can rapidly overcome the twisted mess of self-reinforcing patterns of deception and exploitation if we work together as peers on transforming our own culture. I suggest that civil politics based on fundamental equality can be called Open Memetics and the primary motive would be abundance, not profit. Crowd wisdom on a massive scale, properly refined through technology, could obsolete closed-door decision making. 

For more context please see a video I made recently: [CryptoTown Day 2 - Political (Hierarchy) vs Civil (Network) Institutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDwIAHa9ELw&list=PLm_s2wGgBz4jkh80gYaOJExPIWd5yZlsk&index=2)

Please also check out the [CryptoTown Global Consciousness Memeplex](http://i.imgur.com/rebmeKS.jpg) and [CryptoTown.org](http://CryptoTown.org) to get a better idea of Open Memetics.

Two somewhat distinct movements evolved out of the 2008 crisis and the consequent government bailouts, which most people characterized as ""socialism for the rich and capitalism for everyone else"". In response to this, one movement wanted ""socialism for everyone"", the premise being that since corporations could receive bailouts from their friends in government, the common people who had to suffer the consequences of these corporations' decisions should also receive some form of government assistance. On the other hand, the other movement wanted ""capitalism for everyone"" instead, where if the common people had to struggle with economic fluctuation with no big government helping them, the corporations had to do the same. So you had two proposed solutions: extend the bailouts to the common folk, or remove them entirely.

You could roughly identify these movements as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party movement, though it is worth noting that they each also had their fair share of splits and disagreements.

This sort of contention extended far beyond 2008. There is a big movement among democratic socialists to push for universal healthcare that would be funded by the federal government. The Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank, wrote an [article](https://mises.org/wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive) against this, pointing to data that correlated more regulation with rising healthcare prices that protected big pharma monopolies instead.

I would personally liken it to a person struggling against an attacker with a knife, which represents entrenched corporate monopolies weaponizing federal or big government power against the weak. The demsoc would rather we take the knife and use it against the attacker, i.e. using regulatory power to fight the monopolies. On the other hand, the libertarian would favor throwing the knife away, ensuring none of you have access to it so the both of you can have a fair fight with fists.

12,Anyone else think the birth control pill coverage ordered by DHS is a BS political favor?,0.0,j7c7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/j7c7r/anyone_else_think_the_birth_control_pill_coverage/,14.0,1312339682.0,"Let's think about this.  DHS announced that using their newfound powers under Obamacare, they will require all insurance companies to provide female birth control for free (ie. no copay since it will be a ""preventative"" service).

Let's think about this.

Here are a few facts (Source: http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html)

* Overall, 62% of the 62 million women aged 15–44 are currently using a [contraceptive] method.

* Almost one-third (31%) of these 62 million women do not need a method because they are infertile; are pregnant, postpartum or trying to become pregnant; have never had intercourse; or are not sexually active.

* Thus, only 7% of women aged 15–44 are at risk for unintended pregnancy but are not using contraceptives.

* Among the 43 million fertile, sexually active women who do not want to become pregnant, 89% are practicing contraception.

Now, this regulation only covers people who have insurance.  So statements like this (from CNN at http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/01/free.birth.control/)

> Supporters also say covering contraception helps the government save money up front. According to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, in 2006, of the 2 million publicly funded births, 51% resulted from unintended pregnancies, accounting for more than $11 billion in costs.

Are purely false.  Publicly funded births are for people without insurance.  This regulation is for people WITH insurance who are making an active decision to not purchase a prescription due to a co-pay.

So let's look even deeper.  Basically, DHS was so concerned about whatever percentage of that 7% mentioned above has insurance but is scared by a $20 co-pay?  Really?  To prevent pregnancies?  I don't buy it.

What they have done is hand big-pharma one hell of a check.  How are insurance companies supposed to negotiate rates when they are *required by law* to cover the drugs?  They can't.  The entire cost of birth control now sits on the shoulders of employers and not the employee at all.  This is a huge shift in wealth away from employers and away from insurance companies to workers and big-pharma......both large donators to President Obama's campaign.

In fact, Big Pharma donated $2.3m to Obama vs $700k to McCain (Source: http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=H04&cycle=2008&recipdetail=P&mem=N&sortorder=U)

The major effect of this regulation is not on the 7% of women not using a form of birth control, but on the employers and insurance companies that now must pay 100% of the cost of those drugs for 100% (that's over 10x of 7%) of their employees.  Not to mention, since the cost is spread out among all employees, men are now suddenly paying for some other woman's birth control!  And of course, insurance premiums will skyrocket from this because they need to cover the hard cost of the drugs.  There's no way to avoid it.

It all smells to me and looks like one big Democrat Party Favor to Pharmaceutical manufacturers.  It's one of the most politically motivated regulations I have ever seen.  It's the kind of thing that is exactly why having government involved in business is not a good idea.

**tl;dr - Required coverage of birth control is a huge wealth transfer from employers and insurance companies to workers and big pharma (IE:  Republican interests to Democratic ones).  Oh, and you're helping pay for every woman's birth control at your office even though you aren't getting any.**

I'll explain.
 
If you legalize everything, and make available all drugs to everyone over the age of 21, then you eliminate the persuasion pharmaceutical companies have over doctors.
 
When I say legalize everything, I mean you have stores that are just pharmacies and that's it, not what CVS and the like are, it would have just drugs in it.  These stores would be smart to have superior pharmaceutical experts (Doctor level Pharmacists on-site) to attract business much more than today due to what would be many more options for the customer.
  
You can make it 21+ to enter if you want, but you have everything available, over the counter, without prescription. Any smart person would go to the doctor, or a medical professional for a diagnosis, and a suggestion for which medicines to purchase.
 
Pharmaceutical companies currently wine and dine, push and persuade doctors to prescribe their products... and many doctors comply with them almost to a fault. If we had the freedom to buy whatever we wanted, which is currently impossible, pharmaceutical companies would no longer have any reason to pay or persuade doctors, they would be dealing strictly with customers. Pharmaceuticals already spend insane money on advertising, I am sure they would prefer that the people they are advertising to can have the choice to buy their products, creating even more revenue than currently.
This would also allow for a robust and possibly better market for drug safety, quality, consumer relations, consumer advocates, etc.. 
Most importantly, this would remove pharmaceutical companies persuasions from the doctors decisions almost all together, leaving only the best medical advice the doctor has to give for the patient (which is all there should to begin with)
 
Any idiot would also have the ability to walk into the store and buy something that reacts with another drug they are taking, and end up killing themselves. They'd even have the option to buy drugs that could kill them all by itself in one try.
 
That's how freedom works... for the smart, and the stupid, equally.
 
It would end the war on drugs, it would improve drug research and therefore drug quality, it would enable doctors to worry about helping their patients instead of pleasing the pharmaceutical companies, and the pharmaceutical companies would be forced to place reasonable prices on their products, but also make more money by having a larger market, and even possibly having their own stores.
 
Combine all that with the hopefully eventuality of universal health insurance, and you are talking top quality, highly competitive, safer drugs at reasonable prices, busy doctors helping the smart and repairing the injured (and the stupid), profitable pharmaceutical companies competing in an actual, real, open market, and a bunch of new jobs on top of all that.

industry truly advocate for a free and open internet? What kind of conflict of interest presents
itself when legislators, whose campaigns are funded by manufacturers of war machines, are
charged with deciding whether or not to send our sons, daughters, mothers, fathers and friends
off to war?

It is unconscionable that corporations and the wealthy elite get to decide how our society treats
its citizens and write the rules for how we are governed. I decided I had to join the fight to end
corruption several years ago when I left my teaching career to lead Wolf-PAC, a national
organization whose sole priority is to end the undue influence of money in politics.

After the 2016 election I realized that my work with Wolf-PAC wasn’t enough. So, l decided to
run for U.S. Senate against Dianne Feinstein who has been one of the most conservative
Democrats in one of the most progressive states in the union for 26 years.
I immediately signed on to run as a Justice Democrat upon announcing my candidacy. The
most important and unifying component of all Justice Democrat platform priorities is a **pledge
to refuse corporate and dark money**. We also believe healthcare is a human right, that we all deserve equal pay for equal work, and that our corrupt government must return to one of, by
and for the people.

Since my candidacy announcement in November, I have been overwhelmed with support, not
just from Californians, but from citizens all over the country who believe we can design the
country we dream of. At Wolf-PAC I managed tens of thousands of volunteers and I’m glad I did
because this grassroots campaign relies on volunteers who stand up and say “enough is
enough.” I am proud to say I have a growing network of more than 1,500 volunteers who are
[canvassing, phone banking, setting up events and supporting me](
https://www.alisonhartson.com/volunteer) on social media and on the ground.

I am also grateful that our grassroots, corporate-free campaign message is resonating. I lead all
of my opponents in [small-dollar donations](https://www.alisonhartson.com/donate) in the final
quarter of last year, many of which are from people who are also volunteering.

To me, all of this means that we are ripe for change in this country. We are **done** with
establishment politics and the status quo. We are prepared to take back our government.

19,"The Washington Post and New York Times cite a stubborn fact: Hillary is the only candidate from either party taking large sums of money from Wall Street, big Pharma, fracking interests, for-profit prisons, ..., while purporting to rein in those industries.",4666.0,47y3gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47y3gf/the_washington_post_and_new_york_times_cite_a/,348.0,1456608165.0,"Hillary defends her transcript silence as defending against a double standard since other candidates have not released transcripts.   This self-post highlights the absurdity of Hillary's argument.

The [New York Times editorial board](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/opinion/mrs-clinton-show-voters-those-transcripts.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&smtyp=cur) and a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/the-new-york-times-just-perfectly-explained-why-hillary-clintons-answers-on-her-paid-speeches-dont-work/) have both called on Hillary to release the transcripts.

The central idea of the Washington Post and New York Times articles is that Hillary is the only candidate trying to have it both ways and so there is no double standard.   

**Hillary is the only candidate from either party taking large sums of money from Wall Street, big Pharma, fracking interests, for-profit prisons, ..., while purporting to rein in those industries.**

The Republicans have consistently voiced and voted support for Wall Street so what value would there be in them releasing a speech that confirms their stated views?   

Bernie Sanders has already released his transcripts: there are none.   Hillary clings to the thin fiction that Bernie has indirectly taken money from Wall Street through the DSCC.   Her $200K estimate is an order of magnitude too high, but even if true is still an indirect payment almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than Hillary's payment.

And, what is said for Wall Street goes for for-profit prisons, fracking, keystone pipeline, ...   The Republicans openly embrace these industries so there's no news value in them giving a private speech in favor of these industries.

Another indicator that Hillary's speeches were pre-payment for services to be rendered is the report that [Hillary's standard speech fee was 500% of the standard rate for ex-secretaries of state](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-c-frank/sanders-shatters-clintons_b_9276584.html).   In other words, her payments were adjusted upwards to factor in Hillary's status as a Presidential contender.

Hillary must release not only the full Wall Street speeches (including Q and A), but must do so for all the industries to whom she gave paid speeches.",politics,big pharma

 - Ban Members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks, restrict the revolving door of lobbyists working in the Capitol, and end dark money and corporate campaign contributions.

AMA!",603.0,fx8ajy,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fx8ajy/im_russ_cirincione_a_new_deal_democrat_for/,546.0,1586359143.0,"I have a few questions for everyone: How can Americans have peace of mind, if our government isn’t protecting us from pandemics and the climate crisis? Can you imagine how much happier everyone would be if all basic, human needs were guaranteed as rights? Also, are you doing ok in this national emergency? Please DM me if you think I could help, even if it's just to listen. 

About me: I’m 32 years old, a government attorney, and a dad. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to my son’s life and his future. We have ten years to clean up our world and it’s now or never. My home will flood twice a month by 2035. A new gas pipeline is proposed a few miles from my house. The fossil fuel companies will not stop until every ounce of oil on this planet is burned. They have come for my family – and they’ve messed with the wrong father.

I support the Green New Deal to protect our homes and our families. The federal jobs guarantee will create millions of good jobs, even during national crises like this one.

For four years I’ve been a public servant, an attorney for housing justice, for New York State government. Last year I helped draft a law to protect ~200,000 people in manufactured homes, mostly seniors. We banned unfair evictions and banned fraudulent lenders. I also defend the Rent Stabilization Law in court. I support rent stabilization and housing for all because no one should be homeless.

As an organizer and activist, last year alone, one movement I volunteered for blocked wall street from purchasing up a local town’s water supply, and another required a local town to buy 100% renewable energy. I’ve learned that even small changes make a big difference, and every fight counts. But it takes armies of ordinary people to effect it.

The system is rigged for the top 1%. Billionaires buy elections, mega corporations crush out small businesses, they buy tax loopholes, they pay less tax than working people, and they get so many government handouts. The main reason our government doesn’t work is because of the money in politics. We have to ban lobbyists, ban private donations, and switch to publicly financed elections. If we get the money out, it’s the reform of all reforms.  

That’s why I’m committed to never take a penny of corporate PAC money, nor lobbyist money. One cannot have two masters, it’s either the money, or the People, and I choose the People.

I’m a New Deal Democrat. I want to guarantee you and your family peace of mind in a chaotic world with basic economic rights. Healthcare as a right with Medicare for All. A UBI (with no strings attached). We need to rethink our food system, ban factory farms, increase food inspections, indoor vertical farms for organic food at cost. We’ve got to end the scam of student loan debt, college should be free. I want to expand social security to be enough to retire on. I want to end endless wars overseas.

I'm running in the Democratic Primary for New Jersey's 6th Congressional District (Middlesex and Monmouth Counties) . 

The incumbent Democrat I’m running against, Frank Pallone, has been in office for 32 years, and he’s powerful. As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he could call a vote on almost any bill. He’s sponsored by millions from big pharma and insurance, so of course he blocks Medicare for All (HR 1384). He takes millions from fossil fuel companies, so of course he thinks the Green New Deal is unfeasible. Well, I think it’s mandatory. His “Clean Future Act” is corporate socialism–Americans would pay the price to build fossil fuel pipelines, until 2050. This is failed leadership and it’s 20 years too late. I’ve been waiting for real, meaningful change my whole life. The time is now.

I hope you join our campaign! We’ve raised about $25,000 from an average donation of $26, and we’re seeing our lowest numbers these past few weeks. So I really need your help!

Does this mean that if we start a petition to legalize ripping off the entire country the DOJ will raid Wall street?


Probably not but it does illustrate that the opinions of the people do not matter to the Obama administration.

######### UPDATE ##############

Apparently it is not clear to everyone that my comment was intended to be sarcastic. To clear things up, no i do not believe that a petition to legalize financial crimes would cause the DOJ to raid wall street. I also have no proof that the petition had anything to do with the recent attention the DOJ is paying to the states where marijuana is legal. I just think that it is interesting that they decided to step up the attacks on dispensaries a few weeks after the petition got a bunch of press.

My honest opinion is that it is unrelated, and the real reason is that they are clearing the way for big pharma to give patients a THC pill that they can patent  because the FDA is now considering reclassifying marijuana to  schedule 3.    ",politics,big pharma

138,I am truly finished with the Democratic party for the foreseeable future.  I'm convinced that a vote for a third party would be less of a waste.,144.0,l7skm,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l7skm/i_am_truly_finished_with_the_democratic_party_for/,266.0,1318299188.0,"The only way to show Democrats that they can no longer favor big business over the American people is to vote third party.  Not voting all together isn't good enough.  You MUST vote third party to show them they are losing an active voter.  If you continue to vote for them as usual, they will continue their policies as usual.  It is that simple.    

While I still consider them to be the lesser of two evils, I can no longer justify voting for them.  I will do research on third party candidates before the election, and I will vote for the one I most agree with.  

**Before you say I am wasting my vote.**  I truly believe you cannot make that argument anymore.  My vote for Obama was a wasted vote.  Your vote was as well if you are disappointed with how things turned out.  

The point that is very obvious to me right now is this:  we cannot expect the Democratic party to bend to our will (and away from big business and special interests) if they can keep our vote after doing NOTHING substantial in the past few years.  The healthcare bill was a handout to health insurance and Pharma.  Dodd-Frank did not end Too Big To Fail.  I can promise you I did not vote for this.

You can make all of the excuses you want, but the bottom line is that the Democrats had a mandate to bring real change to Washington and America at large, and hardly anything changed.  They couldn't be too forceful without hurting their campaign contributions, and obviously they chose their jobs over bringing actual improvement to our country.

While it may put a Republican in the White House in 2012, it would also send a very loud message to Democrats that their old way of doing things wasn't working.  That might actually have a shot at bringing actual change, as opposed to rewarding them for doing a miserable job. ",politics,big pharma

Hillary has taken money from big-pharma, private prisons, crooked media conglomerates, and more. Hillary will not make decisions for the people, or for the country. She only cares about herself and her legacy. She will do nothing- and still go down in history as the first female president.
