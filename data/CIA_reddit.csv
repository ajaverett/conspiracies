1,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15933.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

Page 34

-	Jane Doe 3 and 4 can’t join under rule 21, rule 15 is the proper procedure. 

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

under rule 20

-	Rule 15 covers these types of situations so rule 21 is denied.

Page 38

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

intervention.

-	Motion doesn’t show why addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is now necessary to “vindicate their 
rights as well”.

P., which provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in violation of Rule 33

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

-	Cannot remember where he was when he prepared statement but did it January 2, 2015,

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

Page 223

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 

(Missing pages)

Page 225

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him?

Oh, and before you say ""he's gotta enforce the law,"" remember this: theres so much laws being broken, and precious few resources.

15,2 years of compiled research available as PDF download or video format proves Pizzagate is 100% real. I have enough evidence for law enforcement in America to open up a real investigation.,6237.0,hn7crw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hn7crw/2_years_of_compiled_research_available_as_pdf/,1113.0,1594170479.0,"**EDIT: I don't have time to reply to everyone right now, but I will be leaving a detailed reply very soon. I will link in the comments. All you shills have zero effect on me. Keep drinking your cognitive dissonance cocktails.**

**Website:** [**www.seanspeaks.co.uk**](https://www.seanspeaks.co.uk) 

Hello people of the world. My names Sean. I am in investigative journalist who has covered Pizzagate extensively for the past 4 years. For anyone new to this subject, **pizzagate is about the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children in Satanic Rituals.** Its crazy how John Podestas leaked emails lead to this dark, satanic, pedo underworld where they do all this horrible stuff to kids. This scandal broke in November 2016 right before the presidential election. Since that day a massive disinformation campaign has been initiated to shut down all discussions of Pizzagate online. The Government and controlled Zionist mainstream media have done a fantastic job at completely discrediting the story without acknowledging any of the facts.

I have created this content in a easy, informative manner, to take the viewer on the same journey I did. **Caution: If you go down this rabbit hole it will completely change your perspective on life and the world around you.** Once you fully come to terms with what Pizzagate is actually about, it turns your stomach sick and compels you to do something about it.

Pizzagate is a giant jigsaw puzzle. When looking into this subject you need to treat it as if you were a detective investigating a crime. You would look at all the evidence to determine if the people implicated are involved in criminal activity or not. Pizzagate is an accumulation of circumstantial evidence which leads to one logical conclusion. **Serious corruption at the highest echelons of Government involving the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children.** The state will do anything, and everything in their power to stop this story from being fully understood by the public.

The evidence I have put together for you proves, without a shadow of a doubt, Pizzagate is real. It proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that law enforcement in the US must open up an investigation into Pizzgate immediately. **To be clear, that is what we need. A real investigation for trained professionals within the law.** This is not something people like me or you should be doing online. I have created my work this way so no one can argue and call it ***""fake news""***, or a ***""conspiracy theory"".*** My content is truthful, factual, and legitimate. End of story.

Once you fully understand the severity of this scandal. What you do about it is down to you. If you want to take a stand and fight back, for the sake of all the innocent children, then share this document far and wide. Share my videos on as any social media platforms as possible. Send my documents into law enforcement in you really want to. Call politicians, do something. We cannot sit back and allow this to go on any longer. If theres one thing we can all agree on, regardless our political or religious beliefs, of even the colours of our skin, **ITS THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN.**

Please help me wake as many people up as possible to the dark, sinister truth, which is Pizzagate. My presentation is part or the larger compendium which is called **#FREEDOMGATE.**  Freedomgate is my creation. Its a movement that all people of the world can get involved with for free. Freedomgate is about liberation, revolution, and freedom, for the entire human race. Full details can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate\_the\_revolution\_of\_the\_human\_race\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate_the_revolution_of_the_human_race_is/)

Please view my work in your own time. I just want to say that I love every single one of you who are out there fighting the good fight. We all just need to stick together, ride the wave, and see where it takes us. Thank you for reading. I appreciate you being here.

But what if I told you he's still alive and well.

Let's look at one of Elvis Idols, his name is Tom Jones, his very close friend. He was born in 1940.

Tom looks good yeah?  This is to show age doesn't matter. 

Here's the weird thing when I was a active member of above top secret  a long while back we had a post about this after the CIA released files about Elvis being a mafia snitch and faked his death. 

The OP of the original thread on AboveTopSecret is on this sub u/kleverone so credit to you. 

Then we found this guy. https://youtube.com/user/JonCotner1835

Nothing weird right? They did voice analysis either this guy's a modern day Elvis or a genius. It gets deeper. Lisa Marie presley in the past has answered back in these videos.

what's even weirder we found a picture of said Jon cotner and we did some analisys.

[Eye indentation comparison ](https://i.imgur.com/Zh9awWP.jpg)

We found his left eye above as the exact same eye scar.  Same birthmark as Elvis.

What's fucked up is there was a video of Lisa Marie leaving a restaurant in France (could be incorrect on the location was a long time ago) and Jon cotner was behind her it's been edited since I've first saw it. Now edited in. 


Here is where it got even weirder there was a film called finding Graceland in 1994 https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0120026/ a film about people believing Elvis is still alive. Guess who's a producer  yup Priscilla Pressley.

18,I've researched the afterlife for nearly 10 years. I am convinced that Reptilian beings are REAL and that the tunnel of light that people see when they die is a trap.,5976.0,pyizkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pyizkn/ive_researched_the_afterlife_for_nearly_10_years/,1985.0,1633005788.0,"**Introduction**

For the last 10 years, I have been researching the nature of our reality, who or what controls our society from the shadows, and more importantly what actually happens when the physical body dies and the soul leaves the body. Do we go to heaven? Do we go to hell? Do we just cease to exist? Is there a God that takes care of us? Once you begin to realize what's actually going on and how deep the rabbit hole really goes, you will never see the world in the same way so buckle up and get ready, this is not going to be easy to swallow for most people. The whole point of this post is not to frighten you, but to present you the conclusions that I've come to in regards to what actually happens when our physical bodies die after having done what feels like endless research from every angle possible.

I have thoroughly investigated near death experiences, out-of-body experiences, astral projection experiences, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data, gnosticism, ancient texts and more. I cannot say I know with absolute certainty what happens when we die, but what I do know is that all these different ways/methodologies of researching lead to the same conclusions and because of that, I believe that Earth is a prison planet and a massive farm used by various parasitic entities who are using us and have been using us as energetic food for what appears to be a very long time. I will share plenty of evidence from different sources and perspectives to make you understand how I connected all these dots and why I came to these conclusions. I promise you that the deeper you research this stuff the more you will begin to realize that this is extremely real, important, and it's possibly affecting every single one of us. All I'm asking you is to keep an open mind and to analyze the evidence yourself. 

Different sources that have nothing to do with each other indicate the same scenario, so what I'm about to explain below is the conclusion of all these sources. I listed all the sources at the end of the post. This post isn't necessarily about what one person is saying, it's about what the evidence is showing.

**Reincarnation and the white tunnel of light**

You know how anyone who's had a near death experience talks about having seen a tunnel of light appear in front of them? Or having met members of their family who had passed away? In some rare cases, even having met and spoken to who they thought was God? My research suggests that the tunnel of light which appears when we die is a trap designed to wipe the whole memory of our last incarnation and to recycle our souls into another body thus keeping us in an infinite loop here on Earth. Because of this, the overwhelming majority of people walking the Earth have total amnesia and don't remember anything about their past existences nor anything from the periods in-between their lives. If you do some research though, you will notice that there is however a small number of people world-wide who are able to recall very specific details regarding who they were, what they did for a living, where they lived in a past life, etc([evidence 1](https://youtu.be/9w2MCpzE8u0?t=60),[evidence 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcsqOBUdK28),[evidence 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is),[evidence 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ty-TdWKM0)). 

How do we know these people aren't making up their stories? There's lots of people out there who have been able to bring very solid pieces of evidence to sustain their claims and those claims can be verified([verified evidence 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnXxC-nVsJY&t=8s),[verified evidence 2](https://yogaesoteric.net/en/definite-evidence-and-maybe-even-proof-of-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 3](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140521/lifestyle-offbeat/article/3-yr-old-recalls-past-life-murder-identifies-killer-and-locates-his/),[verified evidence 4](https://newspunch.com/scientific-breakthrough-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 5](https://infinityexplorers.com/the-reincarnation-of-shanti-devi-the-girl-who-identified-her-previous-life-family),[verified evidence 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is&ab_channel=ThingsAreChangingProductions)) which shows that reincarnation is a very real phenomenon,  despite what some of the world's religions claim to happen to the soul when a person dies. The reason these people's memories have only been partially erased and not fully erased remains unknown for now.

The reason people that went through NDE's didn't come back with their memories wiped is because unlike people who have died, they didn't end up going all the way through the tunnel of light to reach it's destination, many NDE'rs didn't enter the tunnel at all, while some have partially experienced it. All of them managed to return to their bodies and lived to tell what they experienced on the other side, hence the term 'near death experience'.

**The astral(spirit) realm, the reptilians and their agenda**

The Reptilians are found in the literature of multiple ancient cultures across the globe. Jainism and Hindu talk about the 'NAGA' whom they describe as 'half-human half-serpent deities'. The aztecs used to worship the 'Quetzalcoatl' whom they described as the ""serpent-like God"". The Hopi Indians in North America referred to a race of reptoids called the 'Sheti', translated ""Snake-Brothers"". In Africa, shamans claim to bear extensive esoteric knowledge of a race of reptilian beings called the Chitauri, whom they say control the Earth. Chinese, Korean and Japanese legends talk about a race of reptilian beings called the ""Kappa"". The Gnostics talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use humans as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies.

[The Reptilians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEMXvjv0M2E&ab_channel=TheInternationale) are both physical and astral beings. They've been heavily involved in the manipulation of mankind for thousands of years and are responsible for setting up [the soul trap around the planet](https://humansbefree.com/2015/07/soul-catching-net-we-are-recycled-at-death-to-remain-in-the-matrix.html) with the help of extremely advanced technology. This energy grid around the planet serves multiple purposes, one of it's main purposes is to project this 'grandiose' tunnel of light in the proximity of people who have just died in order to lure their souls in. This is the same tunnel of light that so many people who've had near death experiences have reported seeing on the other side. The soul may be under the impression that the tunnel is going to take it to the Heavens or perhaps to a higher plane of existence, depending on it's level of awareness. In reality, when a soul enters the tunnel, it's memory gets wiped and the soul is put into another body here on Earth(reincarnation).  The tunnel acts as a bait and to make a good analogy, imagine a fisherman and his fishing rod: he throws in the bait which hides the hook and the fish get trapped in it when they bite. We get tricked and trapped by the tunnel of light in a similar way if we aren't aware that it is a trap. In this case, we're the fish. The Reptilians are highly intelligent, highly advanced technologically and they lack empathy which makes them dangerous. These beings see themselves as 'Gods' and humanity as their enslaved cattle.

The reason they want to keep us here is because they need to feed off of us energetically: when people go through any kind of suffering, these entities feed off of our lower frequency emotions such as fear, pain, grief, anger, jelousy, rage, anxiety, lust, because they are low vibrational beings that require low vibrational energy in order to survive. Rudolf Steiner, one of the most prolific and gifted scientists, philosophers, and esotericists of his time [explains how the Archons feed off of our fear and anxiety](https://www.shiftfrequency.com/steiner-describes-archontic-parasites/).

The majority of people living on this planet today have been continously reincarnating on this planet for thousands of years because we keep falling for the same trap when our physical bodies die. Most of us have no memories of our past existences since our memories get wiped before every reincarnation, so every time we are born on this planet we think we've just arrived for the first time with a grand purpose or mission to fulfill given to us by who we think is God. 

> ""*Our consciousness interacts with another dimension. Our physical sensors only show us a 3-dimensional universe. What exists in the higher dimensions are entities we cannot touch with our physical sensors*""  - **Bernard Carr**, professor of mathematics and astronomy who studied under Stephen Hawking and earned his doctorate at Cambridge.

When our physical bodies die or when we have an out-of-body experience, our soul goes into the astral(spirit) realm and while we can still observe what's happening on Earth but we can no longer interact with physical matter. These parasitic entities exist mainly but not exclusively in the astral plane. It's crucial that we become aware of the fact that these entities who are masters of deceit play 'God' in order to trick us into accepting reincarnation and thus having our memories wiped, convincing us that it's in our best interest to do so. 

How are they able to do that, you may ask? When we're out of our bodies the laws of physics as we know them no longer have the same effects upon us as we find ourselves in a different realm in which we are able to do things that would be impossible in the physical world. Our souls are pure energy, so in the astral/spirit realm, we can change the shape of our astral body(spirit) into anything we want by simply willing it to happen because unlike in the physical world, we can use our consciousness to manifest a different looking body in an instant when we're in the astral plane, since we are no longer affected by physical laws and limitations. We can also fly around or teleport by simply using our intention to do so. We can even go to higher vibratory realms(where the real good-hearted beings live) if our vibration is high enough.

> ""*If you want to find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration*"" - **Nikola Tesla**

If you understand that in the astral, any entity can change the shape of it's astral body into anything it wishes to, then you realize that even the most malevolent entity possible can present itself to you in a different form to trick you into thinking you're speaking to God or to your guardian angel, or even to one of the members of your family who had passed away. They do this because they know you'd put your trust in these religious figures or in the familiar faces and once they gained that trust they can easily manipulate you into doing things that are not in your best interests at all. They masquerade as 'beings of light' that emanate a fake sensation of love and peace to make you think they're the good guys who are there to guide you and to give you your next ""mission to fulfill"".

This is mentioned even in the bible:

> ""*And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light*"" - **II Corinthians 11:14**

---

**Afterlife tricks & scams**

If you don't enter the tunnel of light when your time comes, you need to be aware that these entities will present themselves to you in the form of angels/Jesus/God/saints/guides/ascended masters/guardian angels and they're going to try to convince you that you need to go back to Earth so you can pay back your ""karmic debt"" or to continue ""learning"" or that you have to go back with a ""special mission to fulfill"" which is complete bullshit but we keep falling for these scams because they tend to make sense from our narrow and pre-programmed perspectives(good luck fulfilling that ""special mission"" if you can't remember what the ""mission"" was). We put blind trust in what they say to us because of constant religious indoctrination during our lives on Earth and these beings know that.

They can't force us to reincarnate because each soul has free will, but they can pretend to be someone they're not in order to put ideas in our head that it's in our best interest to accept reincarnating back on Earth making it sound as if they are doing us a favor so that we can ""evolve"", ""learn"" or ""fix previous mistakes"" and what they're basically doing is they're using our own free will against us. The real purpose of continuous reincarnation is soul enslavement disguised as ""spiritual evolution"". [A free will decision is impossible without memory and information](https://humansarefree.com/2018/03/saying-no-to-reincarnation-and-regaining-your-freedom.html).

Because our memories are being wiped after each life time, many of us live under the illusion that we're currently living our first life on this planet and we came here to ""learn"". Learning about life on Earth and experiencing it would be useful if we didn't lose our memories after each life time. But it doesn't matter what we learn over here as long as everything gets erased after each reincarnation and we have to relearn everything from scratch over and over again in an endless loop. Earth is a prison planet camouflaged as a 'cosmic school'. This idea of a cosmic school has been going around in order to trick souls into wanting to come and stay here in order to ""learn"". This whole [matrix](http://howtoexitthematrix.com/2017/06/20/what-is-the-matrix-and-how-do-we-exit-from-it/) is designed to drain our energy, wipe our memories over and over again and keep us trapped.

Many people that went through near death experiences even recall being accompanied by a ""loving"" angel who showed them their life review. The reason the entities show us life reviews is so we can relive certain moments from our lives in which we made certain mistakes and by reliving those moments, feelings of guilt, shame and remorse are being generated inside of us, making us want to compensate for them. These beings then use these feelings against us telling us things such as: ""You have made these mistakes, you have to go back to fix this and that"". Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes, so their emotional manipulation scam will never end if you buy into it because being human it's impossible to not make what we perceive to be humanly mistakes. [This NDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulN1vUayvM&ab_channel=NearDeathExperiences) for example shows how one woman is shown not one **but two fake life reviews** in order to convince her to go back.

**""New Age"" believers who promote calling upon ""your"" spirit guides, guardian angels, ascended masters and religious figures for help,  are actually doing huge damage to themselves and to all of humanity and they are not even aware of it. You are everything you need to succeed. You are a powerful creator being and you don't need to give your power away to anybody**.

**How they're using your religious beliefs against you**

Religion has programmed you to believe that at the moment of your death, a spiritual judgement type of scenario will take place(the biblical Judgement) and it will be expected of you to give your authority away to these beings (God,angels,guides) letting them decide your fate, so that when your time actually does come, you won't even question these beings and what they are doing with you, instead you will simply accept whatever they ask from you because everything will seem to be going as planned, since that's what religion programmed you to believe will happen when your physical life will end.

These entities take advantage of the fact that you have been continuously conditioned to believe in an afterlife saviour who will take you to the Heavens if you're a good boy. Even if you're an atheist, when you see this ""God"" or ""Jesus"" figure right there in front of you in the astral, you may start to have second thoughts about what you thought about religion back on Earth and you will most likely end up accepting what these entities want you to do because your perception of reality can change in an instant in a shocking and surprising scenario like that. 

Religion has also given you the sense of being a guilty sinner who has to worship, obey and pray to a certain God(depending on your religion) in the hopes of afterlife salvation. The real salvation is not coming from the parasitic entities who pretend to be our creators, it is coming from ourselves. In order for this to happen, we have to become aware of what actually awaits us when we die so we can use our free will to put an end to this vicious reincarnation cycle. 

The real, powerful, infinite, creator God (who has nothing to do with any religious movement) is already within you. You are Source energy. We are the saviours we have been waiting for and we don't need to give our power away to anybody.

Think about this: if you're born somewhere in Europe/North America/South America for example, then the main religions of those areas tell you that God put you on this Earth to live your life and at the end of that life, there will be judgement. God will then decide whether you'll go to Heaven or Hell, for eternity. But, what if you're born in other areas of the world such as the Middle East? or India? or any country/region in which the main religion is either Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism? These religions teach that after death there is reincarnation, no heaven no hell. So why is it that the place we're born in on this planet dictates a certain belief in something so important such as our existence beyond physical life? Will random luck really going to dictate what's going to happen to each one of us at the moment of our death? Will each one of us have a different afterlife fate just because we're born in different places around the world? It is all part of their game of deception, but the more you expand your awareness the easier you can see through the lies and deceit of the social and religious programming that we've all been through one way or another.

**Why is Source energy/the creator of this Universe allowing all this to happen?**

Each being in this Universe, whether malevolent or benevolent, has free will. Ask yourself: why are we humans allowed to enslave the animals here on Earth? [Why are we allowed to slaughter more than 3 billion animals on a  **daily** basis?](https://sentientmedia.org/how-many-animals-are-killed-for-food-every-day/) Why are we allowed keep animals locked up in farms and cages until the day they die? Why are we allowed to be so cruel to the other forms of life? Why? Because we, just like these entities do, have free will. From our perspective, we do these things because we need something from them which is energy in the form of physical food. We think we are entitled to do what we do because we are superior to them and because we need to survive. We perceive these things to be normal and part of life. From the perspective of the animals however, if they were aware of it, we would be their 'reptilians' since we operate just like them. But we never see ourselves that way, we don't think we're the bad guys because all we do is try to survive. The entities don't see themselves as the bad guys either since they're also trying to survive. What we do to the animals is almost exactly what these beings do to us and they need to keep us imprisoned here to feed off of us just like farmers keep their cattle locked up in farms and stables to get what they need from them.

**Evidence #1: The perspective of past life regression hypnosis** 

Calogero Grifasi is a past life regression hypnotist from Italy. He has posted thousands of past life regression sessions on youtube that explain what happens to the soul inbetween lives, how the Reptilians feed off of us energetically while we're physically on Earth and how they try to manipulate us into accepting reincarnation when we die by disguising themselves as religious figures in the astral.

I've analyzed more than 400 sessions of his with different clients from all over the world but the following sessions are one of the most significant sessions he's posted in English that you need to see for yourself:


Session 1: [**Entity masquerades as Jesus to entrap souls upon death**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mh5cGA7RgM&) - This is an investigative session on the reincarnation cycle to find out what happens to a soul inbetween lives and it shows how a soul is being deceived by astral entities to reincarnate back on Earth.

Session 2: [**This session shows how Reptilian entities interfere with us during and after our lives on Earth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXAnbS494zM&).



Session 3: [**This session reveals stuff about alien technology and how the entities use religions in their favor and against us**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HFOecADZeM&).


Session 4: [**Another session which reveals that Earth acts as a soul reincarnation trap for anyone who decides to incarnate here which confirms the information coming from the other sources with other clients**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czqCLvn8TSw).


The information that's coming out of Calogero's sessions doesn't actually come from himself directly, as he is the person who investigates and asks the questions, the information is coming from people that are able to enter the hypnotic state of mind which are either his clients or people who enter the hypnotic state for his clients. He has posted thousands of sessions with different people from all over the world that talk about encountering the same type of entities who play 'God', 'Jesus',""angels"" that trick people into reincarnating back on Earth and having their memories completely erased. Feel free to research as many of his hypnotic sessions as you'd like, [here's his sessions in italian and spanish that are subtitled in english](https://www.youtube.com/@calogerogrifasi/search?query=_EN_). He also has other channels in other languages or subtitled in french,german,spanish,polish,romanian,russian,portuguese,etc that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/calogerogrifasi/channels?view=49&shelf_id=62).

---

Here's an american woman who also practices past life regression hypnosis and while she has nothing to do with Calogero Grifasi, [she came to the same conclusions](https://redd.it/tbqk61) about the afterlife with her own clients.

Moreover, the work of other past life regressionists such as [William Criado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFG-j0XlDcI&ab_channel=WilliamCriado) and [Aurelio Mejia](https://www.youtube.com/c/AurelioMej%C3%ADa/videos) also reveals that the Reptilians use us as a food source and trick us into reincarnating back here when our physical bodies die (unfortunately their work is entirely in spanish but you can turn on subtitles on youtube if you don't speak or understand spanish).

There's 4-5 different past life regressionists (that I know of, there's probably more) who discovered the same thing about the afterlife after each of them worked with different clients from all over the world.

**Evidence #2: The perspective of Gnosticism & Buddhism**

The word 'Gnostic' comes from the term 'gnosi' in greek which means 'knowledge'. The Gnostics were a group of people who seeked to reveal the truth of the supreme essence of the divine, thus overthrowing false beliefs of God, society and life in general. They say that humans are divine souls trapped in the physical world and that the only way one could attain salvation from this place is not through worshiping the Demiurge(the false God of religion) but through gaining secret esoteric knowledge about who you really are, where you came from, and about how these parasitic entities operate, which will eventually set you free from this physical world in which your soul is trapped in. In the Gnostic texts, they talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use us as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies. The Gnostic texts describe at length the manipulation of humankind by what they call non-human 'Archons' or rulers. The soul trap is also mentioned in [The Secret Book of John](https://redd.it/wdhamk), which confirms the information coming from other sources. More information about the gnostic beliefs can be found [here](https://www.worldhistory.org/Gnosticism/).

Buddhism teaches that reincarnation is an endless cycle of suffering (the wheel of Samsara) that can only be broken by achieving enlightment. In other words, we are stuck in a reincarnation cycle where we are bound to continuously suffer one way or another, life after life, until we spiritually wake up and break free from the reincarnation cycle.

**Evidence #3: The perspective of Remote Viewing**

Remote viewing or 'extra sensory perception' was developed in the 1970's by the CIA and was used for espionage purposes. Remote viewing is the ability of a human being to perceive information and imagery of remote geographical targets, regardless of time and space. While this is a natural ability, it is very hard to do without training.  [Here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9CbLV3t-qo&ab_channel=TechnicalIntuition) that teaches you the basics. People who effectively use remote viewing aren't special, they are simply highly trained individuals and anyone can learn how to do it. 

[Farsight Institute](https://farsight.org/index.html) has some of the best remote viewers on the planet today. Amongst many different projects, they have investigated the afterlife and the Reptilians using remote viewing techniques:

In a project called [The Death Traps](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Death_Traps_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), 3 highly trained remote viewers from the Farsight Institute were tasked to remote view what happens to the soul of a person when the psysical body dies. All 3 of them perceived the exact same scenario without communicating with each other, that the soul is confused, disoriented and ends up entering a tunnel of light which violently shocks the soul. Immediately after that, the soul no longer has the memory of who it was and where it come from. I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In another Farsight project called [The Escape](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Escape_main_page.html), they have investigated how Earth has long been used as a prison planet. The remote viewers have been able to psychically perceive the grid that surrounds the Earth which is being used to ""zap"" souls who attempt to go through it. Again, I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In many other remote viewing projects made by Farsight Institute such as [Area 51](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Area_51_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Oumuamua](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Oumuamua_and_Bird_of_Prey_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Zeus](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Zeus_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [The War In Heaven](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/War_In_Heaven_Farsight_Project_main_page.html) among others, they have often psychically perceived these agressive, evil-looking Reptilian beings with psychopathic minds who always try to control, conquer and manipulate other beings. 

You can find free to watch and pay to watch projects made by Farsight [here](https://farsight.org/).

---

Brett Stewart, another skilled remote viewer along with his team (they have nothing to do with Farsight Institute) have also investigated the afterlife. Their afterlife project is called 'Moksha' which means ""freedom from the reincarnation cycle"" in hindu. Brett and his team have reached very similar conclusions about the afterlife which only makes the information coming from Farsight's remote viewers seem even more credible. 

Brett and the other three trained remote viewers have remote viewed their target, ""Moksha"" blindly. None of the remote viewers have communicated before or during the experiment and only shared their findings and common denominators when all the remote viewing data was already collected. [You can watch their project here](https://odysee.com/@SergeantSchultz:2/Samsara-and-Rebirth:b).

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of remote viewing:


[This CIA document is not showing anything in regards to the prison planet stuff, but I'm just sharing it to prove that the CIA have been using remote viewing since at least the 80's](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R000700070001-8.pdf).

[This declassified CIA document shows that in 1984 the government remote viewed the planet Mars 1 million years B.C and found strange looking entities there](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf).

**Evidence #4: The perspective of Robert Monroe**

Robert Monroe was the father of out-of-body experiences and astral projection. After having had out-of-body experiences for more than 30 years, Monroe discovered that our reality is used to create and harvest what he calls 'loosh' energy(emotional energy that every being produces). He claims that this universe has been enslaved for the production of loosh energy by inter-dimensional beings who see themselves as rulers and humanity as their enslaved cattle. His book [Far Journeys](https://www.amazon.com/Far-Journeys-Trilogy-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385231822) gives detailed information about loosh, [here's some references from his book](https://redd.it/te0fgs).
 Robert Monroe also claims that another source of loosh is humans’ worship of Gods.

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of astral projection and out-of-body experiences, [this being one of them](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf).

---

**Evidence #5: The perspective of psychedelic experiencers** 

[Many people who've done psychedelics reported a certain kind of experience indicating that this place is either a prison planet or a soul farm and that we are being farmed energetically](https://redd.it/zyzx0t), which confirms the information coming from other sources that have nothing to do with psychedelics, such as gnosticism, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data and also Robert Monroe's out of body experiences and research.

---

**Evidence #6: The perspective of David Icke**

For the last 30 years, David Icke has been a full-time investigator into who and what is actually controlling our society from the shadows. David Icke believes that the universe is made up of vibrational energy and consists of an infinite number of dimensions. His vast research suggests that an inter-dimensional race of Reptilian beings have hijacked the Earth and continuously manipulate global events in order to keep humans controlled and in constant fear.

[In this video David talks about how the Reptilians control our society, why the human eye is unable to see them and how they use us as an energetic food source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaF7NgnfCc). 

[David Icke talking about the Archons, Gnosticism & The Reptilian Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzCDwGUiHBU&).

David Icke has wrote more than 20 books about how our society actually works and who runs it. His books are extremely well researched. One of his books gives detailed information about the way the Reptilians operate and how they manipulate us: [Children of the Matrix: How an Interdimentional Race Has Controlled the Planet for Thousands of Years - And Still Does](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/dp/0957630891/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=david+icke&qid=1608115915&s=books&sr=1-5): ""*We are born into a world controlled by unseen forces that have plagued and manipulated humanity for thousands of years*"".

**Evidence #7: The perspective of Wes Penre**

[Wes Penre](https://wespenrevideos.com/about/) is a researcher of metaphysics, the alien presence on Earth, the matrix that we find ourselves in, our human origins, and much more.

[In this article](https://battleofearth.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/article-2-the-death-trap-and-how-to-avoid-it/), Wes explains how the tunnel of light death trap works and how to avoid it. The information is very complex but extremely well researched.

Wes has provided massive amounts of information on a wide range of topics: The illuminati, the shadow government, the moon matrix, the afterlife, entity possession, reptilian manipulation, the reincarnation soul trap and much, much more. [Here is his entire work in PDF's](https://wespenre.com/7-first-to-fifth-level-of-learning-in-pdf/).

**Evidence #8: The perspective of Simon Parkes**

[Simon Parkes](https://www.simonparkes.org/about) was an elected politician in the UK who served a full term of office. He claims to have had alien experiences his entire life, including experiences with the Reptilians. He also comes from a family with a background in the secret services (Mi5 and Mi6).

[In this segment from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6dxXAAAIp4)(listen from 1:11:47 to 1:19:57), Simon talks about the tunnel of light being a soul trap and that near death experiencers are being genuine in regards to what they've seen on the other side, but that they're not aware that it is all a trap designed to recycle their souls and wipe their memories clean.

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKf-S-PdA50&ab_channel=ChrisTurnerFilms), Simon talks about the fact that the system doesn't want to publicize the Reptilians because they signed an agreement with them to not be publicized and that the Reptilian race has been manipulating humanity for thousands of years.

---

**Evidence #9: The perspective of George Kavassilas**

Spiritual teacher and alien experiencer George Kavassilas, [talks about the false messiah that people unknowingly worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YgK-JCkmrc) ""*there are beings who come from a very dark place who have mastered to ability to pose as beings of love and light*"". 

[George talks about the Demiurge (or the false God of religions) who pretends to be our creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQPaXJ3355g&ab_channel=GnosticInfinity).

In this podcast, George [talks about the Matrix we find ourselves in, the ""God virus"" and how people naively worship, obey and pray to the very entities that enslave and harvest our souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKWPxKSUgQ).

---

**Evidence #10: The perspective of Val Valerian**

Val Valerian is a former CIA agent (real name John Grace) who started writing about the soul reincarnation trap and about Earth being a prison planet in the 1990's. In one of his books he writes:

“*It is they (grey aliens) who await in the light when a human being dies. The human being is then recycled into another body and the process begins all over again… Hence the Light and Tunnel at death Trap. Scanning someone they wish to recycle as they near death, the aliens discover who the person was close to has died. They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper. If you CHOOSE to follow you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice… these entities view Earth as a big farm.*” - Val Valerian

His books give detailed information about this place being a prison planet, aliens manipulating us, soul harvesting, soul traps and more: [Matrix II](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-II-Abduction-Manipulation-Technology/dp/B000LPJ46U) & [Matrix V](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Quest-Spirit-Ultimate-Frontier/dp/B000UQ9PAK).

**Evidence #11: The perspective of Alex Collier**

Alex Collier claims to be in contact with an ET race from the constellation of Andromeda. According to him, ""the Draconians(reptilians) are the force behind the repression of human populations everywhere in this galaxy"". He goes into detail about that [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEm8ovIuik&ab_channel=OysteinSvendsen). 

[In this clip, Alex Collier gives instructions on how to escape the tunnel of light soul reincarnation trap at death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GynOkYGChro&ab_channel=SoulTrapMatrix). He claims that if you ignore the tunnel of light and you say to yourself ""I wish to go home"" you will return to the dimension you came from before you came to Earth. While I personally don't think that this will work since you no longer have the memory of your old home nor the memory of the coordinates of your old home, I guess it's worth a try. But you must always have a plan b in case things don't go as planned.

Some of Alex's interviews and lectures over the years can be found [here](https://www.alexcollier.org/articles/).

Can we be 100% sure that Alex Collier has really been in contact with these beings from Andromeda? No! However, the information that he puts forward does confirm the information coming from the other sources regarding the Reptilians, the tunnel of light trap, and regarding what awaits us when we die, so I will still consider it evidence.

**Evidence #12: The perspective of Wayne Bush**

Massive research on the afterlife made by researcher Wayne Bush indicates that the white tunnel of light is luring souls into a mind-wipe reincarnation trap, how the Demiurge(false God entity) controls our society and more:

**Final words**

Waking up to the possibility that we could be living on a prison planet can be unsettling, disturbing, depressing but also enlightening, awakening and liberating. However if we are to do something about our situation, then it must be known.
 
The same information that I presented here is being confirmed by a variety of different sources which in my opinion is evidence that there's a lot of truth to this theory. I don't pretend to know the absolute truth nor am I saying that the information that I've presented you is the absolute truth. The only thing I can say is these are the conclusions I've reached about our reality and the afterlife after having researched them for many years. If anyone says that they are 100% sure, without a shadow of a doubt, about what happens when we die, then that person is a fraud in my opinion. Nobody will be able to get to the 100% absolute truth about this stuff, but what you can do is to research this topic from every angle/perspective possible so that you can put as many puzzle pieces together as you can which will allow you to have a greater understanding of who we really are, where we came from and what we're actually on this planet for, so **do not stop here. I highly encourage you to do your own research on this subject and to try to come up with your own conclusions about what awaits us when we die**. Most people only rely on what religion and the bible tells them about the afterlife and never do any individual research themselves whatsoever. Religion offers one perspective, not the full picture.

**You are an infinite, powerful creator being who will never cease to exist** but if your soul is put in a new body with no memory of your previous incarnations then that's as close to 'dying' on a soul level as you'll get because you'll be reborn as a completely new person who has to relearn everything from scratch, a new version of you who will never know the old version of you and what you were all about.

This is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face."" - Former CIA director and Cercle member William Colby giving advice to his friend senator John DeCamp, urging to quit his investigations into the Franklin child abuse affair and to write a book about his experiences (The Franklin Coverup, 2nd edition, foreword).

21,We are witnessing Operation Mockingbird in real time as it shapes the public opinion on the death of President Bush,5739.0,a266sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/a266sq/we_are_witnessing_operation_mockingbird_in_real/,486.0,1543694036.0,"The things you won't hear reported or even considered about the life of President Bush:

He was the grandson of the person responsible for assigning ammunition contracts in ww1.

His father was a Connecticut Senator who's company was dissolved by congress for trading with the nazis in ww2.

He likely was involved with the CIA and the assassination of President Kennedy (Google JFK II) at a time when the CIA had absorbed the Nazi spy apparatus (Google Operation Paperclip).

He was appointed Director of the CIA to squash the Church Commission and testified to congress that propaganda against the citizens of the US by the CIA would continue (Google Church, Commission and Operation Mockingbird).

Ran the Reagan Whitehouse and coordinated the CIA smuggling of cocaine into the US to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua.  Traded arm to Iran requiring presidential pardons for these crimes. (Google Tower Commission Report, Gary Webb, Dark Alliance).  Fire bombed portions of Panama cleaning up the drug channels.  

Bankrupted the Soviet Union creating the Oligarchy we see today in the Soviet Union  used the cia to begin the war in afganistan and created the taliban using bonds which were to come due in 2001. Hired the Bin Laden family to build military bases in Saudi arabia.   Pitted Iran against Iraq in the Iraq-Iran war.  Began the air campaign of the Iraq war on a weakened iraq.

  His son continued his father's wars with an illegal ground invasion of Iraq and Afganistan after 9/11.  Likely 9/11 was staged to destroy the records of the maturing bonds used to fund these crimes and the trillions of dollars of fraud being investigated in the pentagon.  His son was torturing, kidnapping, and killing people furthing this lawless campaign, settling scores, and cleaning up loose ends.  Guantanamo.

There is literally no visible family more politically  powerful  who have as effectively worked to promote war and undermine America's moral standing in the world than the Bush family.  4 generations of war profiterring, trading with America's enemys, drug trafficking, torture, assasinations, and operating outside of the rule of law.

But the mainstream media will maintain the media blackout of even a mention of these crimes against America and the rule of law.  It truly is impressive how they can control and shape the narrative.

Hijacking my own post to highlight a specific issue that's addressed in the podcast:

[Trusted News Initiative (TNI) discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ruu6mu/mass_censorship_the_trusted_news_initiative_tni/?)

The Trusted News Initiative (TNI) is a key part to understanding how and why any criticism of the vaccine is being censored. That topic alone needs its own thread. There's a lot to unpack in this main thread, so there isn't a whole lot of space for a discussion about TNI that needs to happen.

# Preface

Joe Rogan has his podcast exclusively on Spotify. It's 3 hours long. Some people don't have Spotify. Some people don't have 3 hours to listen to a guy talk very slowly. I took the time to type out the main points brought forth by Dr. Malone. The podcast is about 95% Dr. Malone talking, with the remainder as Joe. If you do not have Spotify, you can listen to it from [this link here](https://odysee.com/@altmedia96:2/dr-robert-malone-joe-rogan-experience-1093:e) which is unlikely to be taken down.

Formatting:

1. When Dr. Malone speaks, I use the "">"" quote function. 
2. When Joe speaks, I put ""Joe:"" in front of the statement.
3. When I paraphrase a verbose point, I have it as a bullet. Interviews are often a bit rambly, especially when they're three hours long. When people try to get a point out, it tends to get dragged out as they try to on-the-fly figure out a way to describe it the best. I did *my* best to boil it down to what they were actually trying to say, using their own vocabulary. I understand this may upset people, but that's why I link to the original podcast above.
4. When I skip through or alter a quote for sake of simplicity, it is in brackets ""[]"".
5. I sometimes add clarifying statements in parentheses.

Transcriptionst's Note:

This is simply a volunteer effort to let this information be more easily spread. At some point I'll spit this whole episode through an automated AI transcriber, but I don't exactly know how to do that. There is a lot of stuttering, stammering, and on-the-fly rewording that I've left out, so I do not consider my omission of those instances as being unfaithful to the dialogue. I've also left out a lot of side-talk like ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"", ya know the thing that Joe Rogan does a lot. I deliver information in chronological order as it is presented in the interview. At the time of this post, this will not be the final iteration and is subject to change and improvement. If you have an issue with the way I've transcribed something, please include what you would like me to edit and I will. If you have the studies that Dr. Malone references, please consider including it in a comment so that I can paste it where appropriate. I greatly recommend that you listen to the full podcast if possible. Feel free to cross-post this to your underground communities.

## Dr. Malone's testimony about himself:

- Robert was present in the main labs that were responding to the very first HIV outbreak

- Developed a series of technologies about how to manufacture mRNAs, structure it and eventually put it into cells (eventually leading to the development of these COVID vaccines) 

- Robert has been involved in every major outbreak since AIDS

- Has won billions of dollars in federal grants

- Brought in by NIH to serve as the ""study section chair""

- Countless hours working for the CDC, has many friends in the CDC

- A "" deep insider"" in terms of government 

- Has known Tony Fauci personally, has worked with him his entire career 

- Does not receive any money from the popularity of his tech

- De-platformed from LinkedIn for noting a conflict of interest regarding officials in Pfizer 

- was reinstated after LinkedIn admitted they didn't have the ""talent to fact check him""

- Was de-platformed again after a Microsoft fact checker concluded that Robert was an ""anti-vaxxer"" and was therefore deserving of a ban

- Banned from twitter but unsure what specific tweet kicked him off (Twitter never tells)

- Suspects that it was one of two tweets that had to do with informing Pfizer vaccine potential defects, as well as how large information-direction organizations are dealing with COVID media

## Main Interview:

>I've tried to make sure people have access to the information about those risks and potential benefits, the true unfiltered academic papers and raw data, etc...

>The policy being implemented is one in which no discussion of the risks are allowed, because by definition they will allow vaccine hesitance. Because of this, Informed Consent is not happening, and it is in fact being blocked.

>There's a CIA agent I've co-published with in the past named Michael Calahan. He was in Wuhan in the 4th quarter of 2019. He called me from Wuhan on January 4th. At this time I was managing a team that was focusing on drug discovery for organo-phosphate poisoning, ergo nerve agents, for DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency), involving high performing computing and bio-robot screening. He told me, ""Robert, you've gotta get your team spun up because we've got a problem with this new virus."" I've worked with him through prior outbreaks. So it was then when I turned my attention to this. I started modelling a key protein of this virus, a protease inhibitor, when the sequence was released on January 11th as the ""Wuhan Seafood Market Virus."" I've been going nonstop on this ever since (to that point, with drug repurposing). I'm the one that originally discovered famotidine as an agent because I was self-treating myself after I got infected with agents that we identified through our computer modelling.


>I was up up up on all the latest information from China and everywhere else. I knew all about this virus. I watched all the videos of people dropping in the street. My lungs were burning until I took famotidine, otherwise known as Pepcid.

- Today (Dec 31) the first patient is enrolled in clinical trials for the combination of famotidine and celecoxib for treating SARS/COVI-2. It is based on Malone's discoveries.

- We had data to show that Ivermectin improves the combination [famotidine and celecoxib], but the FDA created enormous roadblocks to us doing an Ivermectin arm that we had to drop it. The FDA created so much grief that the DOD decided the ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"".

- It's not just Ivermectin [that they're putting a stop to], it's also hydroxychloroquine.

> There is good modelling studies that probably half a million excess deaths have happened in the United States through the intentional blockade of early treatment by the US government. Half a million. That is a well-documented number. And that's about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

> If you ask me why this is happening, you're asking me to get into somebody's head. What I can say as a scientist is what I can observe: the behaviors, the actions, the correspondence.

- Zev Zelenko [...] clearly documents the conspiracy between Janet Woodcock and Rick Bright to make it so that physicians could not administer hydroxychloroquine outside of the hospital.

- Rick Bright was head of the BARDA (Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority) which is the group that, for instance, funded the J&J vaccine and Operation Warp Speed, etc... 
- BARDA is the ""big ticket funder"" of bio defense products
- Janet Woodcock was head of Operation Warp Speed for drugs, and until very recently head of the FDA. She is known as the person that kind of gets the credit for the Opioid Crisis for her role at the FDA.

>Rick Bright in videotaped testimony has explicitly spoken about how they conspired to cook up a strategy using Emergency Use Authorization to make it so that hydroxychloroquine could only be administered in the hospital which is far too late for when hydroxychloroquine should be used.

Joe: Why do they do that?

> That is what is the unknown. And there are so many whys and hows behind this. There's a stack of stuff that doesn't make sense that's about this high [hand gesture]. I can't get into Rick's head, though I know Rick quite well. He's currently working for the Rockefeller. He did a whistleblower case and then he left the government. All I know is that they did this, and that Rick admits on videotape that he did it. He claims that the reason was is that he believed there was no evidence of hydroxychloroquine being useful for this virus. Now that's false. Hydroxychloroquine was known to be effective against SARS-1.

> Hydroxy is one of the few molecules that have antiviral activity that is safe in pregnancy.

> The other part of Rick's story that kinda doesn't make sense, that there was no data of efficacy, is that I was the guy that first acquired, because I had Chinese connections, the Chinese protocol for treating this virus. I got it in late February, and I sent it in to my buddies at the CIA and it made it to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. So, the government had those documents when Rick Bright made those determinations. The assertion that there was no data on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is just false. It's there. What is the motivation? You're right. None of this makes sense.

> Both ivermectin and hydroxy are on the WHO list of essential medicines. They have been administered for millions and millions of doses. They are among the safest medicines we know when administered within the acceptable pharmaceutical window. Ivermectin is even safer than hydroxy. So Merck coming out of the blue and saying ivermectin isn't safe is really inexplicable.

> I sit on the Active Committee for drugs as an observer. The Active Committee is the NIH committee that's guiding the clinical trials for these various repurposed and novel drugs. I saw, listened to, heard, and witnessed the representative of Merck that's on the committee, because the committee is full of pharmaceutical representatives even though it's an NIH public committee, explicitly attack the decision for the federal government to test ivermectin. She said there's no reason to do this. Since then, Active Sticks(?) is still testing ivermectin and they've had to go to a higher dose because as we pointed out, essentially the trials were designed to fail.

> There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of multiple players in the pharmaceutical industry in concordance with the federal government to kill ivermectin as a potential alternative early treatment strategy.

Joe: And if you were going to follow the money, the problem is there's no a lot in ivermectin because it is a generic drug and any compound pharmacy can make it. And it's fairly cheap.

> It's fairly cheap because it's easy to make. You can buy ivermectin in bulk for less than a penny a dose.

- The Chinese government has been using hydroxychloroquine, with effective results. Though, they have not been using ivermectin. 

- The virus was ripping through Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh has 2/3 the population as the entire United States but is only 2% of its square mileage. The decision was made out of desperation to deploy early treatments as packages widely throughout the province. The package contained a number of agents, the composition of which has not been formally disclosed. It was done in coordination with the WOH, and whatever was in those package was rumored to include ivermectin, but there was a specific visit of Biden to Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). There was an explicit decision in the Indian government not to disclose the contents of those packages. Uttar Pradesh has flatlined in terms of deaths, while the US is still somehow struggling with Covid.

Joe: Isn't there some evidence that the vaccine actually helps people with Long Covid?

> That was the rumor at the time. No there is no evidence. Anecdotally there was, but since then what we do know, for sure and well documented, if you've got prior Covid and natural immunity, you have a higher risk of adverse events from the jab.

- People who have natural immunity have a much higher risk factor for the whole spectrum of adverse effects, between 2 or 4-fold, if they get the jab.

Joe: But even though that's known, there are so many people out there telling people who have just recovered from Covid to get vaccinated.

> It's nucking futs. It's just wrong.

- According to the study in Israel with 2.5 million people, [natural immunity] is about 27-fold better at protecting against developing the disease (note: infection does not equal disease).

- That is only 1 in over 140 studies that document that natural immunity is superior to the vaccine induced immunity

> and by the way, as a vaccinologist and an immunologist, I wouldn't expect anything different.

- The CDC disputes this despite the evidence using a very small study with intrinsic bias, much smaller than the Israeli study, much less rigorous statistical power. The CDC study did this themselves. 

Joe: So they funded this study, they did it themselves, and do you believe they did it with the intent of coming to the conclusion-

> You're asking me to apply intent, and I've had too much time with lawyers and I'm not going to do it [chuckles]

> What we're experiencing is a coordinated media warfare the level of which we have never seen before. And I and my peers who are experienced in multiple outbreaks have never seen this level of coordinated propaganda.

- The TNI (Trusted News Initiative), which began fall of 2020, ties together big tech and big media in service of the government and was built expressly for the purpose of ""protecting our democracy and voting integrity from undue influence from hostile offshore players through media information campaigns."" The TNI is the response of the Western nations to the alleged Russian interference. It surveys all information about elections to (allegedly) prevent intrusion of foreign information into the democratic process. Shortly after the TNI's creation, there was an awareness in the pharmaceutical industry that this organization could be used to address a particular challenge that they had: anti-vaxxers ""(the label that is used to take anybody out that raises concerns about vaccine safety. Anti-vaxxer is the pejorative that is applied making it really easy to basically take off the table anybody that is saying something contrary to the interests of the vaccine industry)."" The TNI has also been deployed against climate skeptics.

> So there was a decision that this same toolkit [TNI], this same integrated, international media and high tech organization, led by the BBC, would be pivoted to resisting ""vaccine misinformation and disinformation"". They let out a proud press announcement last fall that this is what they were going to do. They defined these things ""misinformation and disinformation"" as anything which was going to lead to vaccine hesitancy and which was contrary to the official statements of the WHO, or the respective national health organizations. [...] Whatever the CDC or Tony Fauci says is truth, by definition. Any information or discussion which is contrary to that truth will be suppressed, it will be deleted, and those people that are expressing these opinions that would lead to ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which to some eyes would be informed consent, that information will not be allowed. And those people that are spreading that information will not be allowed to interact in the public sphere in social media. If you want to unpack this whole thing, it starts with understanding the Trusted News Initiative.

- The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, esteemed and full professors, were systematically deplatformed by the federal government for criticizing the effectiveness of vaccine lockdowns, and labled as ""fringe"" epidemiologists.

- Sweden used a hands off approach and handled Covid much more effectively than the US

- Israel has a financial deal with Pfizer and only use Pfizer vaccines. Israel is on their 4th dose. Israel, compared to its surrounding states who don't have that level of vaccine uptake at all, has a significantly higher mortality rate.

> Rate of infection is a hard variable because it is a function of the density of testing. The more you look for it, the more you find. The incidents of infection is completely contaminated by the frequency of testing and the density of testing. The only thing close to a decent outcome indicator that isn't subject to all this bias in the system, except in a few states: Iceland and Scandinavian states generally have relatively clean data, the UK to some extent has cleaner data, it is now clear that the Israeli dataset is contaminated by all kinds of monkey business in terms of what gets deleted... But, the only thing that seems close to a reasonable outcome variable is all-cause mortality.

- There are many variables that make it difficult to clearly define a vaccine-caused death, let alone a vaccine-correlated death. 

[Malone lists many examples of how difficult it is to define, such as co-morbidities and physical trauma.]

> All of these things you can't sort out what's what, you just have to take the aggregate value and hope that you have a large enough sample size that it corrects for all the [uncontrollable variable] noise that's inherent in the system.

Joe: Now you just glossed over the financial incentive to report a Covid death. What is that? What is the financial incentive? Because there are all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money, and that they're incentivized to make something- mark it down-

> They're not rumors. I don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head. I'm not a hospitalist or a hospital administrator. But, the numbers are quite large. They're something like a $3,000 death benefit to a hospital if it can be claimed to be Covid. There's a financial incentive to call somebody Covid positive. The CDC made the determination in year one. This is why all our baseline data is junk.

> The hospitals receive a bonus from the government, I think it's like 3,000 bucks, if someone is hospitalized and able to be declared Covid positive. They also receive a bonus, I think the total is something like $30,000 of incentive, if somebody gets put on the vent. Then they get a bonus is someone is declared death with Covid.

> The CDC made the determination that they were going to make a core assumption: if PCR positive and you die, that is ""Death due to Covid"". An extreme example just to show the absurdity: If a patient comes in with a bullet hole to the head, and they do a nose swap and come up PCR positive, they are determined to have died from Covid.

Joe: (in disbelief) But is that real?

> Yes

> For sure trauma and other things.

Joe: I've seen that said, but I've always thought that's ridiculous.

> It's not a question of what the hospital would do, it's a question of med codes.

Joe: So it really is true, that if someone has a gunshot wound, and they're dying of that gunshot wound, and if you check them for Covid, and if they're Covid positive, and they die, then they're marked off as a Covid death.

> That is by definition from the CDC. It was a decision that was made early on.

> The data has been so thoroughly manipulated that it's hard for any of us to make sense of it.

[Explanation of how laws and treaties work for clinical trials.]

> Over the last few years, the FDA made policy that the responsibility vests with the sponsor. That's fancy regulatory talk that Pfizer owns it. So you ask the question: Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the data isn't contaminated and manipulated? The answer is Pfizer.

> What gets reported in a study is often biased by how the study is structured. Because when you write the study protocol, you list the expected adverse effects. So if those things happen, often times those things get checked. But I guarantee one expected adverse events was not seizure and paralysis.

> There's all kinds of financial incentives to make bad stuff go away and highlight good stuff. It makes the sponsor happy. And then you get another contract. These are not little contracts. A modest contract is 20 million dollars. A big one is 100 million or more. These are big money deals. You want to keep that money flowing, and you want to keep your sponsor happy. So that's what has come out with the whistleblower from Pfizer is that the contractor, I think it's here in Texas, that ran a bunch of those clinical trials and appears to have manipulated data in a variety of ways. And this is done at the level of checking the data and reconciling the data and deciding which things go into the database and which things don't go into the database. And whether or not if someone had an adverse event after shot 1 and then they're dropped because they won't take shot 2. Do we drop them out of the overall study analysis? We have all this specific language that we use in our business: the ""intent to treat cohort,"" the ""per protocol cohort,"" these are separate analyses because its known that you can manipulate the data in these different ways.

- Thomson Reuters Organization has become the ""fact-checker"" of choice and is tied closely to Pfizer with common corporate ownership. They are the fact-checker of Twitter. Integrated on a board level. Thomson Reuters is making the decisions, which has connections to Pfizer, about what information is allowed to be discussed on Twitter. 

> (Speculation) If I was to follow the money [...] Hospitals are incentivized to treat Covid patients. If Covid patients are treated outside of the hospital and are therefore prevented from going to the hospital, such is the case in the imperial valley where Bryan Tyson and George Fareed have saved thousands and thousands of lives of indigenous Latinos [...], and if people are giving treatments that are keeping people out of the hospitals, then they're not getting that revenue.

- The people who are doing the attacking are almost universally hospital administrators and hospital-based physicians.

- There is a recent paper out of Hong Kong: Comprehensive Analysis Myocarditis in Boys Hospitalized. 

> The myocarditis was so bad after vaccination, and these are all verified post-vaccination. It was so bad that you went to the hospital. Incident rate is 1 in 2700. There's all kinds of handwaving that ""oh myocarditis is mild and the recover from it"". Those statements aren't, let's say, gently based in fact. Historic incidents of death post-myocarditis is about 27%. The assertion is ""well this is a different kind of myocarditis and therefore it's not going to kill these kids or young adults."" These things are being said in the absence of data. It's pure speculation.

Joe: I keep hearing that it's ""mild myocarditis"" and that it ""eventually goes away,"" but not citing any studies, and I don't think there are any long term studies.

> There can't be! [chuckles] By definition!

> I think I might be the only one that's deeply involved in the development of this tech that doesn't have a financial stake in it. So for me, the reason is, because what's happening is not right. It's destroying my profession. It's destroying the practice of medicine worldwide. It's destroying public health in medicine. I'm a vaccinologist. I've spent 30 years developing vaccine - a stupid amount of education learning how to do it and what the rules are. And for me, I'm personally offended by watching my discipline get destroyed for no good reason at all, except for apparently financial incentives and, I don't know, political ass-covering?

> There is a huge number of dysmenorrhea and menometrorrhagia, alterations in [menstrual cycles] in women.

> Then there are the women who are postmenopausal that have started bleeding.

> Why is this happening, what are the things that connect these things? What is it that drives menstruation. The answer is the ovary. The ovary is the controller through hormones and ovulation. What did we learn early on from the Pfizer data package? Which by the way, when that was disclosed by [name?] from Japan and sent to me, was the first thing that really lit me up and let me know that something here was rotten. When I got that, I picked out, as [name?] had done, I was given the task of independently evaluating it, and then I took that package and I gave it to a more senior regulatory professional that I respected and I said ""these are the things I see. This looks really bad."" He said ""Oh you missed this that and the other thing."" These missing things include reproductive toxicology, evaluations of teratogenicity (birth defects), standard stuff that's always done. Genotoxicity, not done. What was done was a cobbled together group of data that didn't even involve the vaccine. It used other mRNAs in non-GLP, that's fancy speak for ""not done with rigor"" or ""not according to the rules"" - all cobbled together and sent in to the regulatory agencies of the world to justify going and head and giving jabs to everybody under emergency use authorization. That's the truth of it. That's the short version using common language.

- An early test they did do was on rats showed that the mRNA goes to the ovary at a very high rate. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to stay in the arm at the injection site. It instead goes all over the body, and specifically to two places that are kind of anomalous: bone marrow and the ovaries. We can isolate it to the ovarian signal because it doesn't occur in testes. So we have a non-clinical trial (rat trial) that shows affects on the ovaries. And when it is deployed widely in humans, we continue to see the alteration in menstrual cycle.

- Rabbis of the Hasidic Jews had to closely monitor the effects on their women's menstrual cycles because of their religious concern with cleanliness (see the Pentateuch on menstrual cleanliness). There are strict rules on cleanliness during intercourse. These Rabbis, being very familiar with their women's menstrual cycles, immediately recognized disruptions in the menstrual cycles of their communities. They came out with a clear statement that children should not be vaccinated, authenticated by law. And with adults it was strongly discouraged.

> Your girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. And these lipids appear to be affecting menstruation in some way. But menstruation is just one of these adverse effects.

- The disease itself (Covid), the mRNA genetic vaccines, and the DNA virus administered genetic vaccines (J&J) all have these symptoms: clotting, brain fog, etc...

> We don't see these problems by the way - adenovirus vector vaccine have been in development for my entire life, 30 years. There are licensed adenovirus vector vaccines. So it's not something that's intrinsic to the platform. Well what is it? The common variable is spike. Just to cut to the chase.

Joe: Spike proteins?

> Yes.

[A lot of technical jargon in this segment somewhere around 1:30:00 that I'm honestly too tired to transcribe. He describes the effects lipids and proteins and spike etc...]

> It is the job of the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their genetically engineered spike is safe. They never did that. And so all of this pressure that comes back from folks like me [...] I get criticized because ""oh well prove that it's not safe."" I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. It's pharma's job to prove that it is safe. It's not my job to prove that it's not safe.

> Does it cause toxicity in people? I think the answer is pretty clear now: it does. The question we're asking now is: how often and how bad?

- There is a paper out that tried to explain the difference between Long Covid and post-vaccination syndrome. It concluded that the two are indistinguishable.

> There's this increasing awareness that there is some window of time after vaccination, not sure how long, when you're actually more susceptible to infection. So not only is the vaccine efficacy weaning, but the multiple jab strategy is actually creating more and more windows where people have this period of T-cell suppression.

Joe: This T-cell suppression, are there any studies on the amount of time that it takes before your system rebalances itself post-jab? 

> This is the obscenity for me of this whole, ""we're going to give four shots because we don't really know what to do and we need to do something."" I like to talk about the metaphor as a father: If you get a three year old a hammer, everything becomes a nail. That's kind of a simple way of saying people that aren't well trained given a powerful technology or tool will abuse it and overuse it. In this case there are multiple reasons not to do the multiple jabs. The simplest one for everybody to understand is, when your son develops seasonal allergies to pollen or whatever and its so bad that he can't go to school you say ""oh well lets take him to an allergist"". What do they do? They give him shots. What are those shots? They're high doses of antigen that are administered repeatedly to your child. It induces something that as immunologists we call high zone tolerance. High zone tolerance basically amounts to an ability by giving multiple injections at high levels of antigen t o shut down T-cells in an antigen specific fashion.

- Malone clarifies that the T-cell suppression is only against that antigen, and likely does not affect anything else about the immune system but does not claim that there is absolutely 0 broader effect.

> The other things is that these are multiple jabs that are mismatched for the current circulating virus. That's akin to repeatedly taking a flu vaccine from two seasons ago and hoping that it's going to protect against this flu.

- Malone was infected twice 4 months after taking 2 jabs of moderna, infected with both the original Wuhan strain and Delta

> The window of efficacy seems to keep shrinking (effectiveness of the vaccine)

> There is signs in some data, from Denmark, of negative efficacy against Omicron as a function of the number of vaccinations up to 3. Positive efficacy meaning it protects you. Negative efficacy meaning your probability is higher if you've taken the vaccine. It's compared to unvaccinated. It seems to be somewhat higher if you've had 1 jab, even worse if you've had 2, even more likely to get infected if you've had 3 injections.

- Malone describes an anecdote to show how someone who is vaccinated is more likely to participate in dangerous behavior, behaviors with increased likelihood of infection like clubbing and going out, because they feel protected by the vaccine. He says this to say that it may not be the vaccine itself causing the increase in infection, but the resulting behaviors, which are variables unaccounted for. The FDA did not force any pharmaceutical company to collect this data even though they should have.

- Malone goes on to say there are studies out and coming out now about the correlation between jabs and increase in infectivity. The data came from the Netherlands, likely their government. The statisticians are debating how to interpret the data because of how contaminated the original data is, regarding the numerator (total infections).

Joe: So would the assumption be that there's something that's happening to people that are vaccinated where it makes them more susceptible to this particular strain of Covid is a vaccine escape variant?

> So now what you're doing is trying to impose a hypothesis. Which is good! And one of many possible hypotheses. So in a world, a proper world where we are allowed to debate these things, and do these kinds of studies, and examine these kinds of variables without being [draws finger across his neck] in social media, we'd have a very active discussion about this hypothesis and many others. That's my way of not answering your question.

> What we're doing with administering mismatched vaccine, we're driving the effector in memory cells, B and T, towards a population that is focused on a virus that no longer exists. In immune response you don't get everything.

> You didn't ask the question but I'm gonna answer it anyhow: What are your hypotheses for the poor durability of the vaccines?
> My answer is: it looks to me like original antigenic sin. Well that's kind of a cool terminology. What that means, let's unpack original antigenic sin, and what I think could be happening with these data, following your hypotheses you just shared, consistent with that, is that we're driving the immune response towards an antigen, the receptor binding domain of spike, that no longer exists with Omicron. It was initially denied, but it has become clear that all of us have a background immune response against beta coronaviruses. These are naturally circulating cold coronaviruses that have significant immunologic cross-reactivity with SARS COVI-2. And the problem with that, and original antigenic sin, is that those existing memory cells will dominate the immune response when you get infected and when you get vaccinated.

> Now let me unpack that in a way that makes sense for the common person. [...] The sum of your life experiences biases how you respond to - take you for example, in your martial arts, you must know this. What you've experienced in the past in prior fights is gonna bias how you respond to a new opponent. Same happens with your immune system. [...] The prior exposure of your immune system to an antigen that is closely related to a new antigen [biases your immune system as if it were the responding to the old one].

> It could very well be, that the further you're taking jabs, the further you're skewing your immune response in a way that's dysfunctional for infection to Omicron compared to someone who is immunologically naïve.

- Prior strains of Covid infected the deep lung. As the new strains are developing, it appears they are settling more in the throat instead. While it has a higher rate of infectivity, it is less pathogenic.

- The CDC modelling data suggested that by now all covid cases would be around 70-80% Omircon, which is now understood to be erroneous modelling.

- WHO asserts that there are no deaths associated with Omicron in the world at this moment. The mortality of Omicron is remarkably low. The official symptoms list for Omicron is pretty much identical to the common cold. It is a mild variant and is able to escape prior vaccination, typically because of a mismatched vaccine.

- The reproductive coefficient of the original Wuhan strain was about 2 to 3. Meaning on average, one would infect 2 to 3 other people if they have the virus themselves. Delta had a coefficient of 5 to 6. Omircon is about 7-10. That's measles territory.

> What that means is, we're all going to get infected, regardless of mask usage or social distancing.

> Our government is out of control on this. They are lawless. They completely disregard bioethics. They completely disregard the federal common rule. They've broken all the rules that I know of that I've been trained on for years and years and years. These mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are completely inconsistent with the Nuremberg Code. They are completely inconsistent with the Belmont Report. They are flat out illegal and they don't care. And the only thing standing in between us, and it's too late for many of our colleagues, including my unfortunate colleagues in the DOD (federal employee mandates). Hopefully we're going to be able to stop them before they take our kids.

- Most of the press statements on Omicron infectivity is based on modeled data, not real data, but it is shown as if it were real.

- The hospitalizations due to Covid appear to be dominantly Delta, not Omicron.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/observer.com/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-spy-intelligence-wo

If you've seen the netflix documentary about epstein you know that the documentary mostly focuses on the experiences of the individual victims. I'm NOT saying that the victims are lying, I 100 percent believe that Epstein Abused these poor girls.

However the legal case set forward by the girls isnt against any government institution (as it wouldn't be if they wanted any chance of winning the case), and the documentary largely ignored the larger facts surrounding epstein, it makes vague allusions to the fact that high profile people visited the island, all of the girls said that hundreds of girls came to the island but the case itself is made up of only 6 witnesses. 

I'm not even saying that its intentional, but the netflix documentary makes out that jeffrey Epstein was a predator who was only in it for himself. Which if I was the CIA or any other intelligence I would want that also, considering netflix ties to George Soros, I'm not surprised.

“Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?”

I’ve been interested in the “Avril Lavigne is dead"" conspiracy for a while, [so when someone posted this the other night](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dm24ri/what_happened_to_avril_lavigne_compelling/) I cleared my schedule and watched the whole thing. The documentary is very interesting. It’s basically just clips of Avril performing and giving interviews from her early days and then her later days.  The contrast between early Avril and later Avril is jarring when you watch the documentary in one sitting. There is absolutely no denying there is a [distinct change right around 2003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8fiLhS66HM). There’s a scene at the end of the movie where a blonde haired “Avril” is excited and passionate about doing her mother's makeup, and yet at the start of the movie there’s a clip of brown haired Avril saying how she doesn't like to be glamorous and doesn't like people around her doing her makeup. The change in personality is plain as day. I thought to myself ""there is just ***no way*** those are the same people"".

[The “Avril is dead” people point out very interesting clues](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7w3tkf/this_is_all_of_the_evidence_that_i_have_compiled/) that were apparent in the documentary. The old Avril is shorter, has brunette hair, darker eyes, a deeper voice, more of a tomboy, into punk, not a great vocalist, and loves writing music. They say the new Avril is taller, has blonde hair, lighter blue eyes, more feminine, prettier, a better singer, a higher voice, seemingly more pop than punk, and not the same songwriter. They argue she has different ears, moles, teeth, and even handwriting too. They even point to a picture of “Avril” from 2006 where [she has “Melissa” written on her hand](http://i.imgur.com/bqV5tv3.jpg) (Melissa Vandella is the purported name of the Avril “imposter”). ***There is no denying there appear to be kernels of truth to these statements.***

They theorize that Avril killed herself in 2003 because her Grandpa, whom she was close with, died, and the devastation of his death along with the pitfalls of fame drove her to suicide, and that a body double, possibly a clone, named Melissa pretended to be Avril going forward,

Now before this documentary I was very much on team ""Avril is dead"", but there was also no denying the “Avril is NOT dead” team had some “gotcha” points on their side.

The ""Avril isn’t dead crowd"" argues she looks extremely similar to the old Avril. Similar enough to explain any changes in appearance to aging/makeup/hair dye and not a body double. They say she is seen in the same hometown, she’s a good musician, she has the same parents, and while she may be slightly different than the old Avril, people grow up and change and that’s why she seems different. They also point out that Avril dated Sum 41 lead singer Deryck Whibley as far back in 2001, but married him in 2006, so how could it be possible that the Sum 41 lead singer knew Avril back in 2001 and married her in 2006 if she supposedly died in 2003? That crushes the theory, right?

The scene where the “new Avril” is doing makeup, the one I mentioned above, is so interesting because the change is so drastic from the “old Avril”, and yet those were presumably the same parents of the original Avril, so how could the imposter be involved with her parents, doing her mom’s makeup, and hugging her dad? Surely, her parents wouldn’t let a clone or an imposter into their lives like that?

Something never sat right about this conspiracy for me, but last night everything fell into place…

There’s a scene in the documentary that didn’t quite fit… it’s this video of “Avril” [singing at a local bookstore when she’s 16.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxC934J3lWM) When it played in the documentary my radar immediately went off… *“Wait a minute… that’s Avril?” She’s...* ***blonde****? She’s… cute... She’s... feminine, higher pitched, taller, and better at singing? … Why are her eyes blue? How could she change so much in  less than two years from this girl... to the “Sk8er boy” punk-chick, and then… change back?…* ***She seems just like the “fake Avril”...""***

Then it hit me like a ton of bricks…..

[THE GIRL IN THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxC934J3lWM) ***IS MELISSA.***

***MELISSA IS AVRIL LAVIGNE***’***S TWIN SISTER*** *who’s blonde, slightly taller, prettier, higher pitched, better at singing, more feminine, and replaced Avril in 2003.*

That’s why the new “Avril” seems so similar, and yet so different from the old Avril. That's why ""fake Avril"" is blonde and ""real Avril"" is brunette. That's why ""Avril"" is still seen in the same hometown, with the same parents, and looks so similar, and has musical talent… she is Melissa, the nearly identical twin sister to Avril who took over after Avril went away in 2003. That’s how Deryck knew “Avril” in 2001 and married her in 2006, even though she “died” in 2003. He wasn’t dating Avril, he was dating her sister, Melissa. Avril didn’t marry Chad Kroeger. Melissa did. Avril didn’t date Brody Jenner. Melissa did. Avril didn't record [Hello Kitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiaYDPRedWQ). Melissa did.

I have no idea what happened to Avril in 2003, but the suicide theorists could be right for the wrong reasons…. What if the record company wanted to replace Avril with her prettier, blonde, taller, barbie-like, better at singing twin sister? In the documentary it’s clear Avril didn’t listen to the record company and wanted to be her own person, whereas her sister is exactly what the record company was looking for… What if Avril was depressed about that, and then her grandpa died? And she hated the fame? And she hated living a lie?  What if there was a love triangle between Deryck, Melissa, and Avril? Could that storm have caused a suicide? Or did she just walk away like Paul McCartney to let her sibling take over because the CIA/Illuminati/whomever ordered it?

*History doesn’t repeat… but it does rhyme...*

I remember being so fascinated by the “Paul McCartney is dead” conspiracy. I vividly remember watching [a documentary about it](https://archive.org/details/TheWingedBeatle2012ExtendedVersion) for the first time. It was so interesting, however, like the Avril is dead conspiracy, the answer that Paul died in a car accident and they replaced him with a random look-a-like never felt quite right…

and then I read [this post by Miles W. Mathis…](http://mileswmathis.com/paul8.pdf)

and then I saw [this video…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UTDvwqHb7o)

***Paul McCartney had a twin brother who replaced him in 1966. He didn’t die, his brother just took over.***

The same thing happened to Avril Lavigne, although she may be actually dead… who knows, but the point is that ***there is historical precedence for replacing a superstar musician with their twin and the fans, sensing something wasn’t right, speculated that the original was replaced, but never quite put it all together.*** [Here is potentially another example](http://mileswmathis.com/elvis.pdf) (skip to the bottom for the twin speculation)

To those who think this is too crazy to believe, and that her having a secret twin sister is just too much of a stretch, consider for a second how unbelievable Avril’s rise to fame was. She won a radio contest and got to perform at a Shania Twain concert in front of 20,000 people when she was 15... and when she was still 16 she signs a record deal for 1.25 million? Then by 18 she’s an international superstar? Please. That “rise to fame” has “intelligence” agencies written all over it. Now with the resources and know-how of the intelligence community, not to mention the long, long, long history of the CIA being directly involved in the entertainment industry, it’s significantly less far-fetched to consider that Avril and Melissa were chosen because of their musical talents and because they’re identical twins...*.just like Paul and his brother.*

Also, if this theory is true, then you would expect to see some kind of intelligence/military connections in her family... well... from Wikipedia: ""Lavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in [Saint-Jérôme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me), Quebec.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Lavigne#cite_note-15) A member of the [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force), he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of [Morhange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morhange), in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne was born in 1954 at [RCAF Station Grostenquin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCAF_Station_Grostenquin) near [Grostenquin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grostenquin), [Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine), France.""

Lastly, if Avril and Melissa are twin sisters, then who is Michelle Lavigne, Avril's supposed younger sister? My best guess is like Mike McCartney, the one the public thinks is the true sibling is actually an imposter. Michelle[ doesn't resemble Avril or her mother very much.](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&id=3271A2A034F834167B02A25D23FCA6D41C423B19&thid=OIP.EQx1Wz5wGYpIT9A9XNaUYwAAAA&mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fc2.staticflickr.com%2F4%2F3013%2F2736210087_0a8dc54395.jpg&exph=500&expw=403&q=michelle+lavigne&selectedindex=12&ajaxhist=0&vt=0&eim=1,2,6) That would mean Melissa Vandella = Michelle Lavigne = Present day Avril Lavigne.

To summarize, my theory is that Avril Lavigne has a nearly identical twin sister who replaced her in 2003 and is now pretending to be Avril. There is not one part of the Avril is dead conspiracy that doesn’t fit… and yet it also satisfies the “Avril is alive” crowd too. There is no denying the differences between early Avril and late Avril, but there’s also no denying that the new Avril had relationships that seem to contradict the theory. But the twin theory satisfies everything.

Please let me know in the comments if this rings true to you or if you have anything to add!

Thank you!!!!

P.S… Avril's songs take on a whole new meaning if she had a twin sister… why did they have to make it so... complicated?


EDIT:

WOW!!!! Thank you all for taking the taking the time to read my theory! I have a couple of thoughts I want to add before this dies down. 

To the people who claim to be family members or know the family, and to the people who don't buy the twin theory: what is your explanation for the bookstore video of the 16 year old blonde girl that's supposed to be Avril?

To me, that video is the smoking gun that proves she's a twin. 

The girl in that video without a shadow of a doubt has natural blonde hair. The original Avril Lavigne has without a shadow of a doubt natural brunette hair. The girl in the video, and the original are absolutely, positively, 100% different people. They look mostly Identical, but the difference in natural hair color is unmistakable. 

Next, you could argue that the video was mislabeled and that it's not actually Avril, and it's simply a misunderstanding, but that's not logical because it's been around for at least a decade and it's never been disputed as actually being Avril. I'm assuming that bookstore is actually in her hometown and the media company verified it was Avril. 

Also, it can't be Avril's supposed younger sister either, because that's not even close to what she looks like. 

It also can't be an unrelated body double either, because she was 16 at the time and more or less irrelevant playing at a bookstore in front of 10 people. She would not have had an unrelated double at this point in her career nor needed one. Besides, a body double would look similar at best, not more or less identical. 

To summarize my logic... it's not the original brunette Avril, it's not a disputed video, it's not her younger sister, and it's not an unrelated body double, so who is it then if you don't believe it's the twin sister Melissa/Michelle Lavigne? 

To further the point, for over a decade now there's been speculation that Avril was replaced by a blonde haired look-a-like, and here we have video of a blonde haired Avril performing as if she were Avril when 
she was 16!",conspiracy,CIA

61,"Epstein was a CIA asset. The main players behind the worldwide child trafficking scandal are none other than the secret services - CIA, MI6, Mossad. Here is a collection of evidence.",2589.0,cp0amg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cp0amg/epstein_was_a_cia_asset_the_main_players_behind/,207.0,1565547831.0,"Following the Epstein ""suicide"", it's more clear than ever that there is an organization which uses children in pedophilic sex parties, in order to blackmail and control powerful people. These children are frequently murdered by these sick individuals. Some can also be traumatized for the purpose of creating dissociative personalities so they can be mind-controlled. For a full breakdown of the worldwide scandals, see [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/689fwv/evidence_of_child_abuse_in_majorly_influential/) and [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9274Q8jv_wM) - both of which are non-exhaustive and already out of date, such is the scale of this operation.

Common traits of these scandals are:

* Children kidnapped and used in sex parties for blackmail purposes
* Clear police involvement, by making errors in their investigations which let perpetrators go free, not following up on leads, etc.
* Police teams being changed, where one police team would be making progress on an investigation, then be dismissed and another police team being brought in which clearly has an agenda to discredit/ignore existing witnesses/evidence
* National or (more rarely) local media discrediting victim-witnesses, calling them liars, following a clear anti-victim agenda
* Judges giving harsh sentences to child witnesses and lenient sentences on perpetrators
* Witnesses and investigators being threatened and intimidated, vehicles malfunctioning, anonymous phone calls, etc
* Witnesses and investigators being murdered, or dying in suspicious circumstances (suicide despite no personal problems, or convenient ""accidents"")

Now ask yourself, what is the one type of organization which can accomplish all of these things? There is only one.

The **secret services**.

The only organization which would have the authority and the means to accomplish all these feats, to assert such a degree of control over all the outcomes, is military intelligence. Other entities may be involved - billionaires for example - but money can only accomplish so much. Yes you can purchase a newspaper and have journalists write something, but you can't just pay someone to murder someone in a prison and make it look like suicide. Prison security need to be moved, clearance needs to be given. People need to be so scared that they keep their mouth shut. The only way you do this is by having significant amounts of money and resources at your disposal, but also *authority* over them.

Here is a collection of evidence supporting this assertion:

1. Epstein flew a helicopter which shared tail numbers with a covert US military helicopter used by [DynCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynCorp). Dyncorp has a history of child trafficking scandals in many countries and is owned by Steve Feinberg (US intelligence board). Epstein's pilot is rumored to be in US intelligence and a Mossad agent, Junkerman, has flown on his jet. [Summary](https://i.redd.it/y6u9zvu4e3f31.png). Epstein's close associate, [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell), is the child of media baron Robert Maxwell, who had links to British, Israeli, and Russian secret service.
Epstein got off very lightly in 2008 for sexually abusing underage girls. The current labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, gave him a very lenient deal. Who can pull the strings to make this happen? Either Acosta is a part of the conspiracy, or another entity was forcing his hand - the only entity that is capable of doing so is military intelligence.
AG William Barr worked in Epstein's legal team. Barr's father, Donald Barr, was in the OSS, which was the precursor to the CIA. Donald Barr gave Epstein his first job as a math teacher in an elite, politically connected school, even though Epstein did not have any qualifications or even a college degree.
And assuming that Epstein didn't commit suicide, whoever had him killed was able to make a murder look like suicide, inside a prison, while the target was under suicide watch. Guards were apparently told to leave the area due to maintenance, and CCTV camera footage was either prevented or confiscated [Source](https://twitter.com/BreakingNLive/status/1160235309596139520). Only military intelligence operatives have the resources to pull this off. Epstein's murder, whether real or faked, was the CIA disposing of a loose asset.

2. It is a documented historical fact that the CIA engaged in child trafficking, including child sexual abuse, to blackmail useful officials, in the [MK Ultra project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). [Source 1](https://www.newsweek.com/project-mkultra-documents-cia-brainwashing-techniques-black-vault-1073061) [Source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn8XMlqcVcg). Note that only a small portion of the documents for this project ever came to light - the majority were destroyed.

3. The Franklin Scandal. The ring leader of the pedophile blackmail ring, Larry King, had ties to US Intelligence. [Source, page 34](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books//4chan_pol_Archives/PDFs/Miscellaneous%20Unsorted/pol/pol%20books%2014%20-%20nov%202016/The%20Franklin%20Scandal%20-%20Nick%20Bryant%20%282009%29.pdf) In a subsequent scandal involving a ""call-boy ring"" in Washington D.C., an associate of King's, Craig Spence, committed suicide in a hotel. The mysterious Spence was ""a CIA asset"" and had bugged his home so he could blackmail powerful people. [Source, page 279](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books//4chan_pol_Archives/PDFs/Miscellaneous%20Unsorted/pol/pol%20books%2014%20-%20nov%202016/The%20Franklin%20Scandal%20-%20Nick%20Bryant%20%282009%29.pdf)

4. Paul Bonacci, who was awarded $1m by a judge for the sexual abuse done to him by Larry King, was also involved in a MK-Ultra follow-up mind control operation called Monarch (also confirmed by other survivors). He directly named [Colonel Michael Aquino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set#Foundation) as one of the leads in the project. Aquino worked for navy intelligence. Around this time, allegations of child sex abuse were being leveled at army bases all over the United States. [Source](http://humansarefree.com/2016/12/the-conspiracy-against-michael-aquino.html). So it seems, at least in the 70s and 80s, there was a dedicated program by the US military for child trafficking, sexual abuse, and mind control.

5. The Belgium Scandal. A key witness, Regina Louf, alleged that convicted child rapist and murderer Marc Dutroux kidnapped children, including her, for businessman Michel Nihoul. Louf alleged that Nihoul had hidden cameras and that she had to make sure her rapists were in the camera's field of view. Louf's allegations were independently corroborated by many other witnesses, many of whom could give intimate case details such as room layouts. Nihoul was found not guilty, after judges overruled the jury's guilty verdict. Louf was also discredited by the Belgian government's own TV station, which labelled her a deranged liar.
The case was the subject of a massive public outcry after police made a huge number of serious mistakes, such as even neglecting to search a basement after children's voices could be heard - this mistake led to the children starving to death in their basement cell. Many witnesses related to the case died in mysterious circumstances, such as committing suicide despite having no personal problems, or having car accidents.[Source 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djmm7GrgsUk) [Source 2](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#12)
Again, which organization has the ability to influence national media, influence senior judges, influence police, and kill people to make it look like suicide or an accident? The security services.

6. The Hampstead cover-up, in which two children related that their father forced them to engage in satanic ritual abuse at their school and at a church, as well as pedophilic parties with their father's friends, including cutting off babies' heads. Babies were supplied to the cult by social services. An experienced police detective is on record saying he believed the children and their mother. The authorities quickly closed ranks on the situation, with a judge removing the children from their mother, which goes against lawful procedure. Medical examinations by experienced professionals proved that the children had been sexually abused (vaginal and anal examinations). Crucial evidence was withheld from hearings. Child protection authorities and the Home Office was silent and inactive. 
To cover up information related to the case, all major media outlets were served with a defense advisory (DA) notice - *a DA notice is an official request to news editors not to publish or broadcast items on specified subjects which would compromise military or intelligence operations*. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwoe2eB-Bo).

7. In 1987 a satanic cult in Washington D.C., the Finders, was investigated after children were seen being apparently trafficked by two well-dressed men. At the properties of the Finders, investigators discovered evidence of satanic ritual abuse, blackmail, sophisticated communication technology, and explosives. The CIA took over the investigation and declared it an ""internal matter"". No further investigation was permitted. [Source](https://youtu.be/33cijzHhPow?t=2241)

8. Ronald Bernard confesses in an emotional interview about having to sacrifice children to prove yourself as a psychopath in the financial elite. He also says that ""secret services are actually criminal organizations ... they will stop at nothing. They have their flows of money from trading drugs, weapons, people. All that money has to come from somewhere, everything has to be financed."" [Source](https://youtu.be/xC62iJ_oXDE?t=1101)

9. The Jersey scandal (full breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aq8935/we_need_to_talk_about_the_island_of_jersey/)). A policeman, Lenny Harper, investigating a children's care home (which Jimmy Savile frequently visited), claims he recovered forensic evidence that children were killed and incinerated in the basement. In March 2008, BBC television personality Jimmy Savile started legal proceedings against The Sun newspaper which had, wrongly he claimed, linked him in several articles to the child abuse scandal at Haut de la Garenne. Savile initially denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted that he had done so, following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children. The States of Jersey Police said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.
The forensic evidence found on the site was repeatedly compromised when it was sent to the UK for analysis. Lenny Harper received many death threats and was attacked by Jersey's local media, and some national media outlets. A journalist who later tried to investigate was arrested, held for 12 hours at Heathrow airport, and banned from the island. [Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xd4954/the-journalist-who-was-banned-from-investigating-jerseys-child-abuse)
The list of suspects in the case include British government officials. According to Harper, Chief Minister for Jersey Frank Walker (OBE) warned Harper that his investigation could ""bring the government down"".
In September 2008, the investigation team was changed. David Warcup, the leader of the new team, said there was ""no evidence"" that children were killed at Haut and that Harper's information he gave to the press were not accurate. Warcup said that the bones were animal bones and that the 60 milk teeth had come out naturally. [Telegraph article 2](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3446619/Jersey-police-chief-suspended-as-claims-of-child-murders-ripped-up.html) The new team also claimed that a child's skull was actually a piece of coconut (citing no scientific analysis), going against statements made by two anthropologists that it was a skull fragment as it contained collagen, and moreover that it was ""fleshed and fresh"" when it had been burned. [Source](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3446619/Jersey-police-chief-suspended-as-claims-of-child-murders-ripped-up.html) Warcup said that the bones which were found could have been hundreds of years old, however an expert told Harper that they could only be a few decades old. [Source 2](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/jersey-probe-lenny-harper-hits-back-28454432.html)
MP John Hemming said that he had no doubt that there were efforts to cover up the murder evidence. [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7534350.stm)

10. A man called Carl Beech claimed that in the 70s and 80s he and a number of other boys were raped by powerful people in London. He made claims specifically against twelve people, including the former Members of Parliament Harvey Proctor (who had already been convicted of gross indecency for having sex with teenage boys) and Greville Janner, the former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, the former Prime Minister Edward Heath, the former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Bramall, the former Director of the Secret Intelligence Service Maurice Oldfield, and the former Director-General of MI5 Michael Hanley. Beech claimed that he was abused at a number of places including Dolphin Square, the Carlton Club, and various other places in the Home Counties. Beech also falsely claimed that the group murdered three children: two for sexual pleasure, and a third to intimidate the others. Proctor's solicitors told him that Beech had alleged that he had seen Proctor repeatedly stab a 12-year-old boy before strangling him to death, and that he himself had been raped by Proctor.
The officer leading the investigation, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald, said in December 2014 that experienced officers had concluded that the allegations were ""credible and true"". McDonald was later criticised for the statement, and it was retracted. The investigating team was changed, no further evidence was found, and Beech was sentenced to 19 years in prison. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midland)

11. Natacha Jaitt, a playboy model, alleged that she had evidence of a VIP child abuse ring, involving journalists and politicians in Argentina. She tweeted that ""Notice: I will not commit suicide. I won’t be bought off or drown in a bath tub, nor will I shoot myself in the head. So, if that happens: I wasn’t me. Save this tweet."" She was later found dead of an apparent drug overdose - her lawyer and brother suspect foul play. [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/26/model-tried-expose-paedophile-ring-found-dead-8744960/)

12. Former police officer Mark Minnie wrote an explosive book detailing a pedophile ring in South African government. Minnie, 58, was found with a bullet to his head, but many people are refusing to believe the police version - that he took his own life at the farm of a friend near the coastal city of Port Elizabeth.
""The fact that the suicide note was found doesn't necessarily mean he wrote it willingly. I mean he could've written it under duress. The fact that he shot himself with someone else's pistol already raises questions,"" investigative journalist and author Jacques Pauw told South Africa's radio 702. [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45195756)

13. Imane Fadil was a Moroccan ex-model who became a celebrity after becoming a key witness in the 2013 “Rubygate” trials which accused the media mogul and ex-Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi of “child prostitution”. Fadil was also looking to be a witness in a related investigation (dubbed “Ruby ter”) that is still ongoing.
In 2018, Fadil claimed in an interview that Berlusconi’s infamous “parties” lead to dark, satanic rituals. She was also in the process of writing a tell-all book about Rubygate and the dark secrets of Berlusconi. The name of the projected book was quite evocative: I Met the Devil.
However, in the past weeks, things dramatic turn. Imane Fadil died in a hospital room in Milan on March 1st after a month of agony. Media sources reported her death only 15 days after the fact, mostly because authorities announced the opening of a homicide investigation. Indeed, the cause of Fadil’s death is currently believed to be “murder by radioactive poisoning”.

They're like Denace the Menace only they have machine guns.

John Potash writes in his acclaimed book ""Drugs as Weapons Against Us"" that the CIA's Project SPAN involved ""the 1951 aerosol spraying of LSD on the town of Pont-St. Esprit, France, which resulted in several deaths and many injuries.""

The CIA also tested anthrax-like spores in various American cities, and may have used actual anthrax during the Korean War.  Maybe I'll write about this later, or someone else will I hope.

Anyone else suddenly seeing military helicopters flying overhead for the first time?  I remember in 1990 in the buildup to Papa Bush's Desert Storm incursion into Kuwait to fight Iraqi troops (remember Papa Bush never did invade Iraq, just entered Kuwait) that I'd see day after day lots of military truck traffic on South Kingshighway as I would drive to Forest Park and Washington University's library.  

I've lived in the same house for 25 years, and I've never once seen military helicopters flying around.  Maybe once every 2 to 6 months, I'll hear and see fast-moving military jets and planes high above, but never helicopters.  On Monday and Tuesday of this week, I suddenly saw low-flying copters for the very first time.  On Monday, a big copter was flying south-southwest, possibly flying directly over my house or pretty close.  Then Tuesday, I heard and saw a military helicopter a few minutes before 11 AM flying in the exact opposite direction (north-northeast).  I don't recall the color of Monday's copter but Tuesday's had a brown bottom.  Never seen copters in this suburb of St. Louis prior to this week.  I wonder what's up.  

I hope the Deep State hasn't blackmailed or forced Trump into invading Syria.  I haven't had a reason in months to drive on South Kingshighway, so I don't know if there's lots of military truck movements there again like in 1990.  

I hope them copters ain't spraying cancer chemicals over my house. Lol.  Just kidding.  But again, the CIA, in an experiment, did spray LSD over an unsuspecting French town in the 1950s to see what would happen.  And a few people actually died.  I'm sure the U.S. Junta got permission from the French Junta to use the town in the experiment.  After all, the CIA helped install the secret French Junta in the 1950s and they nearly brought down French Premiere Charles DeGaulle in 1962 or so.  DeGaulle went on the radio urging French citizens to come out onto the streets in massive demonstations to resist the combined CIA and French Junta overthrow of his government (I read that years ago in William Blum's book, ""The CIA: A Forgotten History"").  Similarly, we saw just last year Turkey's elected leader implore Turkish citizens to come out and demonstrate against the CIA-supported Turkish military coup that tried to overthrow the Turkish government in a coup last summer.  And Turkey has always been a U.S. ally.

Man, the CIA has too much time and money on its hands.  Time to close them down.  Congress should grow a spine and de-fund these anti-democratic CIA fascists before they cause even more harm to our country and the world.",conspiracy,CIA

[http://csglobe.com/escobar-son-dad-worked-cia-cocaine/](http://csglobe.com/escobar-son-dad-worked-cia-cocaine/) FEB 22, 2017

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo\_Escobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar)

Juan Pablo Escobar Henao, son of notorious Medellín cartel drug kingpin, Pablo Escobar, now says his father ***“worked for the CIA.”***

In a new book, “Pablo Escobar In Fraganti,” Escobar, who lives under the pseudonym, Juan Sebastián Marroquín, [explains](http://www.noticias24.com/internacionales/noticia/121173/mi-papa-trabajaba-para-la-cia-afirma-hijo-de-pablo-escobar-en-entrevista/) his *“father* ***worked for the CIA selling cocaine to finance the fight against Communism in Central America.”***

*“The drug business is very different than what we dreamed,”* he continues.

*“What the CIA was doing was buying the controls to get the drug into their country and getting a wonderful deal.”*

\*“He did not make the money alone,”\*Marroquín [elaborated](http://www.elintransigente.com/sociedad/2017/2/16/juan-pablo-escobar-mi-papa-quiso-secuestrar-michael-jackson-423405.html) in an interview, ***“but with US agencies that allowed him access to this money.***

***He had direct relations with the CIA.”***

Notably, Marroquín added, ***“the person who sold the most drugs to the CIA was Pablo Escobar.”***

Where his first book primarily covered Escobar, the man as a father, Marroquín’s second — which has just been released in Argentina — delves into the kingpin’s *“international ties of corruption in which my father had an active participation, among them with the American CIA,”* he [said](http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/hijo-pablo-escobar-no-tengo-dudas-que-mi-padre-se-suicido-n4114981) in a recent interview.

Those government associates ***“were practically his partners,”*** which allowed Escobar to defy the law, and gave him nearly the same power as a government.

Predictably, this information is conveniently absent from media headlines in America.

If the CIA trafficking cocaine into the United States sounds like some tin foil conspiracy theory, think again. Their alleged role in the drug trade was exposed in 1996 in an explosive investigative series “Dark Alliance” by Gary Webb for the San Jose Mercury News.

The investigation, headed up by Webb revealed ties between the CIA, Nicaraguan contras and the crack cocaine trade ravaging African-American communities.

The investigation provoked massive protests and congressional hearings, as well as overt backlash from the mainstream media to discredit Webb’s reporting. However, decades later, [officials would come forward](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/10/gary-webb-dark-alliance_n_5961748.html) to back Webb’s original investigation up.

Then-senator John Kerry even released [a detailed report](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/north06.pdf) claiming that not only was there “considerable evidence” linking the Contra effort to trafficking of drugs and weapons — **but that the U.S. government knew about it.**

El Patron, as Escobar came to be known, amassed more wealth than almost any drug dealer in history — at one point raking in around $420 million a week in revenue — and reportedly supplied about 80 percent of the world’s cocaine.

Escobar [landed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2015/09/15/watching-netflixs-narcos-heres-pablo-escobar-in-forbes-first-ever-billionaire-issue-in-1987/#716bdc7479e9) on *Forbes*’ list of international billionaires for seven straight years, and — though the nature of the business makes acquiring solid numbers impossible — his [estimated](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#1-in-the-mid-1980s-escobars-cartel-brought-in-an-estimated-420-million-a-week-which-totals-almost-22-billion-a-year-1) worth was around $30 billion.

Escobar and the Medellín cartel [smuggled](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#8-once-he-started-a-fire-with-2-million-because-his-daughter-was-cold-8) 15 tons of cocaine into the U.S. — *every day* — and left a trail of thousands of dead bodies to do so.

*“It was a nine-hundred-mile run from the north coast of Colombia and was simply wide-open,”* journalist Ioan Grillo wrote in the book, “El Narco: Inside Mexico’s Criminal Insurgency.”

*“The Colombians and their American counterparts would airdrop loads of blow out to sea, from where it would be rushed ashore in speedboats, or even fly it right onto the Florida mainland and let it crash down in the countryside.”*

If what Marroquín reveals in the new book is, indeed, true, it would mean the [CIA played a major role in ensuring Americans had access to boundless quantities of cocaine](http://csglobe.com/two-cia-agents-arrested-by-minutemen-while-crossing-mexican-border-with-1300-pounds-of-cocaine/) — while the U.S. government sanctimoniously railed against drugs to promote the drug war.

In fact, as Marroquín keenly observes, **drug prohibition makes for the best pro-drug propaganda** — the nature of something being illegal naturally gives it greater appeal.

The official number is staggering, but the shadow books sum is far larger. These funds are primarily being used as CIA black ops money laundering and kickbacks to D.C. politicians and various assets and entities.

Congress is the only government entity that may vote for war. It has not voted for a single war since WW2. Thus, all of the wars since Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and every other war America has been engaged in have all been illegal.

America is currently illegally engaged in a proxy war with Russia. This too is illegal.

Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for even a cent of money to be sent to foreign nations for their wars. This is theft.

The illegitimate Federal government operating out of the foreign nation of Washington, D.C. is illegally stealing the fruits of We the People’s labors via their fraudulent agency known as the IRS. The government does not need this money. No matter what percent of taxes is stolen, the government is equally as insolvent and spending at a similar rate.

Taxation is nothing more than [social engineering](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/original-social-engineering-sin) to control and ultimately prematurely murder Americans.

For some perspective on the more recent crime sprees of this fraudulent and sociopathic “government”:

* $100 billion dollars distributed to poor Americans would more or less eradicate poverty\*
* $100 billion dollars distributed to homeless Americans would more or less eradicate homelessness\*
* the $80 billion recently allocated to the unconstitutional IRS and their new army of armed goons that have no [legal powers](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/memorandum-of-law-the-legality-of) to steal direct un-apportioned monies via “taxes” (i.e. “income” taxes) from Americans would eradicate most if not all poverty and/or homelessness in America\*.

Let that sink in: $80 billion stolen from you to fund more theft from you that simultaneously steals away productive GDP and as such decimates the main economic driving forces. The middle class and poor will become poorer thanks to the money that was stolen from them in the first place. Talk about a viciously depraved and wholly unconstitutional feedback loop.

But alas, this latest IRS scam serves to reinforce the WEF and UN Great Reset agenda perfectly, because this illegitimate government is only beholden to the One World Government which necessitates the destruction of the American populace it pretends to serve. The $100 billion in Ukrainian “war” money is just their fuck you money slush fund that is also being used indirectly and directly against We the People.

The only way to survive this criminally out of control government is to offer total nonviolent noncompliance in every facet of our lives. This must be done en masse, and done now.

Do NOT comply.

When denied the requested information, Eisenhower allegedly authorized a personal message that the agent and his immediate superior would deliver to those in charge at Area 51 and S-4. [The message was a direct threat that the President would authorize a military invasion of Area 51 and S-4 if his request for information was not carried out.](https://youtu.be/c--gGcsc4aw) (start at 11:17 to get to the following threat...)

> **We called the people in from MJ-12, from Area 51 and S-4, but they told us that the government had no jurisdiction over what they were doing…. I want you and your boss to fly out there. I want you to give them a personal message…. I want you to tell them, whoever is in charge, I want you to tell them that they have this coming week to get into Washington and to report to me. And if they don’t, I’m going to get the First Army from Colorado. we are going to go over and take the base over. I don’t care what kind of classified material you got. We are going to rip this thing apart!**

What he later was told about Area 51 and S4 motivated Eisenhower to give his departing Military-Industrial Complex speech in January 1961.

Edit: Another (and in my view, less believable) story says that Nixon also demanded information about the projects at Area 51 and if any of them could be used in Vietnam.

He was repeatedly denied any information, and one night, while inebriated, he received a report again denying his request. In a fit of Rage, he called the director of the CIA into the Oval Office and demanded to know why the Commander of all armed forces couldn't be told about US military assets being developed or tested at Area 51, regardless of their origins.

The story goes that CIA director told Nixon some things are best left alone and he didnt have a need to know about anything happening at Area 51.

Henry Kissinger, National Security Advisor for Nixon was sleeping at the time of this exchange but was woke by a phone call and told Nixon wanted him in the Oval Office, ASAP.

When Kissinger arrived, he found a very angry Nixon and a oddly disinterested CIA director in the Oval Office. The CIA director said he didnt understand why Kissinger was there as it wouldn't change his mind.

**Nixon, ignoring the CIA director's comment, asked Kissinger how the USSR would react if the USA would perform an above ground test of the largest Strategic Nuclear Weapon the US had in their arsenal near the old Atomic test sites in Nevada, say over Groom Lake, in the next hour.**  

I never hear about the rest of that exchange, but Nixon, the story goes, received a full briefing and stopped asking about anything at A51 after that.",conspiracy,CIA

That same night Jeffery Epstein flew [his private jet to Saudi Arabia](https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh-saudi-arabia-private-jet-2019-9), where he reportedly met with soon to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The meeting was about [Saudi Vision 2030](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en), which is Saudi Arabia's version of [UN Agenda 2030](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda). Epstein was very familiar with both of these initiatives as he was a member of the [Trilateral Commission who drafted the original version](https://archive.is/Sqbno) of the initiative known as Agenda 21. It is believed that these initiatives are behind the chaos we are currently living.

Trump spent his early days in office becoming friendly with Saudi Arabia, building strong relationships with its elite and [touching creepy orbs](https://i.imgur.com/1xAOQba.jpg) with them. In June of 2017 Mohammed bin Salman was [appointed Crown Prince](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed/531075/), and Trump wasted no time in congratulating him. Not everyone in SA was pleased with MBS being named crown prince, most notably prince al-Waleed bin Talal...who owned a soon to be important piece of real estate in Las Vegas.

Fast forward to October 1st 2017, when the infamous Harvest Music Festival Shooting occurred. The official story is lone gunman Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. You may remember that the story kept changing in the days that followed, and if you build off the police scanner and 911 calls ([which this website does a great job of](https://www.intellihub.com/timeline-of-hell-las-vegas-shooting/)) the story changes to multiple shooters forcing their way up the strip, shooting into multiple hotels. Also worth noting, the floors above where Paddock allegedly shot from are actually part of ""[The Four Seasons](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-guide/las-vegas-nevada/hotels/four-seasons-at-mandalay-bay)"" a separate hotel [owned by prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Bill Gates](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/13/2) (another big Agenda 2030 player) [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b1kzk/the_las_vegas_shooting_and_the_mass_arrests_in/) does a great job breaking down the Saudi involvement theory in detail. If you're looking for a TLDR instead, the theory is that Paddock was an arms dealer and personal pilot for prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who ordered an assassination on MBS who was in Vegas at the time. When the hit team realized they were compromised they killed Paddock and began shooting from his window to create a diversion. They then made there way through the chaos on the streets in an attempt to escape. This is backed up by the infamous video (which youtube kept removing) that showed a man who resembled [MBS being escorted out of the Tropicana](https://i.imgur.com/yQQW02R.png) by an armed security team. This becomes more plausible when you consider that a few weeks later Kushner made an [unannounced visit to Saudi Arabia](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/29/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-244291) which was followed by [MBS arresting several princes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html), including prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

About a year later, the news of Jammal Khashoggi's assassination broke, and fingers were immediately pointed at MBS ([something the media is hammering down toda](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html)y) Jammal Khashoggi isn't the most famous in his family though, as his uncle Adnan Khashoggi was a big time arms dealer. He had many powerful friends, one being Donald Trump, who bought [Adnan's yacht in 1987](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/trump-princess-inside-donald-trumps-lavish-86m-superyacht--34381). Around that same time Adnan Khashoggi was [involved in the Iran Contra](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=530172b9-7e7a-4933-acbc-f864f683863a) scandal with another power and familiar friend...

Fast forward to August 2019, when news broke of Jeffery Epstein's arrest. When the FBI searched his home, they found a safe full of money, diamonds, and a fake passport. The passport had Epstein's picture with a fake name, and had his residence [listed as being in Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB49DABQHs). Shortly after Vicky Ward appeared on MSNBC and claimed to have [sources that prove Epstein and Adnan's business together](https://youtu.be/Ip7VmFyGy-s?t=436), and hinted at Epstein's involvement in the Iran Contra scandal.

It is probably worth noting that a month later Jeff Bezos' phone was [hacked by crown prince MBS](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/21/21075990/saudi-arabia-crown-pince-mbs-amazon-jeff-bezos), who allegedly gained access to Bezos' phone through a Whatsapp file.

Then there's Bill Gates, which I could write a post longer than this one is so far about his shadiness. We already connected him to prince al-Waleed bin Talal, but he also has extensive ties to Jeffery Epstein. Gates denied meeting with Epstein, [despite proven records of them meeting several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnKQ4tzg7ow), including after Epstein's conviction. A lot of [money was secretly transferred](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-jeffrey-epstein-friendship-swedish-mother-daughter-meeting-2019-10) between the 2 of them, and Gate's science advisor [Boris Nikolic was named to be named backup executor of Epstein will](https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-will-bill-gates-ex-science-adviser-boris-nikolic-named-executor) 2 days before his death. Little is known about their connection, they both share a common interest in eugenics, and both had a hand in planning UN Agenda 2030. Everything else is left up to the imagination.

So if this is all connected, what was Trumps role in it, and which side was he on? He appeared to be friendly with all of these people in his early days ([pictured here with Adnan Khashoggi and Ghislanes father Robert Maxwell](https://i.imgur.com/W5uLbcY.jpg)) But in more recent years he seemed to distant himself from them. He allegedly [kicked Epstein out of Mar Lago over inappropriate behavior](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/trump-banned-jeffrey-epstein-from-mar-a-lago-for-hitting-on-girl.html), and all of them were arrested when he took office. He also seemed to declare he will not be partaking in Agenda 2030 when he told the UN General Assembly [""the future does not belong to globalists""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wJ8tdxDVgI) Maybe he turned on them, and all of these events were part of a ""battle of the elite"" that had been raging through his time in office.

Propaganda also has an alternate use that is becoming much more prevalent now that the internet has opened up the floodgates of information: To get people to distrust information altogether. 

This excerpt from a recent reddit post I came across says it well: 


""Modern propaganda works by getting you to believe nothing. It's like lowering the defenses of your immune system. If they can get you to believe that all the news is propaganda, then all of a sudden propaganda from foreign-controlled state media or sourceless loony toon rants from domestic kooks, are all on an equal playing field with real investigative journalism. If everything is fake, your news consumption is just a dietary choice."" 

* Source - https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/


This is how the masses are confused in to silence, by flooding all the forums with nonsense. It's infuriating, and it's designed to make your fury override your logic. This pushes people in to a more base animal-like response, because they are highly emotional and as a result their sense of logic is limited. 


""In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and nothing was true. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."" - Hannah Arendt

If every time you try to discuss a certain topic it quickly dissolves in to an clickbait trollfest, then that not only limits everyone's ability to discuss that topic, but it also creates an association in your mind that will prevent you from thinking about that idea because you associate it with those unpleasant emotions and that unpleasant situation, and you might never bring it up not only on forums but in real life too. 

So any topic that the powerful don't want us to talk about, _or any source they don't want us to trust_, they can flood the associated discussions with half-baked assertions that seem looney, but now with social media they can also be upvoted to appear as if they are popular public opinion, creating a false public consensus. For example I saw this today: 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtA0u4-rFLw 

On what should be a relatively benign interview about space, the top youtube comments are all flat earth nonsense with 30 upvotes and an anti-masonic association to give them a veneer of credibility. In the first few hours of the video being up. If you stand back and look at it, it makes more sense that people are trying to make RT look like an invalid news source, than it is that 50 vocal flat earthers found the video in the first few hours and heavily upvoted each other, doesn't it? It's not that people are losing their minds, it's that the people losing control of the message _want_ us to think that everyone is losing their minds, so we don't trust _anything_. ""Don't trust RT, insane people hang out here."" is the message. If done across _all_ media sources, then we're completely immobilized, because nothing seems true. It seems like we're surrounded by lies, so we trust nothing. This is a form of control. This is the next level of PR now that the message control is failing. I am certain people have experienced similar cage-rattling emotionally overwhelming media environments in past war-time eras, but today we have the unique ability to be lied to through the social media, where it has an additional appearance of legitimacy to us because we believe the opinions to be crowd-sourced. But perhaps this is also the thinking of those who watch TV and listened to radio during WW1. ""They wouldn't air it unless people wanted it, right?"" The game has changed, but the strategy has not. 

However, we have the distinct advantage of being able to express ourselves to the world public through posts like this, whereas the TV and Radio generations couldn't just make their own stations. This is huge. This battle for trust has been waging for some time now, in the background. We should be bringing it to the foreground, so we can understand what is happening to our media and our minds. I can't help but think of the quote:

""We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."" - William Casey, CIA Director, 1981

They're trying to game the signal-to-noise ratio to drown out the signal. The only solution is to make the signal louder by broadcasting our voices, and to get better at recognizing the causes of the noise. The more we recognize their game, the less it works and the more quickly we can disassemble it. We _can_ do this. ",conspiracy,CIA

Now I know that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so in this post I'm trying to make an argument, not to prove this claim, but to show that it is worthy of considering. I am also just briefly going over each section because I am trying to connect this to our history as a species. I might make a separate post for each topic.

One point I just want to make before I bring some 'evidence' is that there are thousands of videos of random people doing acts that seem to defy the laws of physics as we know it but in this age of internet, they are all discarded because they are assumed to be fake. At what point, is there too many, for us to start looking deeper into smart, educated people that risk their reputation by making wild claims?

**Remote viewing has been statistically given some validation through statistical means and** [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrwAiU2g5RU) **is a video of the Professor of Statistics at UC Irvine speaking on this** validation in controlled environments. There has also been CIA funded projects into remote viewing which Russell Targ can be seen talking about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY). There is much more on this but that will be another post.

[**1 in 3 people**](https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2017/10/31/1-3-americans-feel-they-have-experienced-psychic-m) **claim to have had a psychic experience.** Everybody has these experiences that science really cant explain, when a mom gets a gut feeling and calls her son to find out that he was in a crash crash or when you are thinking of someone and they call you randomly? I hear these stories all the time and they are always brushed aside. How do we know we aren't doing ourselves a disservice by not investigating such claims? For example, [here](https://youtu.be/s6lnEIGyz0Q?t=461), it is so interweaven into our society that we just know certain things, or have a feeling about things that we shouldn't even know, that nobody bats an eye.

And for those who speak on the Randi Challenge, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdXZdsRzDDk) is someone who I thought did a good video of him. **And even** [**Princeton did a study on the effects of the mind on outcomes**](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ppvxz8/this-ivy-league-physics-lab-believes-humans-have-mind-control-abilities-943) and they concluded ""with the human/machine anomalies, we conducted thousands of experiments with millions of trials along these lines. Overall the result was that there were small, but consistent, shifts in the means of these output distributions that could not be attributed to chance. "" There are many experiments that show that the mind has an affect on matter. Quantum Mechanics (I know this is quoted for the strangest claims but It belongs here) also could validate telekinesis and other mind matter interactions.

So here is where the road gets rocky.... [many people have doubted the validity of our version of human development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w7gzIQAHf0). Why are there maps that show the coastline of Antarctica before we had the technology to do so? Why do the Pyramids get less complex as time goes? Why are there the same depictions throughout ancient civilizations that were separated by large oceans which suggests connectivity? WHY do so many indigenous cultures speak of ""gods"" coming down and teaching them knowledge on how to farm etc. WHY is there no depictions of the pyramids in Egyptian hieroglyphics and drawings? [Why are there so many inconsistency with the timing of the pyramids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7UmGEMduI8)? This and much much more backs up Graham Hancock's theory that, we are a species with amnesia. That we were hit with a comet which took us out of the ice age and into the younger Dryas period. This Younger Dryas period was apocalyptical to a level that hard to even comprehend. The whole of our past was murked by floods fires and many changes that our planet went over. The people that survived from the past civilization tried to restart civilization again by going to groups of hunters and gatherers and teaching them agriculture and helped them build gobekli tepe. The restart of civilization then mainly failed because it did not take us back to our true past, but it gave us a boost in our civilization.

**How is it that we with all our knowledge today, we cannot TRULY figure out how the pyramids were build before we even used the wheel? HOW is there so little acknowledgement that the pyramids have** [Electromagnetic properties](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018JAP...124c4903B/abstract)? **What if, our ancient ancestors had knowledge that is lost to us now. Knowledge that allowed them to utilize these psychic skills in order to have a society that didn't require money but still allowed them to build grand structures. Which allowed them to move stones that each weighed 2 tons across vast distances? Could it be possible that we were once a great civilization, but one that knew each induvial to be powerful? One that was in tune with nature so much that we never felt the need to cut down forests or build cities? Maybe at that point then hit with a comet which caused the Younger** **Dryas period which restarted humanities progress. After this humanity had infinite paths to venture on and we chose the one that brought along the industrial revolution and the killing of our planets lungs.**

I know there are many gaps and leaps in this theory but I just want to have a discussion on this because its been on my mind.

One more thing: If this field interests you, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyDYHpLpCys) is one more video from a documentary. Just this video alone makes you wonder, what if we are missing something vital in our medical practices? Chi gong is an ancient practice that claims that there is energy flowing through us at all times. There has been even a [woman](https://www.licencetogrow.ca/scientists-witness-woman-with-exceptional-powers-of-mind-rapidly-grow-a-plant-from-a-seed/) who was studied who can speed up the growth of a seed through chi. So this makes you wonder, what are we missing in our agricultural practices, which have became artificial?

**Edit**: Someone commented that I am misunderstanding the [study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018JAP...124c4903B/abstract) on electromagnetic properties of the Great Pyramid.

Here is my response: I am not saying the Great Pyramid stays charged, just that is does get charged and concentrates energy. There is much more that I can speak on about the pyramids. This model takes into account the shafts INSIDE the pyramids, not just any random pyramid shape. Saying that any big rock can have these properties doesn't truly do it justice.

I am not just relying on this article only either. Almost all the materials used in the Great Pyramid of Giza have specific electrical properties. The Dolomite used on the inner surfaces is great for conducting electricity. The granite used in the internal passageways is slightly radioactive which could allow it to ""charge"" or electrify the air. Tura Limestone covered the entire exterior beforethieves and earthquakes got rid of it. Tura Limestone is an electrical insulated material. Archeologists also believe that there used to be a capstone made of gold which is another material with strong electrical properties. The whole design of this Pyramids bears likeness to a machine, one that incorporates water into its designs which could be why is was built by water. Some of the shafts are so small it makes more sense that it was built for water and not human travel.

I could also get into the fact that there are tunnels and caves beneath the Pyramids. The Pyramid is built on top of a powerful location of underground electricity. The area that it is sitting on top of is in a strong area filled with [telleric](https://www.britannica.com/science/telluric-current) energy because of the cave complex underneath it. **It isn't crazy to propose that we can optimize the telleric currents as** [**we have used it as a conductor to our earliest telegraphs.**](http://web.mst.edu/~kosbar/ee3430/ff/Wireless/noise2/telluric.html) **and are also considering** [**doing it again**](https://www.upsbatterycenter.com/blog/earth-batteries/) The Pyramids are also at the center of the earths landmass. Directly in the center of the land mass through which the telluric current travels through. Now you are telling me that when we also learn about how the Pyramids concentrate energy, we shouldn't investigate? Nikola Tesla and Isaac newton thought it was worth investigation. My main point is that, at some point things pile up to an extent where it requires investigation or consideration.",conspiracy,CIA

>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.

>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.

>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.

>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.

>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”

>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.

>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”

>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.

>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”

>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.

>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.

>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”

>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.

>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.

>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”

>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.

>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.

>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.

>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”

>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).

>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”

>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?

>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.

>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.

>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.

>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”

>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.

>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”

>Correction: February 18, 2018
>An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.

In a new book, “Pablo Escobar In Fraganti,” Escobar, who lives under the pseudonym, Juan Sebastián Marroquín, [explains](http://www.noticias24.com/internacionales/noticia/121173/mi-papa-trabajaba-para-la-cia-afirma-hijo-de-pablo-escobar-en-entrevista/) his *“father* ***worked for the CIA selling cocaine to finance the fight against Communism in Central America.”***

*“The drug business is very different than what we dreamed,”* he continues.

*“What the CIA was doing was buying the controls to get the drug into their country and getting a wonderful deal.”*

\*“He did not make the money alone,”\*Marroquín [elaborated](http://www.elintransigente.com/sociedad/2017/2/16/juan-pablo-escobar-mi-papa-quiso-secuestrar-michael-jackson-423405.html) in an interview, ***“but with US agencies that allowed him access to this money.***

***He had direct relations with the CIA.”***

Notably, Marroquín added, ***“the person who sold the most drugs to the CIA was Pablo Escobar.”***

Where his first book primarily covered Escobar, the man as a father, Marroquín’s second — which has just been released in Argentina — delves into the kingpin’s *“international ties of corruption in which my father had an active participation, among them with the American CIA,”* he [said](http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/hijo-pablo-escobar-no-tengo-dudas-que-mi-padre-se-suicido-n4114981) in a recent interview.

Those government associates ***“were practically his partners,”*** which allowed Escobar to defy the law, and gave him nearly the same power as a government.

Predictably, this information is conveniently absent from media headlines in America.

If the CIA trafficking cocaine into the United States sounds like some tin foil conspiracy theory, think again. Their alleged role in the drug trade was exposed in 1996 in an explosive investigative series “Dark Alliance” by Gary Webb for the San Jose Mercury News.

The investigation, headed up by Webb revealed ties between the CIA, Nicaraguan contras and the crack cocaine trade ravaging African-American communities.

The investigation provoked massive protests and congressional hearings, as well as overt backlash from the mainstream media to discredit Webb’s reporting. However, decades later, [officials would come forward](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/10/gary-webb-dark-alliance_n_5961748.html) to back Webb’s original investigation up.

Then-senator John Kerry even released [a detailed report](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/north06.pdf) claiming that not only was there “considerable evidence” linking the Contra effort to trafficking of drugs and weapons — **but that the U.S. government knew about it.**

El Patron, as Escobar came to be known, amassed more wealth than almost any drug dealer in history — at one point raking in around $420 million a week in revenue — and reportedly supplied about 80 percent of the world’s cocaine.

Escobar [landed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2015/09/15/watching-netflixs-narcos-heres-pablo-escobar-in-forbes-first-ever-billionaire-issue-in-1987/#716bdc7479e9) on *Forbes*’ list of international billionaires for seven straight years, and — though the nature of the business makes acquiring solid numbers impossible — his [estimated](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#1-in-the-mid-1980s-escobars-cartel-brought-in-an-estimated-420-million-a-week-which-totals-almost-22-billion-a-year-1) worth was around $30 billion.

Escobar and the Medellín cartel [smuggled](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#8-once-he-started-a-fire-with-2-million-because-his-daughter-was-cold-8) 15 tons of cocaine into the U.S. — *every day* — and left a trail of thousands of dead bodies to do so.

*“It was a nine-hundred-mile run from the north coast of Colombia and was simply wide-open,”* journalist Ioan Grillo wrote in the book, “El Narco: Inside Mexico’s Criminal Insurgency.”

*“The Colombians and their American counterparts would airdrop loads of blow out to sea, from where it would be rushed ashore in speedboats, or even fly it right onto the Florida mainland and let it crash down in the countryside.”*

If what Marroquín reveals in the new book is, indeed, true, it would mean the [CIA played a major role in ensuring Americans had access to boundless quantities of cocaine](http://csglobe.com/two-cia-agents-arrested-by-minutemen-while-crossing-mexican-border-with-1300-pounds-of-cocaine/) — while the U.S. government sanctimoniously railed against drugs to promote the drug war.

In fact, as Marroquín keenly observes, **drug prohibition makes for the best pro-drug propaganda** — the nature of something being illegal naturally gives it greater appeal.

And one we all need to unite on. Let me start by focusing on you, the person reading this. I want to say, from a complete internet stranger that I love you and I want the best for you. Because you are another aspect of myself, and deserve love and safety just as much as I do. You are my fellow man, and I do not care what skin color you have as you read these words or what view points of reality you have. You are a brother. You are a sister. We are a family. We are a human family. We are a creative powerful species capable of amazing feats when we come together. We bicker, we fight. We struggle, we compete. We survive. We do what we must in a world ripe with negativity. But in the end, when everything settles, creative light and love are at the core of who we are. We are meant to love one another, not hurt each other. We have the potentials for so much abundance for all, but a select group of power thirsty power over others, service to self group of psychopaths are not satisfied with what they have and always seek more. This is what greed is. Truly advanced technologies that could benefit all of mankind, suppressed because it would put these ""elites"" out of control and power. We no longer need to call them elite, for they are not. They are scum of the earth and are in direct harm to mankind itself and wish nothing more than for us to destroy ourselves while they laugh on the side lines.

These are the powers that were. The cabal. The Illuminati. The Shadow Government. Names come and go, but their dark tentacles linger in the shadows.

Their gig is up. Their time is over. The show is up for them and they know it. This is a Spiritual Play of Cosmic proportions and we are all actors in one giant awakening and remembering of divine consciousness and remembrance of what and who we are. Their negativity, control, fear, and war has done a toll on this earth, but it also back fired on them. When you go so far into the darkness, it only makes it that much easier to snap back into the light. We have been held in a dark quagmire for so long, have felt the emptiness of what dark truly is, and have made our collective choice to wake the fuck up and move the fuck on from this barbaric system we have constructed. Total chaos it may look like to all of us looking at reality right now. The truth is, change is always happening, and for a new reality that we all collectively want to happen, all old negative belief systems of control and patterns must break down. I have posted many times about the Mayan Calendar and how the 2012 end times scare was truly a new birth of consciousness for man kind. A golden age of consciousness if you will. This has been heavily documented and researched and has been a pretty interesting topic of discussion. 

You may ask where I am going with all of this. What I am leading up to. When you make the personal choice to start finding the truth of our reality, things happen. Synchronicity, Mandela Effect, Law of Attraction, Numerology. You begin to notice patterns and realize things are a lot more connected than you realize and there is a hidden world all around us that we cannot see.

I love quoting Nikola Tesla to make a comparison for this. 

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.""

We all exist on a certain frequency or wave length. Our bodies are dialed into this third dimensional time frame of existence. We all resonate to this frequency, thus we are all in tune with each other and the third dimension itself. If you have heard of Mass Consciousness, it ties into this. This is why group meditations can be so powerful. 

Now, think about if you truly knew the truth of our reality, and could manipulate that global consciousness to your own will. Like a few Border Collies slowly leading a group of sheep in a direction. I hate using the sheep analogy but I hope I am providing a picture for you here. 

Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let's others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others. The Law of One is what this understanding is. Because we are behind a veil of amnesia, and do not truly know or remember everything we have experienced, it makes this illusionary reality seem ""real"" it makes it seem like you are your body and nothing more. It makes it so easy to think and believe that. I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.

This is where this all takes a dark, dark, turn. Some people think God is a fairy tale. That is all fine and dandy. But there is a legitimate group of people. These 8,000 - 8,5000 people believe that Lucifer is God and that he is the true light. They Rebel against creation itself and attack, control, destroy it. 

A lot of them are luciferians. Some are Satanists. The thing is, this all boils down to Zionism. A long, long, deep rooted system of beliefs that has permeated mankinds existence even since the biblical times and has been documented in the Bible. The Israelites being casted away to Babylon. 

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

This brings me to my next horrid truth of reality. ""Satanic"" Sex Rings. The inspiration for this post comes from the repeated comments I see of people saying ""Satanic Sex Rings are Fake"" and ""Satanic Panic all over again""

There is a reason these tales exist in the first place. And I am going to provide proof to you that this world is run, and controlled, by these 8,000 - 8,500, and how they use Satanic Sex Rings, MKUltra Monarch Mind Control, to Split victims personalities. And how blackmail is collected on people wishing to get into power structures or into ""the top of the pyramid"" where access is only given to those that allow themselves to be taped having sex with kids. Or worse...  This is dark stuff, but it needs to be discussed. This is how these 8,000 - 8,500 psychopaths run the world, and also gives them protection from Good people trying to go after them because they ultimately control key positions of power and prevent investigations from going forth. This is why they hate awareness. This is why they hate Unity.

Divide and conquer is their favorite tool. Get your enemy distracted fighting themselves, and they are less of a threat to your own agenda.

Get mankind so hateful towards itself, towards the ""other"" persons skin color and sexual orientation of preference. They stand no chance to take you down when we are busy dividing ourselves.

This is their bread and butter. This is why we have share blue. Why we attract trolls and shills. This is why astroturfing exists. This is why you can follow the money and find out the truth. If you control the world, you control the money. If you control the money, you control the people. If you control the people, you control the world. You control media, you control Big Pharma, you control access to technology. You set up this big ploy of Russia vs United states then while the citizens of both countries are scared and fighting each other, the powers that were sit in the stands laughing and cheering as fellow man destroy themselves, completely oblivious to the spectators looking on and instigating us.

This game is rigged folks. This reality is controlled. The chains have moved from the physical to the spiritual.

This is the big conspiracy. This is where it all leads to.

Please. Watch these videos. Educate yourself. Bring awareness and light to this subject. Drop seeds of truth here and there with friends and family. Look for the truth and you will find it because the truth is within us. The moment you look outside yourself for the truth that is the moment you confirm you do not have the truth. Always truth your own intuition. Your own awareness and gut feelings. 

Let's come together as one, as we truly are. And free this world from the shackles that it has been placed in for thousands of years. I implore you, a fellow human, to please ponder these things and find a way to help in your own manner. We can stop this TODAY if we collectively chose to do so.

Anytime someone says pedophile rings do not exist, link them to this thread. Share these videos and links with them. Let them come to their conclusion and realize that this is indeed happening. Some will refuse. The more mankind awakens, the further some will create lies to continue their safe reality they have created for themselves. This is fine. We cannot push judgments or opinions as we all have our own way of viewing reality and if people wish to remain ignorant to the truth, that is their choice to do so.

We do not need to waste energy attacking each other anymore. Pushing opniions and trying to create a i am right you are wrong scenario only further divides us and builds ego and fills our heads. I have been guilty of it countless times and will be the first to admit that we all make mistakes and I have given in to emotions more times than I can count. It is time we take responsibility for our actions and realize the consequences of the choices we sometimes choose to make. Mistakes are bound to happen and we need to use them as a learning tool instead of a thing we need to avoid at all costs.

Here are some hard hitting links regarding these rings, as well as various personal testimony from woman that have survived sexual abuse torture and trafficking and other horrid cruel things. This needs awareness. These links do not all pertain to International Pedophile rings but shine light and give context where need be. Feel free to copy this whole post if you wish and share it. No need to give credit.

96,The Simpsons & The Yellow Cube,2123.0,g4m0x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4m0x9/the_simpsons_the_yellow_cube/,336.0,1587356172.0,"Back in 2006, Dr. Dan Burisch, a microbiologist, came out and claimed he once worked for Majestic 12, an alleged secret organization formed in 1947 by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Its purpose was to facilitate the recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. According to Dan, U.S. intelligence agencies were in possession of several devices that were capable of bending space-time, allowing one to look backward or forward in time[.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQqQoGbXsAIhh-f.jpg) They were supposedly a part of a top secret CIA program known as Project Looking Glass. Dan explained how one of the devices was built using instructions found in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian carvings as well as technology recovered from a crashed UFO. The ship was said to come from Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system somewhere in the Orion arm of the Milky Way.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12)

The Seti I Temple in Egypt is a very strange place. It has odd carvings Egyptologists can’t explain and some people think there’s actually a portal to another world somewhere inside it. The ancients believed the temple was built on the closest entry point between this world and the next. For this reason it was protected by a cosmic priesthood. They were known to possess knowledge of the cosmos and were here to aid in humanity’s ascension. Dorothy Eady, the caretaker of the temple in the late 1900s, was quite the character. She believed in a past life she had a been a priestess in the temple. The New York Times once called her one of the most intriguing and convincing modern cases of reincarnation. Dorothy also claimed she once fell into a dimensional hole while inside the temple where she could see the past. Were ancient Egyptians also able to see backward and forward in time? Is that what inspired these carvings?

[These are famously known as the helicopter hieroglyphs.](https://preview.redd.it/yt4ra8r60wt41.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f575a5ccc468fdd06912bfe1c678ff3e600a2cd2)

Another carving shows a Pharaoh dragging a weird sled-like vehicle with wings on it. Oddly enough, it kind of looks like the time travel device from the H.G. Wells movie The Time Machine.

[The carving is described as Ramesses running and towing behind him the sacred Henu-boat of the God Sokar.](https://preview.redd.it/3dslf8dm0wt41.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04a31da5dd5edc7c2deb5c430904df6ad8bfacb8)

According to Dan, this ancient Egyptian knowledge was used by the military to create the devices used in Project Looking Glass. One of them was described as being a small “magic box” you can hold in your hands. They called it the Yellow Cube. He says the Yellow Cube was used by world leaders to see what fate had in store for them. However, they discovered the future wasn’t set in stone. They were shown many different probabilities. They attempted to use this knowledge to manipulate our timeline. They could now see which future would be best for them and what needed to be done to get there. However, they also discovered a future where the whole world was nearly destroyed. They saw that it was caused by Looking Glass technology and immediately shut down the project. But it gets stranger. Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons, a show notorious for predicting the future, said the inspiration behind the fictional town of Springfield was a real place in Oregon. Groening grew up there, a couple hours away from a town called Lookingglass.

[https://time.com/4667462/simpsons-predictions-donald-trump-lady-gaga/](https://time.com/4667462/simpsons-predictions-donald-trump-lady-gaga/)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookingglass,\_Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookingglass,_Oregon)

Groening is rumored to be a high ranking Freemason. Perhaps at one point he was involved in Project Looking Glass. Is the Yellow Cube where all the predictions in the Simpsons came from? Are they using television to subconsciously suggest which future we manifest? The Simpsons is arguably the most watched show to ever exist. It’s one of the longest running series in history. To say the least, it’s been able to influence the psyche of your average American every night for the last 30 years. When things are this big you should be suspicious.

[Matt Groening all seeing eye symbolism.](https://preview.redd.it/xh9qwsd52wt41.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e40134e90bac9bdf15e9e6fda39e84c6b25f99d)

The Simpsons has made countless seemingly impossible predictions. In season 10 episode 2, The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace, Homer accurately predicts the mass of the Higgs Boson 14 years before scientists at CERN discovered it. How is this even possible?

[https://www.sciencealert.com/homer-simpson-predicted-the-mass-of-the-higgs-boson-14-years-before-cern](https://www.sciencealert.com/homer-simpson-predicted-the-mass-of-the-higgs-boson-14-years-before-cern)

The show also seems to be immune to the Mandela Effect. Did the elites do this on purpose? Perhaps they use the show like an interdimensional timestamp. They can tell when they’ve shifted timelines because the television show makes references to things in our original reality. Below is a video showing ten examples of The Simpsons ""wrongly"" remembering history.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEINDb8j1pQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEINDb8j1pQ)

But what I find most strange about all of this is the connection to CERN and the Higgs Boson. If you've read my last thread, you've already read my theory that the world ended in 2012. Like I said earlier, in the year 2012, CERN discovered the Higgs Boson, a particle Stephen Hawking warned could destroy the universe. Perhaps that did happen and we've been living in a parallel universe ever since. This would explain the Mandela Effect. Preston Nichols, another man with ties to Project Looking Glass, claimed that during time travel experiments at Fort Montauk, they were unable to find any tangible future after the year 2012.

Genesis P. Orridge used a familiar excuse (the same as James Alefantis) when they were chased out of UK in the 1980's. Said the charges are ridiculous because ""we have no basement"" in the Psychik TV house.

But, in fact, had a studio they called.... ""The Death Factory""

Your President sexually assaults young girls on camera. Numerous occasions, Joe Biden shows that he has no problem invading boundaries of children who he is a stranger to. He pinched a little girl's nipple on camera. It is bold. But not as bold as rubbing a little girl's hand on his crotch.

The mod team is honored to announce another in our continuing series of AMA (ask me anything) sessions on the subreddit.

For this round, our guest will be NSA Whistleblower William Binnney (verified via /u/WilliamBinney) and the AMA will take place on Thursday, August 27th, at Noon eastern time.

Mr. Binney was kind enough to provide photo verification for this AMA which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/F1IHym8).

This AMA is of particular interest as Mr. Binney's AMA earlier this week-on another subreddit-[was censored mid way through his scheduled time slot.](https://twitter.com/Burke4Senate/status/1298318463610560512?s=20)

For those unaware;

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA)[4] and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.

>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. 

>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).

>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

As to the issue of the 2016 DNC hack, Mr. Binney has the following to say in the text of [his initial (censored) AMA](https://archive.is/RMhh3);

>Remember when emails released by Wikileaks proved that the DNC rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders? And everyone claimed that the Russians had hacked the DNC?

>There's only one problem. There was no hack.

>It was an internal leak.

>Here's my proof

>It boils down to these three key points:

>1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

>2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

>3.)The NSA would've known the hack was taking place, thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied

>In October 2017, at the specific request of President Donald Trump, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at that time CIA Director, and presented my evidence that the ""Russian hack"" never was. Did Trump ever receive that evidence?

>So, Ask me anything!

(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2 will help you clarify who is who.)


King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  


Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

He says he “knows things” and is going public & that CP was placed on his laptop by his ex-GF, who he says is a spy.

3 days later Coindesk (a respected crypto media site) publishes leaked financials for the largest crypto fund - based out of - you guessed it, the Bahamas. This is where it gets interesting. That fund is Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The very same SBF who has been a staunch proponent of crypto regulations, the same type of regulations that would stifle on-chain exchanges and ‘DeFi’ and allow his firm FTX to corner the market. The same type of DeFi that Nikolai’s project was a trailblazer in.

FTX/Alameda proceed to say all is good, nothing to see, this is FUD. They joust with well know Binanace founder CZ, and assure customers all is well and the balances are not fcked. The balances are indeed fcked and FTX melts down in spectacular fashion, taking numerous portfolio companies with them. The anon digging begins.

Quickly it is discovered that SBF and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, have solid connections to the SEC (through Caroline’s dad who worked directly with SEC chair GG at MIT) and high level connections to the current Biden administration through SBF (2nd largest Biden donor) and SBFs mother (a Stanford professor with a large dem super PAC). Timing of SBFs rise to fame is also called into question as FTX launched days after Biden announced his presidential campaign, giving SBF the new wealth to become the 2nd largest donor to Biden.

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty” - Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/watch-how-the-cia-helped-make-zero-dark-thirty/ (http://archive.is/zIRh0)

- Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

It’s 50,000 years old, and 650 meters deep in the water. That doesn’t necessarily have to do with the headline, but it’s just to get gears turning in your head about the potential amounts of undiscovered humanity we’re currently sitting on, that no scientific community is willing to touch, that no organization is willing to fund.

If you believe in secret societies possessing any real hidden knowledge, that certain bloodlines like the Rockefeller’s have kept bloodlines pure for generations, that there is any merit to the Sumerian King List, The Book of Enoch, then this question is important. 

Whether you believe in ancient pagan gods, aliens, Judaism, Christianity, etc. there are references to this early world. It’s in Genesis. It’s in cuneiform tablets. What if the flood wasn’t a flood in how we traditionally understand it, but a cataclysmic shift occurred in an extreme short period of time and suddenly massive parts of the earth that didn’t used to be covered by ocean waters, suddenly were. Makes sense you realize we haven’t discovered or explored even 2% of the ocean’s surface. 

But the writings themselves due it justice more than wild theories. And even if you don’t want to turn to traditional religious sources, even just for entertaining the possibility, read *The Terra Papers* or even *The 12th Planet* . Look up the CIA’s involvement with Remote viewing. I personally don’t have all the answers and I wouldn’t trust anyone who claimed they did but I believe there’s an absolute shit ton of merit to these stories, scrolls, tablets, pyramids, structures, and General ET activity even in present day that all point to us not being alone. Scientists still don’t understand how we took a planet with no life whatsoever, and a single piece of bacteria or virus somehow sprang forth a single called organism and suddenly humans with consciousness exist, while every living organism lacks it. 

What’s your thoughts on this all. Am I crazy or do some of you guys believe there is a reason scientists are reluctant to look further into this all, other than their own egos not willing to accept their whole lives PhD work would be debunked in their field?",conspiracy,CIA

You can disagree with someone and call them a retard and not get banned. However, people come here to learn about current events and learn about conspiracy theories, and we are being hijacked in this election season (again).

Some kind user in another conspiracy sub showed me the Bot Sentinel plugin. I was surprised to see how rampant bots were, and I realized that a lot of times I was getting angry at bots, then taking it out on real people.

There's a lot of warfare here about left vs right. I would advise people to understand that different things motivate us and we see things differently, but what unites us is our desire for freedom and to fight back against the power of the so-called elite. It is quite sickening that at a time when so many people are waking up to crimes like child trafficking, we are faced with a choice between two old men both accused of being pedos. Epstein is dead (maybe) and Ghislaine is facing trial, but why aren't we hearing daily updates about what the FBI is doing to root out their network, the way we heard Ken Starr talk about cum on a blue dress and secret meetings with the Russians in Trump Tower.

I really feel a change is coming, and I think this community can be a major part of that change. Whatever you think of Coronavirus, it is doing one incredibly good thing...it is blowing the cover clean off the workings of of the elite. Our society has been brainwashed to worship billionaires and we're told that we should trust half of our money with them, but where are they now? They are useless. They only use their money to preserve their positions of power.

But the jig is up. Half the country just isn't going into work and the country is surviving. The ""reality"" we were forced to buy into by the ruling elite, media, politicians, etc is all falling apart. They're even losing control of the stock market. They pumped $1.5 TRILLION into the market, but a surprise happened. A bunch of regular people on RobinHood jumping in and scored some of that cash. Now, the elite are expecting the market to crash again so they can extend their gains, but it isn't happening on their schedule. We know the stock market means nothing about the economy. It is just a rich person's casino, and the RH users flooding the market are fucking up the computer algorithms that companies spend millions to write.

The reason I'm posting this here is that this sub has become a thought leader. We're no longer obscure tin foil hatters, but conspiracies are now mainstream. People will continue to flood this sub, and what is posted here gets echoed around the internet.

As a group, we don't agree on much, and that's fine. But I think it's safe to say that we all agree you can't trust the elite. Any of them. They wouldn't be allowed into the club if they weren't willing to play by the rules.

We are at a point where we can take down the elite parasites. We can destroy the corrupt Hollywood culture that harbors and promotes sexualization of children and just plain decadent excess. We can lead the movement to rid the world of billionaires who make their money through modern day slavery, corrupt government deals, working as fronts for spy agencies, then buy off politicians to make our lives worse so even affording a doctor's visit is a luxury today. We can fight corporations who fund CIA-developed propaganda campaigns in the form of ""marketing"" and mass media.

So, in closing, I just wanted to give a little pep talk to the sub to understand the potential we have here, and hopefully we can take advantage of this opportunity and bring secrecy and corruption to light. Even if we disagree, we are united in our desire to make the world a better place, free from evil, corruption, suppression and slavery.",conspiracy,CIA

Did anything actually even change for any of us?

I suppose you could say that maybe you got some breadcrumbs. Maybe some of you got a tax break? Saved up a few extra dollars? But many of us had our small businesses go under during the pandemic.

When it comes to the important stuff, and promises that were made by Trump, like exposing the global crime syndicate, investigating and auditing the central banks, restoring our civil liberties taken from us from the NDAA and the patriot act, ending the wars abroad, and dismantling unnecessary and intrusive big government agencies, nothing changed and nothing was even done.

Why would people take to the streets to defend an administration that didn’t do a fucking thing for us? Why are we still holding onto the idea that this administration was any different, and that he is not just another NWO puppet? because of some tacky political theatre that is making you all emotionally invested in the political soap opera and taking things at face value?

If we *really* want to change things, we have to acknowledge the truth, that this administration was no different than the last, and the next one will be the same, **because they all serve the same criminal enterprise.** Trump was just another puppet for the New World Order. 

This is an unsettling revelation, but it's something we have to accept if we want to incite change.

I’m only doing this because I care about humanity, my future, my children’s future, oppressed people around the globe, and really the survival of our species in a time when more money and resources is dedicated to weaponry and AI/Tech than ever before.

The first rule you need to know is conspiracy theorist was a weaponized term by the CIA to make people fall in line, and ridicule anyone who opposed the status quo narrative. Politicians LOVE this term, because it enables their goals while simultaneously encouraging you to mock anyone who speaks out.

The second rule is everything you have heard regarding conspiracies, while it contains falsehoods, is relatively true in one way or another. This is just a Reddit post intended to point you in the right direction so I won’t make a super in depth post but I encourage all to do their due diligence and research these subjects, as I’ve learned it’s the only way the majority will reach *the truth* anyways. 

Freemasonry, CIA, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, United Nations, Vatican, FBI, NSA, Mossad, M16, Federal Reserve, CCP, etc.

Learn right now that there are people in this world so powerful they influence everything you see and hear on a daily basis. The hardest part to accepting this all, is like The Matrix Movie on a tiny scale. Everything is fake, manufactured, planned, and coordinated. 


“Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” Attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812).

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions) 

Bush = evil. Clinton = evil. Obama = evil. Older Bush = evil.   HERES the difference.. Trump = somewhat disrespectful idiot who is not a career politician or ties to public office (senate/house/president/VP) but actually likes America and opposes the Globalist agenda. 

Twitter is compromised. Reddit is compromised. Facebook is compromised. Even this sub = compromised. Operation Mockingbird is in full effect every day in here to sway public opinion. ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people. 

“I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.” - Harry S Truman, President of the United States.

Love yourself. Love your neighbor. Love and peace is the only thing that can conquer all. Educate yourself. Educate others. Understand atheism is a carefully crafted lie to make you believe this is all there is to life. Understand we have a purpose. There is more than meets the eye in this materialistic and corporatist society we currently inhabit, and all truths will eventually rise to the surface. Don’t lose faith.

Edit: to understand how this sub is compromised, look at almost every top comment. It’s not discussing the material, or the main parts of what’s being implied here, but rather every comment is nitpicking anything I said about Trump, and only Trump. In my original post, I claim Trump is a bad person. An imbecile. Can’t say a speech to save his life. Disrespectful. Just a non intelligent human being. Nor does he do honorable things like release tax returns or present real forward thinking ideas or policies. I end it with acknowledging *no matter what candidate takes office the next 4 years will be hell.* However, the shill crowd immediately comes in and glosses over the MAIN parts of what I’m saying here, which is conspiracy theories related to government and politics are for the most part true, to research agencies and institutions that contribute to the stripping of your rights in modern day propaganda in broad daylight, especially the CIA.",conspiracy,CIA
128,"Our entire Solar System is changing rapidly, but nobody is talking about it",1720.0,zi9kxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/zi9kxm/our_entire_solar_system_is_changing_rapidly_but/,703.0,1670721365.0,"All the major bodies of our Solar System are changing rapidly, but nobody is talking about it.  We are seeing rapid observable changes to almost every single planet:

1. Pluto's atmosphere has recently collapsed
2. Neptune's storms have suddenly begun rotating backwards
3. Uranus' polar regions are visibly flaring
4. Jupiter has recently experienced a 700 degree temperature impulse originating from its northern pole, and its great red spot is fading
5. Mars is suddenly displaying seismic activity
6. Our own polar regions have warmed drastically recently, the amount of volcanic activity we are seeing is at an all-time high
7. Venus's planetary winds have increased their velocity by 33% in the last 20 years

It goes on from there, we've recently observed:

1. large-scale changes in the ice cover on Jupiter’s moon Europa
2. large-scale changes in the polar ice cap on Mars
3. a large-scale decrease in atmospheric pressure on Venus
4. a mysterious brightening of the atmosphere of Saturn
5. a mysterious darkening of the atmosphere of Venus
6. unusual changes in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere of Neptune
7. a brightening of the atmosphere of Jupiter
8. a mysterious dark spot near the South Pole of Venus

Here on earth, our own magnetosphere is rapidly losing it's strength as our magnetic poles continue to race away from their usual positions, wreaking havoc on animal migrations - see all the beached whales this year as well as the spike in reports of unusual bird sightings.

Things have gotten to the point where we are now updating our magnetic models yearly, and soon there will be zones of flux broken bad enough to cause real danger to flying due to constant magnetic reconnection.

Our aurorae are reaching levels of intensity not normally seen, with recent  high-energy'pink' aurorae being observed.

The fundamental electromagnetic nature of this planet - electromagnetism responsible for a variety of effects on life, most especially cardiac and pulmonary health in humans humans, is changing rapidly.

Volcanic activity on our planet is currently at a record, with more and more volcanoes showing concerning lift, erupting, or showing increases in lava flow. Every single active volcano along the pacific rim is showing increased activity. Mount Rainier looks ready soon. The Sisters in Oregon are showing lift - and then there's volcano mama herself, Yellowstone, showing signs of increasing rumbling.

Given only one of two data points, it woulud be easy to discount the events as isolated and unrelated outliers with no significance.

Taken together, however, the total body of evidence becomes impossible to ignore, and, once the presumption is made that this information is known by our leaders, pretty much explains the motivations for their actions.

Everything is changing. Nobody is telling you. In fact, they built us a world where these questions are taboo, where every answer leads you away from the glaring, obvious truth.

“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”   William Casey, former director of the CIA, upon being asked what the goal of the agency was (in 1981).

These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.

Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.

The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.

The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.

The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.

NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.

The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.

Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.

If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.

I have a theory about his recent divorce. As many of you may know, the economy will be having a major correction soon. Stocks could easily go down 50% or more. Bezos, being close with the CIA and the richest man in the world, probably knows this. He knows that he will lose tens of billions of dollars. So what does he want to do? Sell as much Amazon stock as possible. Because his entire net worth is in Amazon stock. But imagine if Bezos suddenly started offloading billions in Amazon shares? The stock price would crash. The entire market could crash from something that big. He could also get charged with securities fraud if he sells because he knows something will go down soon.

So what is old Jeff to do?

Follow the lead of the only executive to get away scot free after Enron collapsed. When Enron was about to collapse, all the executives sold millions of dollars of their shares. They ended up getting charged for this fraud. Except for one man. He just so happened to divorce his wife for some random stripper. Right before the collapse. A judge ordered him to sell his shares and split the proceeds with his now ex wife. So he was able to get away will it all.

My theory is that Bezos know that the stock market will soon collapse. He wants to have a way to sell off his shares without getting in trouble or alerting the public that something is wrong. So he orchestrates some high profile affair and his wife leaving him. He makes sure there is a ton of drama to keep it in the news. Then during the divorce proceedings, he is ""ordered"" to sell his stock. So nobody thinks twice.

It turns out that the person who leaked the affair story to the press was none other than the brother of the mistress. He also just happened to come out an publicly say that Bezos and his wife are't telling the truth about the divorce and that they have other reasons.

&#x200B;

So keep an eye out on this. When he starts to offload his Amazon shares, you know the collapse is imminent.

>U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors 

>The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.

>""Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there.""

>And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? ""Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.

They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see.

>“The only thing Hollywood likes more than a good movie is a good deal,” David Robb explains, and that’s why the producers of films like “Top Gun,” “Stripes” and “The Great Santini” have altered their scripts to accommodate Pentagon requests. In exchange, they get inexpensive access to the military locations, vehicles, troops and gear they need to make their movies. 

>As one of the technical advisors, Maj. David Georgi of the Army, said to me, “If they don’t do what I say, I take my toys and go away.”

>The first thing you have to do is send in a request for assistance, telling them what you want pretty specifically — ships, tanks, planes, bases, forts, submarines, troops — and when you want this material available. Then you have to send five copies of the script to the Pentagon, and they give it to the affected service branches — Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard. Then you wait and see if they like your script or not. If they like it, they’ll help you; if they don’t, they won’t. Almost always, they’ll make you make changes to the military depictions. And you have to make the changes that they ask for, or negotiate some kind of compromise, or you don’t get the stuff.

>....Of course, an ‘R’ rating means children under 17 have to be accompanied by a parent, so a lot of 16- and 17-year-olds couldn’t see this picture. And the Air Force wanted young people to see this so they’d get a good, positive image of the military and join up. So they changed it.

Iran is a complex country, as I’m sure most countries are. There is this great video I recommend you all to watch it from this Amazing American dude who travels all around the world! Give it a chance!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWNXneUrMY&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWNXneUrMY&t=1s)

I can go into how we were happily living under a secular democratic system for a short period of time after centuries of having a Kingdom and a dictator to rule us. I always wonder what could we achieve if we didn’t have oil, or if Musaddegh wasn’t as honorable as he was and would have become a friend to the west, negotiating on a deal that would have worked for both sides, even more for the US. I have pride but I would have wanted a good relation with the west even if that meant selling out our assets/resources to a foreign country for cheaper because the alternative has been misery for the majority of Iranians, especially in the last 15 years.

What I know is that we had a secular system, with laws based on humanity and ethics not some guy's book from 1400 years ago who wasn’t even a Persian. Musaddegh didn’t sell out, he was toppled and Shah was installed. Shah did great things economically which in itself is a whole story but there were still many people living in poverty who didn’t like Shah living lavishly like a KING when they could barely afford a roof over their head.

He also oppressed religious minorities to some extent, banned headscarf and persecuted activists. Anyhow he fucked up and people believed and fell for right wing promise of a religious (and secular at the same time!) Mulla revolution that will bring oil money to everyone’s table, people, not only the ones in charge!

People believed in him, Khomeini, and it turned out his promise was a lie. The opposite happened. No one except the people in charge has seen any of that oil money in the past 4 decades

I come from a small town where all schools, hospital, roads, pipeline, and basically every bit of infrastructure are built by donations from a few wealthy and generous people we have.

Some facts that are barely discussed in English speaking forums. Like how 80-90% of people working for the regime and more important politicians have dual nationalities along with their spouses and kids. MANY from the US and Europe.

Ali Larijani who is the speaker of the Parliment, very anti American(politics)and also happens to  be the Leader Khamenei’s son in Law, has a daughter who lives in Ohio and has finished her medical school there. So you see in the case of a war, almost none of them are gonna get hurt. Their families will be out of Iran in matter of days.

On the recent news and incident.

I have not seen many people in the west describing the situation in Iran correctly. Why? Well one because they are right to not believe the MSM and government’s narrative but none are talking to actual Iranians directly, neither pro Trump nor anti war people in the west.

Don't take me and my stats for my word. What I have said or am saying could be asked from any Iranian. You can find hundreds of us on social media and more than a few know how to communicate basic messages in English. Just talk to them. I would suggest visiting our country to get the truth but at this time I don’t recommend it at all. Unless you are an activist. But it is still risky because you can’t really report the whole truth from there. The government would only allow half of it ( the part people being angry at the west, not the entire reality and the majority being angry at the government)

Pro government people are mourning his death and anti government people (the majority) are not. I can't say what percentages of Iranians are unhappy with the government but I know for a fact that we are in the majority, well over 70% if you ask me. Among the younger generation, which are the majority of Iranians that number is well above 90%.

If these numbers seem irrational and unrealistic, look up and read the US's congress and Senate's approval rating. It isn't any better.

The anti government portion is more worry of the possibility of a war because they don't wanna die for a system they despise while pro government people are expecting demand a retaliation.

98% of people in the west are looking at this as it is a black or white situation while this couldn't be any grayer.

Soleimani was fighting isis in Iraq (in itself a good thing ) in a war that again, the majority of Iranians don't support. Iran’s alliance in Syria is of a diplomatic nature not based on humanity or saving people from isis or whatever.

Soleimani was also the guy in charge of repressing anti government protest in Iran for decades, including 2008 uprising over a rigged election ( it was actually funny how rigged it was but they still got away with it). Thousands of protesters were gunned down under his command. The protests about three months ago over gas prices hiking up also resulted in over 500 deaths. The sad part is both the left, right nor independent channels I watch and follow really reported on this topic.

If a war breaks out, the true victims of this situation are without a doubt the majority of Iranians, getting screwed by both the Iranian regime and US government, just as we are now.

The sanctions don’t hurt the rich or the government. It hurts the middle class and poor which consist the majority of Iranians.

Living expense has increased 3, 4 folds, while wages have doubled at max. Property value/rent has risen almost anywhere from 5-10 times, in response to our currency tanking over sanctions. The poor has become extremely poor and the middle class has become poor while the wealthy which owns property and materials like cars have become millionaires and the multi millionaires even wealthier!

The cheapest (one of the shittiest available) car made in Iran, Kia Pride, (a newer version an old Kia Pride model) goes for 70 M toman brand new. The same car was 6 million a decade ago. I remember it being 6 million since I was a kid and …. That’s where we are after 10 years of sanctions.

Ok I will end this rant now

Neither pro war nor anti war people in the US are right on their report of the situation.

pro war people:

Soleimani is bad (true but not for the reason they say. Edit: This is what I mean. I don't believe he was going to harm Any American or as they say was involved in ""an imminent threat."" I think Neocons wanted a provocation with Iran for a long time and ... .

 I've read the majority of American death attributed to him are from Iraq war time, 10 years ago. I believe he was capable of doing a lot of bad shit, or has done in the past and wish him and all criminals like him could face a judge and jury!  I just don't buy into what Pompeo and Trump say like I never liked Obama and Biden/Hillary.

This video is also very telling.

 I remember watching this live like it was yesterday.

""I don't like Assad at all but Assad is killing isis. Russia is killing isis and Iran is killing isis!"" Trump 2016""

@ 1:25

And now suddenly Pompeo and Trump say he was the baddest guy in the world? Why didn't they go after him in 2009,10... Every crime he is accused of comitting, Killing protesters in Iran and Americans in Iraq dates back to 2000s. 

&#x200B;

Iran government bad (true, but is US government doing anyone any good?)

95% want government gone: not really that high. Unfortunately US's response and actions has given government more support no matter how much they suck. Trump killing Soleimani this way pushes people who are in the middle to the government’s side. So will a war. Saddam’s invasion with West’s “go ahead and blessing” only made the recently won revolution more popular, so will a war waged against a despised regime and forcing people to fight for a system that has oppressed them all their life, taking away the basic freedom and choices a human deserves.

I’d like to believe the regime doesn’t have more than 20% supports but I don’t have a number on that. It is hard to conduct independent surveys with the limited freedoms of speech and press we have. if you live among Iranians, it won’t take you more than a week to realize the majority want a total reform.

\-90% would love us to bomb them!(false). Like I said, the Iranian civilians will pay the highest cost for that war. Looking at our neighbors, they don’t seem to be better off than they were before US’s invasion.

Anti war people:

\-Soleimani was good (false. Fighting isis doesn't make him a good guy! He wasn't fighting them to defend his people, for a good cause even though he believed that. Iran’s fight against ISIS has nothing to do with what the majority of Iranians wanted).

\-Iran government good: (false) Not all of them are pushing this narrative. Secular talk and Kim Iverson on youtube have both correctly reported that Iranians are very unhappy with their government. Yet 95% of the left, anti war voices on the right and independents who are calling out Trump on this ignore this part. I know why they are doing it though. One you agree with the CIA’s talking point that X is a bad guy, then they say “well we have to do something about it don’t we?” and many people with good intentions would think that’s the right thing to do! Manufacturing consent I suppose it is called. Or maybe I’m wrong. But in this case, the bad guy is really bad! I’m upset they don’t say it but what I care more is me, my relatives and my compatriots not getting bombed. So I’m thankful to every anti war voice on the left, right and independent, even if they are reporting what goes on inside Iran not accurately.

\-The majority don't want a war (true!) I don’t think this needs an explanation.

I'm personally not saddened even for a bit over Soleimani’s death news, but the possibility of a war has made me quit worry. I’ve always been afraid of war. Not dying in it but surviving it while many of the people I know and care for don't.

My numbers are my opinions and what I perceive. I encourage everyone to their own research on the things they can find online and talk to Iranians, the one who live in Iran, if you want to know how they feel about this situation! You will find many people angry at the government who would love anything, including a war, as oppose to the current situation but the majority don't want a war.

I’d like to leave it with a positive note which is a fact. Americans are probably the most liked  nationality for Iranians. Again I encourage all you to watch Peter’s video on Iran. Take his word for it not mine

For me personally, the most welcoming and warm people I have met in my life have been Americans and I have lived a few countries.

This war isn’t between us, the people, but sadly it is us who have to fight the wars.

Forgive my grammar, spelling and poor writing skills.

If you really  did read all of it, you really do give a shit. Thanks!

There were articles on EVERY major news platform about his arrest minutes after it happened, as if  articles were prepared and deals were already made to publicise them everywhere.

The inverted triangle is very suspicious. It's one thing to do the mudra when you are getting interviewed to be like ""all my energy connects when they are together"" but that sign when you're getting arrested is a public statement.

He tells people NOT to buy houses. This fits the WEF agenda of ""own nothing, be happy"". Assets moon during hyper inflation, those holding cash are the ones that lose.

He claims to be against the Matrix, but the main thing he talks about is chasing materialism to gain happiness, which is what fuels the Matrix.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, all 'heros' are compromised and you should just get the best out of them and not be too attached. In the dictatorship we live in, people need a type of hero to believe in to give them some sense of hope or winning, in order to keep them complacent. Tates message was to show us what happens if you speak out, this will prevent anyone from standing up out of fear of getting canceled, going to jail, getting your bank account frozen, etc. Even if Tate is protected, he still woke many people up and is a net positive to society.

Most conspiracy theories have a true part and a false part from taking the original concepts too far beyond what's reasonable. The ""Taking it too far"" part is often pushed as disinfo, to distract people from the true part, and it has seriously muddied the waters of conversation in places where controversial topics are discussed.  

True: The government has technology that is about 20-30 years ahead of what we have, and they hide it and use it to give themselves more power over others. 

Taking it too far: They have secret zero-point infinite-energy technology. They have for thousands of years. They can communicate with aliens through a hyper-dimensional internet. They can communicate with the past/future and are far more powerful than you can imagine.  

True: Bush allowed 9/11 to happen, he was briefed on it repeatedly and ignore the briefings. The CIA and Mossad had a relationship with the Saudis to foment terrorism so they can continue to get funding and advance their geopolitical goals by stoking fears in the public. The pentagon was hit in the exact part that contained the documents documenting the missing Trillions of dollars the pentagon had announced the day before. Building 7 was demolished, and was not hit by a plane, and also contained many floors owned by the DoD.  

Taking it too far: The planes were not real and were holographic. The buildings were exploded by mini-nukes. Bush personally hired people to do 9/11 and organized it himself. The Jews did 9/11. No one died on 9/11. No one was in the planes. 

True: Chemical trails are sprayed from some airplanes in order to influence the weather. Insurance companies will pay money for cloud seeding to make sure they don't have to payout on farmland they insure going through drought. China used it before their olympics, and weather modification is banned as a weapon of war since the 70s. 

Taking it too far: Every single commercial plane is spraying chemicals in to the air. Every single pilot and maintenance worker is covering this up. 

True: Things aren't as they seem and we are regularly lied to by the very people who are supposed to inform us. 

Taking it too far: Everything I learned is wrong, therefore the world is literally flat. 

True: Some people have reactions to certain vaccines or vaccine schedules, and the government has awarded a quarter of a billion dollars in compensation in vaccine damages over the last 25 years. 

Taking it too far: Vaccines are designed to make us all sick, and are a secret plot by the medical industry to make everyone sick or disabled so they need medical care, which is profitable for the medical industry. 

True: There is fluoride in our drinking water, and studies show it does not help teeth at all. Before we put it in our water, it was an unprofitable waste product of aluminum mining and the original advocate of fluoride in water owned an aluminum mine. It is now a profit center. 

Taking it too far: We are being intentionally poisoned using mind-controlling chemicals to keep us docile. People with calcified pineal glands are spiritual zombies. 

True: There is probably alien life out there somewhere. 

Taking it too far: The aliens come to earth all the time, and run all our governments. Most youtube videos about UFOs are real. Lizard people walk on earth. Disclosure is coming any day. Project Bluebeam will probably happen. 

True: The Rothschilds originated the current banking system design and play a large part in running the central banks of the west. As do the Morgans, Rockefellers, and others. The central banking system is predatory and used to control governments.

Taking it too far: One cabal runs the whole world and everything in it. Everything is perfectly controlled. This world is a hologram simulation matrix. Nothing is real, this is just a video game or a dream. 

True: Moneyed globalists are pushing through corporations to take control of the US government, through both parties.

Taking it too far: Leftists are commies and the US is going to become communist Hitler Germany if we let liberalism win. Rightists are hidden neo-nazis who are all racists and want to control those who don't look like them through fascism, so if we let the right win the US will become fascist Hitler Germany. 

True: Our mainstream society, thanks to the media and schooling system, is relatively abusive and power-seeking. 

Taking it too far: _Every single person_ in this society is abusive and power seeking. People are not to be trusted and you must go it alone. 

It's so easy to believe the true, and then someone will come along and try and twist it and take it that extra illogical step that invalidates the whole thing. Got any more examples? ",conspiracy,CIA

>One consultant, Jonathan Winer, told ABC: “it’s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading covering the entire world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.”[1] The list of affected nations was long, and included the US, Germany, Japan, France Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the UK, Switzerland and Spain.[2] Soon, independent investigations were underway on three continents in the belief that the paper trail would lead to the terrorists.
 
>Press statements by leading figures in the international banking community left little doubt that the evidence was compelling. Ernst Welteke, President of the German Deutsche Bundesbank, told reporters that “a preliminary review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in airlines and insurance companies, along with major trades in gold and oil markets, before September 11 that suggest….advance knowledge of the attacks. Welteke said that his researchers came across….almost irrefutable proof of insider trading.”  Welteke was blunt: “What we found makes us sure that people connected to the terrorists must have been trying to profit from this tragedy.”[3]

So the insider trading was very obvious in the early days after the attack. Everyone seemed gung-ho to track down these traders as it would lead directly to the terrorists.

>""The suspicion is that inside information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amid all the chaos the criminals would have, at the very least, a good head start,"" said Convar director Peter Henschel. 


They were even able to recover hundreds of harddrives from the rubble and were able to recover almost all of the data held on them.


>""It could turn out that Americans went on an absolute shopping binge on that Tuesday morning. But at this point there are many transactions that cannot be accounted for,'' Henschel said.""

>""There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes in order to move out amounts exceeding $100 million,'' Wagner said. ""They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed.'' 


After some time all mention of this investigation seemed to disappear and people started wondering what the SEC had found.

>In his book “Crossing the Rubicon”, former LAPD detective Mike Ruppert explains the SEC’s unprecedented move to deputize:
 
>What happens when you deputize someone in a national security or criminal investigation is that you make it illegal for them to disclose publicly what they know…. In effect, they become government agents and are controlled by government regulations rather than their own conscience. In fact, they can be thrown in jail without a hearing if they talk publicly. I have seen this implied threat time and again with federal investigations, intelligence agents, and even members of the United States Congress who are bound so tightly by secrecy oaths and agreements that they are not even able to disclose criminal activities inside the government for fear of incarceration.[13]
 
>Notice, this surely means that Al Qaeda had nothing to do with the insider trading.[14] When the evidentiary trail led back to Wall Street, the SEC moved quickly to control the evidence and muzzle potential witnesses. Despite the best efforts of the SEC, a few details did leak to the world press. In mid-October 2001, The Independent (UK) reported that, “To the embarrassment of investigators, it has….emerged that the firm used to buy many of the ‘put’ options (where a trader, in effect, bets on a share price fall) on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by Alvin ‘Buzzy’ Krongard, now executive director of the CIA.”[15]

Well it turns out that when the SEC found direct connections between the firms involved in the trading and the CIA they moved to make everything secret.

Why is the military purposely flying squads of airplane at night in formations that can easily be mistaken as gigantic UFOs? 


Why you ask?


Because they need to come up with an explanation for trillions of missing dollars.   



Let’s think rationally for a moment.  The UFO phenomenon has been filmed since the 1940’s when Foo Fighters were first spotted. http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html  Over the decades there have been countless testimonies and sightings by credible sources (like military/commercial pilots) let alone hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage.  Ask anyone in the world if they know what a UFO is and they will answer yes.  Are we to believe that the strongest, the most advanced military in the world does not know everything there is to know about UFOs in 2010’s?  Are we to believe that the research into the topic only began on 2007 as according to the NYT?  Absurd!  How naïve do you have to be to believe such utter non-sense?


Enter the threat of the first-ever audit of the Pentagon and the DoD. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli   As the saying goes, they’re up the creek without a paddle.  Yes, they are missing AT LEAST $21 trillion by some estimates and as much as $29 trillion by more “sensationalistic” media outlets. http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/


Where did all this money go?  Well, I’d imagine some went to legit above top secret weapons research.  Now, most of these experiments probably failed, wasting trillions.  The military has every motivation to hide failed experiments while publicizing the crap out of successful ones.  Why?  Because repeated reports of failures will drive the public and Congress to doubt about funding future projects.  So they hide the unsuccessful results as much as possible.   They simply don’t want their revenue stream reduced.


Next?  Probably a significant amount went in to illegal operations and sensitive surveillance.  After all, you can’t actually put into accounting ledgers that we were spying on our closest allies or that we were responsible for certain insurrections in the Middle East, or that we’re actually protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan, right?   Or that we’re even spending vast resources monitoring our own population unconstitutionally.  No, no, all those things have to be off-the-books.


Finally, I suspect that large sums of money were embezzled or diverted to enrich the Military Industrial Complex.  All those extravagant perks don’t come cheap you know.  Who cares if the military pays $200k for an LCD monitor that costs $50 to make.  It’s all free money.  Well, to them that is, because it’s our money.


So, what to do?  How are the Pentagon and the DoD going to account for over $20 trillion in missing funds?  Well, you figure they’ll point to covert programs and secret development for up to $10 trillion or so.  But there’s just no way they’re going to come up with an acceptable explanation for all $20+ trillion.


That’s where the UFO patsy comes in.  Yes.  They are going to reveal that trillions that were actually squandered (or outright stolen) were justifiably spent on the following:
1.	To research and validate the existence of UFOs.
2.	To devise and construct early warning systems (such as a satellite network) that can detect UFOs encroaching on our space.
3.	To come up with feasible ways to defend ourselves against an unlikely but possible alien invasion.
4.	Labs and research centers dedicated to understanding how the UFOs function should they turn out to be real.
5.	Etc. etc. bla bla bla…


You see where they’re going with this?  When the entire planet is at stake, $10+ trillion in defense suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.   Of course, no evidence of actual development or proof of systems will ever be disclosed.  You know, national security and all.  But all this hinges on the majority of the population believing that UFO are real and that a credible threat is a possibility.  This is why more and more information will be released from the Pentagon in the coming months.  They want you to believe!


If you need proof of my argument, just look at the NY Times article.  
> In the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find.

The very first line of the article specifically states the amount spent on this program.  Why does it make such an emphasis in this insignificant amount of $22 million?  Simple.  They are trying to program us in to accepting that it is normal to spend money on UFO research.  Need more proof?  Look further down the article.
> “Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Do you see the psychological manipulation?  Do you see how the article is trying to make us believe that funding for UFO research is not only justified but absolutely necessary?


Don’t fall for this crap.  While I’m a firm believer in UFOs, I also know damn well that the DoD, CIA, NSA and just about every powerful agency in the country knows the full truth of UFOs.  They’ve known for decades!  They’re just trying to convince you that all that money that’s missing?  Well, that it was well spent.  They’re gonna claim they’re saving your ass from greys and reptilians so just be thankful.


In the coming months (and even years), the government will release more and more info on UFOs.  Do not fall for it.  It’s old news.  It’s stuff the govt has known for a long time, carefully packaged to make you think… “hmm, maybe we DO need to spend more money on UFO research and defense.”  It’s all a ruse.  It’s all a scam.  They’re just trying to cover their ass for the missing $29 trillion.  

This is the real “Project Blue Beam”.  It is to obfuscate and justify the trillions that have been illegally used by our own military.  


P.S.  Upon re-reading my post, I seem to be saying that UFOs definitely exists and the govt has been hiding it.  I am not.  I am saying the govt fully knows for sure whether they exist or not.  I do not know what they know.  All I'm saying is that they are using psyop to get people to question ""MAYBE UFOs exists"".   When enough people start questioning the existence of UFOs, their secret unaccounted $10+ trillion spent on supposed projects to verify UFOs will seem justified.  It will all be BS because they already know whether they exist or not and have known for decades.

[Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?](https://spectator.org/the-invisible-awan-brothers-scandal/)

[Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers?

I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. 

Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm). Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511) and knew [Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch) and through [three degrees of separation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/) used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/). If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.






• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?

• The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. 

• The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. 





### The Media
Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.

>With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ) you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath.

Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569).

>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.

This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/transformers/).

This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes...

>The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet.  Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood “[fifth column” has “infiltrated U.S. Government](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/30/capt-joseph-john-muslim-brotherhood-fifth-column-infiltrated-u-s-government/),” and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration.



 The media is [90% Democrat](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/) and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist.

>[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html) is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.

>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.

>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.

>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.

Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/). Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers.

>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.


After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers.

>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.



The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/). House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. 

This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. 

Let's state that again...

###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data.

We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.""





###The Bad Guy


###Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach


The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data.

[House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586)

>Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge.

>More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.


>The former staffer said “Jamal was always there,” but Imran would only work “odd hours.”

And who is investigating this fiasco?

>Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? 


D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the [Congressional members](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586) involved with the Awan Brothers. 

>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.

>""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.

Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. 

The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/) to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. 



>    Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.

>Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/).

Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.

[Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1)
>[frontpagemag](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield) |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.

>The [signatories to the letter](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf) were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.


Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418) and [Huma Abedin](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556) are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?

>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.

>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.




with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. 





















What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. 

While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. 

I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away.


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

A Famous saying is HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF... 

In 1933, the ultimate extremist group, led by Adolf Hitler, seized power and used the records to identify, disarm, and attack political opponents and Jews. Constitutional rights were suspended, and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued. Police revoked gun licenses of Social Democrats and others who were not “politically reliable.”

During the five years of repression that followed, society was “cleansed” by the National Socialist regime. Undesirables were placed in camps where labor made them “free,” and normal rights of citizenship were taken from Jews. The Gestapo banned independent gun clubs and arrested their leaders. Gestapo counsel Werner Best issued a directive to the police forbidding issuance of firearm permits to Jews.

First let's start with the ultimate claims of this rabbit hole so we know what we are diving into.

David Icke was the first person that I heard make the claim that the satanic pedophilies running the world are serving something immaterial or metaphysical. Icke claims that the immaterial god/beings that they serve feed off of dark energy which is most proficiently produced through negative human emotion.

Ok so ya whatever a lifetime conspiracy theorist makes some outlandish claims, what’s the big deal? However, I was still so goddamn curious as to why these powerful elite were so religious, like there *can't* be nothing legitimate behind all these rituals, killings, symbolism etc. So even though I knew Icke’s claims sounded crazy they were the only ideas that seemed to offer a potential answer to my questions.

So I started looking deeper, started to look for other people making these claims. I specifically focused on whistleblowers because for something this sci-fi sounding I needed something legit. After hours of listening/reading various types of testimony against shadow governments and pedophilic elite I finally came across Ronald Bernard. He was a higher up in the financial industry who most of you know from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC62iJ_oXDE&t=1767s) viral video where he reveals inner illuminati-serving circles performing child sacrifice in the name of Lucifer. This video was a “part 1” of a five part confession by this man Ronald Bernard. I finally came across [this video.](https://youtu.be/D0i6A_fLsN4?t=1231) Bingo. Not only does he state that there is an out-of-dimension force which is the source of this entire thing, but he explains that they are constantly feeding off of this dark energy to this day.  In [this interview,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA3BDYpkDbo&feature=youtu.be&t=2816) Bernard expands on this idea greatly in-depth I highly recommend for anyone who is still taking me seriously at this point.

&#x200B;

**-Carr’s and the CIA’s claims here are specifically derived from the quantum mechanics theory called the holographic theory. Which I will further elaborate here:**

“Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.” -Albert Einstein

Einstein was the first physicist to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (*h*) **would require a rewriting of the laws of physics**

*""Theoretical physicists and astrophysicists, investigating irregularities in the cosmic microwave background (the 'afterglow' of the Big Bang), have found there is substantial evidence supporting a holographic explanation of the universe --* [*in fact, as much as there is for the traditional explanation of these irregularities using the theory of cosmic inflation*](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm)*""*

*""*[*The universe*](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm) *could turn out to be a “vast and complex hologram”, meaning that life in 3D is an illusion, astrophysicists have said. Researchers from the University of Southampton, working with colleagues from Canada and Italy, say they have found substantial evidence of a holographic universe – an idea first suggested in the 1990s"".*

[What is the structure of space and time](https://www.ellines.com/en/good-news/32848-is-the-universe-a-hologram-the-greek-researcher-behind-the-findings-explains/)*? Has time a beginning or the Universe has always existed? These are some of the questions that concerned humans since ancient times. In the first moments of the Universe, the entire Universe was “compressed” into such a small space that only a quantum theory of gravity could describe it. Theoretical research in quantum gravity in the last 20 years has given evidence that the Universe is holographic, meaning that at a fundamental level the Universe is two-dimensional (plus the time) and the extra dimension (and gravity) is the result of the dynamic theory. The purpose of my recent work has been to look for observational evidence of holography in the primordial cosmic radiation. This radiation comes from the first moments of the Universe and its structure contains information about the laws of nature in the primordial Universe. We found that all the observations can be explained by a holographic model and that the observational data is equally compatible with both the new holographic model and the standard model of cosmology” Professor Skenderis said at ellines.com*

""*We know today that man, essentially, is a being of light. And the modern science of photobiology … is presently proving this. In terms of healing the implications are immense. We now know, for example, that quanta of light can initiate, or arrest, cascade-like reactions in the cells, and that genetic cellular damage can be virtually repaired, within hours, by faint beams of light. We are still on the threshold of fully understanding the complex relationship between light and life, but we can now say emphatically, that the function of our entire metabolism is dependent on light.”* \~ Dr. Fritz Albert Popp, The International Institute of Biophysics

&#x200B;

* ***Ok so now we see that it is a legitimate scientific contention that our consciousness is capable of transcending the space-time dimension. What do these ideas imply?***

Assume for now that everything you have read thus far is 100% non-debatable reality. We are all metaphysical beings experiencing an artificial time-space reality, and our material bodies are really nothing. We are all capable of manifesting both light energy and dark energy which profoundly affects our metaphysical “bodies” or spirits.

Ok, now realize that the world we are in, which is materially-controlled by 8,000-8,500 people, is systematically designed to create as much misery, death (negative emotion) as possible as long as it stays under the illusion of a free world. Think of it, these higher ups have bought-out and rigged every influential governmental/private entity so that wars could be artificially instigated, and children can be freely systematically trafficked internationally to be killed and raped. Are any of you actually surprised that the people who are at the top of this all and call all of these inhumane shots are actually *worshiping* Lucifer and practice satanic rituals? Like no shit they are serving an immaterial evil force

**Now check out this quote from Ronald Bernard's viral video:**

*“And then you can say religion is a fairytale, God doesn't exist, none of that is real. Well for these people it is truth and reality, and they served something immaterial, what they called Lucifer”- Ronald Bernard*

&#x200B;

1. ***Obviously the people who materially run our world are focused on manifesting as much of this dark energy as possible to serve Lucifer, but where did these ideas come from?***

Just think about mainstream religions today and how little role they play in the life of the masses. What’s different about the Luciferian religion? How does it continue to convince the most powerful and educated people in the world to worship and serve an immaterial force when mainstream religions continue to become more and more mockable in public discourse.

After deeply researching the history and [reading about](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm) emergences of many religions, I think I came up with an answer. All of the mainstream religions that we see practiced today were previously watered-down and altered by ancient elite intelligentsia who believed the masses could not be given the entirety of the actual truth. So you may be wondering what I mean by ‘watered-down’.... watered down from what? They have been watered-down from the understanding of the metaphysical reality and capabilities of man.  Here I will painstakingly try and explain:

*“*[Amongst the ancients](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm)*, knowledge was only transmitted to men whose worth had been proved by a series of tests. This transmittal took place in the temples, under the name of mysteries, and the adept assumed the title of priest or Initiate.  This science was therefore secret or occult, and thus originated the name of occult science, given by our contemporaries to the ancient synthesis.”*

[http://www.istitutocintamani.org/libri/The\_secret\_teachings\_of\_all\_ages.pdf](http://www.istitutocintamani.org/libri/The_secret_teachings_of_all_ages.pdf)

[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm)

Consider the fact that:

*“*[Among the](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm) *ancients, philosophy, science, and religion were never considered as separate units: each was regarded as an integral part of the whole. Philosophy was scientific and religious; science was philosophical and religious I religion was philosophic and scientific. Perfect wisdom was considered unattainable save as the result of harmonizing all three of these expressions of mental and moral activity.”*

***...It becomes obvious that throughout large parts of human history, a very very small minority of elite individuals retained total control over the research and understanding of the most fundamental fields of studies regarding human nature.***

*However, when the Initiates found that a time was approaching when these doctrines might be lost to humanity, they made strenuous efforts to ensure the passing down of this knowledge through future generations.* [Three great methods were used for this purpose--](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm)

**1. Secret societies, a direct continuation of the** ***Mysteries***\*\*;\*\*

**2. The cultus, a symbolic translation of the higher doctrines, for the use of the people;**

***(Cultus=a system or variety of religious worship)***

**3. Lastly, the people itself became the unconscious depository of the doctrine.**

**MAIN IDEA:** The ancients studying these exclusive and profound knowledge of philosophy, science, and religion purposely and systematically diluted the information they chose to pass down to the masses. By doing this, they have made an ongoing elite ""sector"" of knowledge which we continue to suffer from.

They only allowed this knowledge to be passed down through elite secret societies; or on the other hand to be watered-down and manipulated by ancient priests to appease to the ignorant masses in different countries. (See point 2 above)

**Key takeaway:** The masses are still actively being kept ignorant of the true metaphysical nature of the universe. This massive knowledge gap explains the existence and need for secret societies amongst the elite.

*-----“To any one possessing the key,* ***all these Bibles reveal the same doctrine***\*; but this key, which can open Esoterism, is lost by the sectarians of our Western creeds.”\*

\-------*“Every priest of an ancient creed was one of the Initiates, that is to say,* ***he knew perfectly well that only one religion existed, and that the cultus merely served to translate this religion to the different nations according to their particular temperaments.:”***

***Key takeaway:*** Luciferiansim was directly derived from this original universal doctrine, crafting its spiritual outlook of the world along the proper lines, unlike the artificially structured religions practiced today.

***3. Ok, so now we know that all of the various religions today were derived from an ancient form of knowledge which has been hidden from the masses forever. But what exactly is this secret knowledge?***

When Alexander the Great built the city of Alexandria in Egypt, with the intention of making it the seat of his empire, he invited learned men from all nations, who brought with them their peculiar notions. **The Alexandria School of Philosophy which was thus established, by the commingling of Orientalists, Jews, Egyptians, and Greeks, became eclectic in character, and exhibited a heterogeneous mixture of the opinions of the Egyptian priests, of the Jewish Rabbis, of Arabic teachers, and of the disciples of Plato and Pythagoras.**  *From this school we derive* [***Gnosticism***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnosticism) *and the  Kabbala\], and, above all, the system of* *symbolism* *and* *allegory* *which lay at the* ***foundation of the Masonic philosophy***\*.\*

* [The school](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm)***of Alexandria was the principal source from which the secret societies of the West arose.***
* ***T***[he Gnostic se](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/tob/tob03.htm)***cts, the Arabs, Alchemists, Templars, Rosicrucians, and lastly the Freemasons, form the Western chain in the transmission of occult science.***

**4.** ***Now that we know Gnosticism is the hidden knowledge which inspired secret societies in the west, let's take a look at a some of them and see what they believe.***

[**Rosicrucian Cosmo Conception**](http://www.rosicrucian.com/pdf_plaza/Rosicrucian%20Cosmo-Conception.pdf)

*“The first step is the study of the invisible Worlds. These Worlds are invisible to the majority of people because of the dormancy of the finer and higher senses whereby they may be perceived, in the same way that the Physical World about us is perceived through the physical senses. The majority of people are on a similar footing in regard to the superphysical Worlds as the man who is born blind is to our world of sense; although light and color are all about him, he is unable to see them. To him they are non-existent and incomprehensible, simply because he lacks the sense of sight wherewith to perceive them. Objects he can”*

*“The Mason views life seriously, realizing that every wasted moment is a lost opportunity, and that Omnipotence is gained only through earnestness and endeavor. Above all other relationships he recognizes the* ***universal brotherhood of every living thing***\*. The symbol of the clasped hands, explained in the Lodge, reflects his attitude towards all the world, for he is the comrade of all created things.\* ***He realizes also that his spirit is a glowing, gleaming jewel which he must enshrine within a holy temple built by the labor of his hands, the meditation of his heart, and the aspiration of his soul.****”*

*“The leading Masonic scholars of all times have agreed that the symbols of the Fraternity are susceptible of the most profound interpretation and thus reveal to the truly initiated certain secrets concerning the* ***spiritual realities of life***\*.:\*

[**Knights of Templar**](http://www.knightstemplarorder.org/templar-spirituality/)

*Templar spirituality is characterized by reverence of the “Divine Feminine” aspect of God, individual daily prayer, frequent spiritual meditation, including with vocal chanting, esoteric “energy work” as spiritual alchemy involving “Chakras”, and “metaphysical science” exploring spiritual energies.*

5. ***Obviously the main tenet of all of these secret societies is the emphasis-on and full-belief of both the metaphysical, and spiritual reality of nature.***

**TLDR:** Let's do a recap because I know part I a lot. Evil, yet very religious and spiritual people, run and control everything on earth. They worship and dedicate their life to an immaterial spiritual force called Lucifer. Our society is entirely structured and manipulated by these Luciferians so that it serves their religion most effectively. All modern religion is a watered-down manipulated version of the ancient elite ruling class’s entire knowledge of humanity; we are fed the same shit they trusted the peasant’s with. This ancient secret knowledge, which reveals that man is more than a material being, has inspired all of the elite and influential secret societies in the west today.

&#x200B;

**Wanna go down an inter-dimensional rabbit hole? Part II:**  will tie this all together by examining the ancient spiritual origins of evil and the history of it ever since. All of the ancient texts which I have shown you this far only talk about metaphysics and spirituality in their original sense which focuses on light and positive energy manifestation. This next post will talk about how/why the most powerful people on the planet chose to adhere to spiritual principles in the opposite manner, evil. What do they gain, why is Lucifer their god of choice, how deep does this go? Find out sometime next week",conspiracy,CIA

206,Where is Julian Assange?,1217.0,595o8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/,574.0,1477328714.0,"**What are the options?**

Is Assange ""still"" alive (as WikiLeaks, perhaps tellingly, asserts), and if so, where is he? There are several possible permutations. Either:

1. Assange is alive and well in the Ecuadorian Embassy in Hans Crescent, London, and simply keeping his head down (possibly in an attempt to create a news story and give more publicity to WikiLeaks).

2. Assange is alive and has miraculously managed to escape from the Embassy without being picked up the UK police or CIA who were monitoring the building, and has reached or is making his way to, a safe haven (eg Russia). 

3. Assange is still alive, but now in captivity. This could be inside the Embassy, but far more likely, he has been removed and handed to the US authorities who have him in custody on ""US controlled territory"" (and where it is quite likely he is being tortured, like the thousands of nameless other ""enemy combatants"" before him).

4. Assange has been murdered (possibly by poisoning). Either his body is being stored in a freezer at the Embassy building until the  ""appropriate"" time to announce his death, or it may have already been removed. 

5. It is also possible that Assange was removed (or left) the Embassy alive, but has since been killed (ie a combination of 3 and 4).

6. An option I did not initially consider is that Assange could have [realised his arrest was imminent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T_h7pSVIFo) and taken an extreme, but logical step to ensure that he wasn't captured. When faced with the prospect of torture, suicide would be the rational choice. Of course suicide may yet be presented as the official cause of death, and ironically, many people will not believe it.

7. Edit: It has long been argued that Assange (like Snowden) is a government agent, or limited hangout, working for US/UK interests, or even Russia. Alternatively, Assange could be in the process of becoming a limited hangout, perhaps agreeing to redact/restrict the most damaging of the documents in his possession in return for his freedom. 

**What does the evidence point to?**

The best ""evidence"" we have at the moment is several testimonials which purport that Assange is alive and well, inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, or news stories which are designed to make people infer that this is the case. **However, these stories are either inconclusive, suspect or have been proven to be false, in other words they may just be distractions and misdirection.** There have been [other posts covering this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58n6w4/is_assange_alive_has_wikileaks_been_compromised_a/), but these distraction stories include:

 * the Pamela Anderson vegan sandwich visit on 15 October (somewhat compromised by her cryptic ""torture"" reference). [Update: Pamela Anderson has tweeted this ""gift"" of two mice for Assange's cat on 25 October](https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/790914144748892160?lang=it)
 * the statement by Ecuador that they were cutting off Assange's internet on October 16 (a cover story to obscure the fact Assange was already incapable of communicating?)
 * the [Wikileaks employee visit/tweet](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1995230/bizarre-internet-theory-that-julian-assange-was-poisoned-by-pamela-anderson-with-vegan-sandwich-from-pret-as-his-internet-is-mysteriously-cut/) on 17 October [(since disavowed)](https://twitter.com/kellykolisnik/status/787932228994990080)
 * the [Craig Murray whisky visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58j0y7/craig_murray_the_former_british_ambassador_to/) on October 18.
 * the numerous old Assange videos being re-posted as ""news""
 * the idiotic red herring story involving images of Assange's ""escape"" [(which were actually Google StreetView images from two years ago)](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58ub39/has_cryptomeorg_twitter_account_been_compromised/)
 * the 4-month old [Michael Moore video](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/593prn/latest_sign_wikileaks_is_compromised_they/) being touted as current by WikiLeaks.
 * the Wikileaks promises to provide hard evidence of Assange's situation which have been reneged on.
 * Weird tweets from WikiLeaks generally, including a ridiculous accusation that a major US ddos was the work of WikiLeaks supporters.

Conversely, whilst there is an ""absence of positive evidence"" that Assange has been harmed or abducted from the Ecuadorian Embassy, there are numerous reasons to suggest this might the case.

 * Final tweet from account known to be controlled by Julian Assange (Embassy Cat) on 15 October.
 * the release of Wikileaks codes on 16 October
 * the [cancellation of the October 17 interview by Swedish prosecutors at the Ecuadorian Embassy.](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/date-set-questioning-julian-assange-rape-allegation)
 * Bystander reports of [police/swat activity outside the Ecuadorian Embassy on 17 October](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/57vu5l/red_alert_wikileaks_on_twitter_julian_assanges/d8vfhtg/) and a forcible abduction.
 * A cryptic tweet from WikiLeaks [confirming armed police outside the Ecuadorian Embassy](http://www.trunews.com/article/wikileaks-armed-police-appear-at-ecuador-embassy-in-london), corroborating the forcible abduction story
 * there have been at least 9 days of non-communication by Assange,
 * no proof of life provided, and no PGP signed document, despite repeated requests
 * no rational explanation for this silence
 * the sudden death of Gavin MacFadyen, the third (known) senior member of Wikileaks to die suddenly this year
 * this redditor who visited Hans Crescent on 22 October, to find there was [no police presence guarding the Embassy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5941hn/my_visit_to_the_ecuadorian_embassy_221016/) Assange was under siege for over four years, with a permanent police detail outside the Embassy, with orders to arrest him if he tried to leave. Why were they removed?
 * [Mark Halperin of Politico attempted to meet with Assange on Friday 21, but was refused by a goon: ""Assange too busy""- video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MJAvCqVIXw)

Bearing in mind the above, and the highly suspicious nature of the so-called ""evidence"" asserting that he is in good health, I think it is reasonable at this point to suspect that Assange has either been killed and/or is no longer inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, so either options 3 or 4, or probably both (option 5) bearing in mind that the US elite will not want to give Assange a trial where he could reveal any more information.

Finally, if Assange has been subjected to extraordinary rendition and/or killed, we must assume that the UK, the US and the Ecuadorian governments are all complicit. It would mean that Ecuador's President Rafael Correa was somehow turned by the US authorities (be it via money or threats, or both [concerning Ecuador's gold reserves being held in the US](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d9641pq/)) into secretly revoking Assange's asylum. It would also mean that the UK authorities have illegally handed over Assange to the Americans without due legal process, knowing that Assange would be tortured and probably killed.

But...let's hope this has all been a bad dream. 

At this point, however, I think the best we can hope for is that Assange is fine and still in the Ecuadorian Embassy, because I think the escape option is by far the least likely of all these scenarios.

TLDR: There has been no proof of life of Julian Assange for at least 9 days. Instead we have seen a raft of distraction stories (even from WikiLeaks itself) which are clearly designed to give **the impression** that Assange is alive and well. Some of these stories have been shown to be old footage or otherwise bogus. So it appears that WikiLeaks is compromised and that probably means Assange is no longer in the safety of the Ecuadorian Embassy. I supect the US authorities probably have the most information about Assange, and his current whereabouts, and we should probably fear the worst.

EDIT: As mentioned briefly above, Julian Assange was due to be interviewed by Swedish prosecutors last week - on 17th October, at a meeting inside the Embassy. [However, this meeting was called off just five days beforehand, on Wednesday 12 October,](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59agk0/the_guardian_reported_on_12_oct_link_that_julian/)  ostensibly because the lawyers ""couldn't make it"". This made me wonder whether it was perhaps Assange who was not available - in other words, could Assange have been out of commission earlier than we realised? Unlikely, perhaps.

Not knowing when the Assange disappearance timeline truly begins is making it harder to discover what has happened to him.That said, the publication of WikiLeaks codes on twitter shortly after the Pamela Anderson ""vegan torture"" visit on 15 October is the most obvious starting point in the chronology.

NOTE (26 October): I am updating this page as new information comes in. If you think there is something I have missed out, please notify me in the comments.

EDIT: 26 October 22.15 GMT. ""Julian Assange"" is apparently participating over telephone link to the CISL Conference.  Opinions?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUYXZMNlBU&feature=youtu.be

EDIT: The ""Assange phone-in"" has finished, but can stil be accessed in the above link. Assange is introduced starting around 3h.15 - you don't see him, only hear him. Please listen to Assange's comments (via phone link) and decide for yourself.

EDIT: Transcript of ""Assange's"" answers during the conference call by /u/qrestlove [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59jyze/julian_assangesupposedly_on_a_spanish_tv_show/) 

EDIT: In my view, that sounded like Julian Assange talking. However, I am by no means certain, and I note plenty of you think it definetely was NOT Assange, so I am keeping an open mind. The Caller referenced his internet being cut off at the Embassy, and the telephone call (to a public CISL event) **appeared** to be live. At this point we can't be certain, so this event doesn't qualify as a proof of life. The whole episode was decidedly odd, seeing as there was zero advance publicity from him or the event organisers about him being a contributor to the conference.

It certainly leaves many questions unanswered about his physical and legal status, his current location and ultimately whether Julian Assange is himself entirely legit, or perhaps some sort of limited hangout. 

EDIT: Or perhaps he has been legit up until now, but, as /u/founthead posits, is [in the process of becoming a limited hangout, to secure his freedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d99pj0t/)?

EDIT: John Pilger has published an article, based on a lecture he gave yesterday (27 October) at the Sheffield Festival of Words in which he states: 

**""That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.""**

The article is here: http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/28/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-trump/

John Pilger's website is [here](http://johnpilger.com/). Pilger is a journalistic legend and a friend of Julian Assange, and although it goes without saying, this is not a formal proof of life, Pilger's ""truth"" credentials are pretty much unrivalled. It should be stressed that Pilger and Wikileaks have stressed Assange is ""alive"" but not his whereabouts.

EDIT: This post is being unstickied as it has become unwieldy. Sadly, we are no nearer establishing exactly where Julian Assange is, but (what I believe to be credible) information has materialised which suggests he is ""still alive"". However, there is no sign that Assange is ""still in the Ecuadorian Embassy"", and he apparently hasn't been there since about the 17 October. ",conspiracy,CIA

Furthermore, former NYC mayor Giuliani testified to the 9/11 Commission: """"... the reason Pier 92 was selected as a command center was because on the next day, on September 12, Pier 92 was going to have a drill, it had hundreds of people here, from FEMA, from the Federal Government, from the State, from the State Emergency Management Office, and they were getting ready for a drill for biochemical attack. So that was gonna be the place they were going to have the drill. The equipment was already there, so we were able to establish a command center there, within three days, that was two and a half to three times bigger than the command center that we had lost at 7 World Trade Center.

According to CBS News, in the afternoon before the attack, “alarm bells were sounding over unusual trading in the US stock options market.” It has been documented that the CIA, the Mossad, and many other intelligence agencies monitor stock trading in real time using highly advanced programs such as Promis. Both the FBI and the Justice Department have confirmed the use of such programs for US intelligence gathering through at least this summer. This would confirm that the CIA should have had additional advance warning of imminent attacks against American and United Airlines planes.

>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.

This one really struck me:

> In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

Also, a Muslim was in charge of the CTC at CIA for almost 10 years. Is this new information? I've read Mr. Morell's book and did not know it.

> In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.’s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks

With Trump about to begin intelligence briefings from the CIA, what do we know about Trump's relationship to the intelligence community? Is Mr. Morrell's endorsement of Clinton indicative of wider sentiment?

On the other hand, Trump's supporters are happy to wage war on the ""deep state,"" coming from the mentality that unelected intelligence bureaucrats should not impede ""their"" president. 




Where are the nuanced perspectives here? Without making all world politics into a CIA plot, we can see that anonymous sources making waves every day on the news have a huge impact on American society. All we have to go by to learn these people's sources is the simple assumption that leakers do it because they want to protect American democracy from Trump. Yet there are official channels whereby these things could come out. 





IC activities represent a complication of our understanding of the sovereignty of states. If the official elected state apparatus isn't aware of what IC members are doing, in what sense do the American people hold sovereignty in their ability to vote based on the actions of their representatives? If the norms of ""American democracy"" are to be held and kept by individuals who are ultimately unelected and unaccountable, how can there be trust that ours will remain on open society?




How should we think about the role of intelligence agencies in democratic society?

16,Was the removal of former CIA director John Brennan's security clearances justified?,217.0,97o78j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/97o78j/was_the_removal_of_former_cia_director_john/,352.0,1534384463.0,"So as you probably well know, today President Donald Trump removed the former director of the CIA John Brennan's security clearance due to ""erratic behavior"".

On the one hand, it seems very hard to deny that this decision was partly or entirely due to Brennan's vocal opposition of the Trump administration, and thus concerns regarding a violation of free speech arise.

On the other hand, the CIA does require former CIA officials to 'behage appropiately' per se in order to keep their clearance:

>[In the case of former CIA directors, the agency ""holds"" their security clearance and renews it every five years for the rest of their lives. **However, that requires former CIA directors to behave like current CIA employees if they want to keep their clearance, which means avoiding travel to certain countries and generally living in a manner above reproach**](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/security-clearances-how-do-they-work/)

A mixture of geo-politics, western mining interests, and good old fashioned racism led to the UN ratifying what was known to be a sham vote, with 1026 West-Papuans handpicked by Indonesia voting unanimously for Indonesian rule in 1969. The UN agreed they were ""too primitive"" for democracy, despite having already elected their own congress prior to Indonesias invasion.

And this despite knowing Suharto, the President of Indonesia, had just been responsible for the slaughter of half a million peasants. We know, because the CIA gave them death lists and logistical and diplomatic support.

Over 400,000 West Papuans are estimated to have been killed in the decades of occupation since then, and now they constitute a persecuted minority in their own land (and, as it goes, possess 15% of the worlds known languages). To this day, West Papuans are tortured and imprisoned for raising the Morning Star, their flag of Independence.

A key player in Indonesia's diplomatic support during the invasion was Henry Kissinger. Kissinger subsequently earned bank, to this day, from the Rio Tinto mining corporation that is devastating the forest of Papua (search Grasberg Mine on Google Earth, then scroll south down the valley - you can see the devastation from space), and hiring the Indonesian military - paying money directly into officers bank accounts - to protect the mine from tribes people with bows and spears.

Here is a link to the National Security Archives, in whose documents Kissinger is actually quoted as saying ""Anything on paper will be used against me"" in reference to restarting military sales to Indonesia against the orders of Congress.

Members of the Global Response Staff of the ground [have publicly stated numerous times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8V5p4sL2K0) that they received a ""stand down"" order. The CIA chief in Benghazi during the time [has stated this is false](

What does the wording of these articles say about the Kremlin's stance on the candidates?,81.0,4vz6gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4vz6gm/two_main_russian_state_media_outlets_have/,25.0,1470239554.0,"Excerpts and my analysis appear below

RT:

>Despite a concerted campaign in America to link the Republican nominee with the Kremlin, there is no evidence to support the narrative that the Russian government wants Donald Trump to become the next US President. 

>To anyone who lives in Russia, or has spent considerable time here, the notion that Moscow could recruit Trump and bend him to its bidding is frankly preposterous. Russia remains a great power, but one with considerable domestic challenges, economically and socially. As a consequence, its authorities, to state the completely obvious, have better things to do than conniving overseas on this scale. Not to mention that Trump is so erratic that you’d barely trust him with a drinks order, let alone a plan so cunning and convoluted that even John Le Carré wouldn’t touch it. It’s really that ludicrous.

>Armed with this knowledge, it’s reasonable to assume that Putin is not very excited about a putative US supremo, who in a moment of remarkable hyperbole, equated him to a man responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians. But that doesn’t mean Putin, a politician of immense experience, is overjoyed about the prospect of Trump either. If mere words were all it took to discommode the President, he’d hardly have survived close to two decades on the frontline of Russian politics.

>And so this brings us to the man they call ‘the Donald.’ It's hard to swallow the notion that Russia’s highly educated elite could favor anybody this uncouth and unstable. His foreign policy suggestions on NATO might sound like music to Kremlin ears, but the rest of his platform doesn’t. Trump isn’t merely proposing an American rethink on NATO-area Europe, but a wider American withdrawal from the world and an extremely isolationist outlook.

This appears very much addressed at the recent hacking controversy, but it looks to me to be almost as negative to Trump as to Clinton. 

Sputnik:

>Trump Probably Makes Russia Nervous Despite Backing Crimea Secession

>US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s call for improved relations with Moscow and his apparent backing of Crimea’s decision to secede from Ukraine are unlikely to inspire confidence in Russia.

>""It strains credulity beyond the breaking point that Putin would want Trump to be president of the United States, unpredictable as he is,"" McGovern, who briefed three US presidents and headed the CIA’s Soviet policy branch, told Sputnik on Monday.

>The whole premise is crazy, McGovern noted, that Trump’s embrace of better US-Russian ties somehow makes Putin a fan.

>""I know a little bit about Russian and Soviet leaders,” McGovern added.  “The last thing they want is somebody who is proud of being unpredictable and who gets irate at the slightest slight.”

>That Putin, McGovern added, would want Trump to have his finger on the nuclear button “is a leap of faith that I cannot possibly make and remain sane.”

>""With respect to Hillary, I’m saying there’s no lesser of two evils,"" McGovern said. ""I don’t think he [Putin] wants Trump to win. I don’t think he wants Hillary to win either.""

You guys seem to give the powers that be waaaay too much credit. A lot of these theories would involve hundreds, if not thousands of people working together. Our government is so fucking inept they can't pass a budget, I don't believe they are secretly plotting to destroy us. We live in an age where it is incredibly hard to keep information under wraps. Clinton got a blowjob from an intern and got busted when only three people knew what happened. Petreus, the head of the fucking CIA couldn't keep his affair quiet. Let me give two examples:

1) 9-11 terror attacks. One of the theories making the rounds is that the WTC towers were destroyed via ""controlled demolition"" by the US government, presumably to get us into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. If this was really the case, who set these explosives? Surely some twelve years later one of the guys who laid these explosives would have surfaced. Where are the plans? Where are the emails? Even if the explosives were laid, why crash the planes into the buildings? Wouldn't it be simpler to just use explosives? I don't doubt the government (Cheney and his croneys) snatched the chance to get rich by starting a war in Iraq, but I just don't buy the fact that the government was behind the WTC attacks.

2) Sandy Hook. The consensus of many conspiracy theorists on here is that the Sandy Hook massacre was fabricated, presumably in an attempt to ""take away our guns"". I have seen countless posts on here asking ""well, where are the bodies?"". This to me is just lunacy. Just think how many people would have to be in on this. The parents of 20 or so ""fake children"", the entire Sandy Hook police force and the EMT responders just to name a few. Doesn't it just make more sense that a wacked out nut job decided to go on a killing spree?

It seems from my perspective and my study of American history that this paradigm shift seems to be a result of the Iraq War. Opposition to the Iraq War became a defining issue for the Democrat/Republican split, and in turn we started to see it as a left-right issue, but it's never been that simple. I think we can see that from the behavior of the Obama administration, but also some context from the last century of American history.

For much of the 1920s and 1930s, the Republicans were the isolationist, non-interventionist party in American politics, especially when it concerned Europe, while the Democrats were more pro-globalization and pro-intervention. FDR was constantly pushing the US to get more involved in the global sphere, and Truman after him. The Cold War ushered in a new phase of American involvement, one that remained fairly consistent in a lot of ways due to the influence of the Establishment (big-E), a clique of State Department and Defense elites who (generally) pushed containment and domino theory.

In this context, we have the foreign policies of Ike, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon to look at. On a broad sense (excepting things like the CIA activities in Iran) it would appear that Kennedy and Johnson, Democrats considerably to the left domestically of Ike and Nixon, presided over the more interventionist policies, including Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, and the Dominican Republic. Nixon did end the war in Vietnam, but in this he seems to have played Obama to Johnson's Bush, trying a broader array of options to end hostilities in Southeast Asia with mixed results, some of which are quite reviled to this day. 

I'm not as familiar with the differences vis-a-vis Reagan, Bush Sr., and Clinton, but Reagan's military spending and rhetoric were obviously more interventionist and hawkish than Clinton - however, even with the reduction in defense spending, Clinton still had Bosnia and Somalia, as well as the low-key opening salvos of the War on Terror (though we didn't know it at the time.)

So this brings us to the modern day and the War on Terror. Had Al Gore been President when/if 9/11 occurred, then invaded Afghanistan and engaged in the other adventures to this date (probably not Iraq, but you never know), would we regard foreign intervention as a left-wing or Democrat ideal, considering that this could be seen as consistent to a degree with Clinton's foreign policy? Is the difference in rhetoric and defense spending the real dividing line, or are the actual results - which seem quite mixed between Democrat and Republican, or left and right - what truly matters here?

37,What do you think of Gamal Nasser and Muammar Gaddafi?,31.0,nbr1fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/nbr1fw/what_do_you_think_of_gamal_nasser_and_muammar/,44.0,1620938902.0,"Both were Cold War era North African leaders. Nasser led Egypt from 1952 to 1970, Gaddafi led Libya from 1969 to 2011.

Nasser died of a heart attack. Gaddafi was murdered by rebels during the Libyan Civil War in 2011.

Supporters of both would argue that they brought women's rights, social welfare, economic development, independence and political stability to a region of the world where these are sorely lacking. Gaddafi's supporters would also argue that the rebels were mostly fundamentalist Muslims backed by NATO and the CIA who were more interested in seizing Libya's large oil reserves and destroying his efforts to create a pan-African gold-backed currency.

Critics of both would argue they were totalitarians who violated human rights, sponsored terrorist attacks (in Gaddafi's case), wrecked the local environment (in Nasser's case with the Aswan Dam) and alienated numerous other countries with poorly planned foreign policy. Others may add that they screwed up their economies with mass nationalisations.

38,"The National Security Council has provided Trump a several options to the North Korea question, including killing Kim Jong-Un and placing nukes in South Korea. Which of the presented options do you think would be most effective and what do you expect Trump will do?",30.0,64392i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/64392i/the_national_security_council_has_provided_trump/,65.0,1491600262.0,"Options include:

- Nukes in South Korea:

>""We have 20 years of diplomacy and sanctions under our belt that has failed to stop the North Korean program,"" one senior intelligence official involved in the review told NBC News. ""I'm not advocating pre-emptive war, nor do I think that the deployment of nuclear weapons buys more for us than it costs,"" but he stressed that the U.S. was dealing with a ""war today"" situation. 

But...
>""I don't think that [deploying nuclear weapons] is a good idea. I think that it will only inflame the view from Pyongyang,"" retired Adm. James Stavridis told NBC News. ""I don't see any upside to it because the idea that we would use a nuclear weapon even against North Korea is highly unlikely.""

- Kill Kim Jong-Un:

Adopting such an objective has huge downsides, said Lippert, who also served as an assistant defense secretary under President Barack Obama.

>""Discussions of regime change and decapitation...tend to cause the Chinese great pause of concern and tends to have them move in the opposite direction we would like them to move in terms of pressure,"" he said.

- Covert action

infiltrating U.S. and South Korean special forces into North Korea to sabotage or take out key infrastructure — for instance, blowing up bridges to block the movement of mobile missiles. The CIA, which would oversee such operations, told NBC News it could offer ""no guidance"" on this option. But Stavridis said that he felt it was the ""best strategy"" should the U.S. be forced to take military action. He described such action as: ""some combination of special forces with South Korea and cyber.""


The Trump White House, through the National Security Council, asked for blue sky options in early February, a senior official told NBC on background. ""Think big,"" the official said that the agencies were instructed. Many proposales have already been abandoned, but on the military side, sources say, the three options with the highest impact still constitute the next steps.

So which option is best, can you think of something better, and what's Trump gonna do?

What the CIA did was wrong because it was torture, NOT because it involved experimentation. Basically, they were trying to learn from what they were doing to make to make their interrogations more effective. The wanting to learn part is not a bad thing. What is bad is the fact that they violated the human rights of prisoners. I feel like emphasizing experimentation is steering focus away from the central issue of torture. We should want the feds to be focused on learning and improving, especially learning from their mistakes. And if, as is probably true, torture doesn't even provide useful intelligence, then we'd want the CIA to be intelligent and observant enough to come to that conclusion. Why are so many people convinced that experimenting somehow makes it worse?",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA
40,Axios Biden cabinet picks,30.0,fgc3xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/fgc3xj/axios_biden_cabinet_picks/,304.0,1583838413.0,"Axios did [an article on Biden's cabinet](https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-cabinet-vice-president-picks-b17882ac-3953-450f-8afb-38a3c8dcda57.html).  This list is likely people around Biden trying to trial balloon some names to see if anyone raises objections they hadn't thought of.  But figured it does make for interesting discussion.  So what do you all think of these trial balloons?  

**VP**:

* Warren for V.P. to excite party progressives.
* Sen. Kamala Harris (first on many lists) and Sen. 
* Cory Booker
* Gov. Deval Patrick
* Stacey Abrams, who electrifies crowds.
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar is in the mix, too. 
* Tammy Duckworth of Illinois 
* Rep. Val Demings of Florida
* ""Whoever Jim Clyburn wants it to be.""

**Attorney General**: 
* Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general under Obama who stood up to Trump and was fired, would be a leading contender for attorney general.
* The sources see Harris as a promising choice for attorney general if she's not on the ticket.

**Treasury Secretary**: 

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren as Treasury secretary could help unite the party.
* Jamie Dimon — chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and mentioned over the years as a potential presidential candidate — would also be considered for Treasury.
* Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America, is another possibility for Treasury.


**State**
* Tony Blinken, deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser under Obama, could go to State or become national security adviser.

* Susan Rice, formerly President Obama's national security adviser, is another option for State.

* John Kerry would love to take a new Cabinet position devoted to climate change, or might even accept a curtain call to return as secretary of state.

**Diplomacy related**
* Biden advisers expect Pete Buttigieg to get a prominent slot after his swift endorsement of Biden — perhaps as ambassador to the UN, or as U.S. trade representative. Both would help credential Buttigieg for a future national campaign.  

* Mike Bloomberg, who swiftly endorsed Biden after the former mayor's campaign collapsed, would be a top possibility to head the World Bank.

**Defense related**

* Michèle Flournoy, an Obama undersecretary of defense, would be the favorite to run Biden's Pentagon.

* Tom Donilon, national security adviser under Obama, would be considered for CIA director, director of national intelligence, or secretary of state.

**Commerce related**

* Morgan Stanley exec Tom Nides could get secretary of commerce, trade rep or some other top post.



**Chief of Staff & Related**

* The chief of staff would likely be Ron Klain, who held that job for him when he was veep.

* Ambassador Cathy Russell, a top State Department official for Obama who earlier was chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden.

* Ambassador Cathy Russell, a top State Department official for Obama who earlier was chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden.

* Ted Kaufman, former senator from Delaware, has been in Biden's inner circle forever. 

* Steve Ricchetti could be counselor, along with Mike Donilon, Biden's longtime political guru.

* Anita Dunn, who helped turn around the campaign and bring in more money, also might go inside.


**Others**
* Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware also might get a big job.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA
41,Looking at some possible names for a Donald Trump running mate,25.0,40qqec,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/40qqec/looking_at_some_possible_names_for_a_donald_trump/,52.0,1452665402.0,"Big problem with trying to predict who Trump might pack as running mate, is that he's so god damn unpredictable. Same goes for trying to predict anything else he'll say or do. 

What might he want in a Vice President? A respected politician? A base-appeasing nutjob? A fellow businessman outsider? Someone with a military or defense background? Or something else? An actor maybe? There are so many options and variables at play here, but let's look at a few names. Some a lot more likely than others. Some more serious. Some less so. 

We'll split them up into some rough categories, just to make things easier.

---

Here we go:

**The Politicians**
 
**Rudy Giuliani**. Former Mayor of New York. He's likeable, people respect the guy, he has said nice things about Trump, and vice-versa. Also, [this is a thing that happened once](http://i.imgur.com/CEApMYE.gif). Problems? They're both old white guys from New York -- and that's an issue that'll come up with a few other names as well. So, not exactly balancing the ticket. 

**Jeff Sessions**. Senator from Alabama. Happens to agree with Trump on his main issue -- Immigration. Is from the South. Appeals to the more conservative conservatives. Has plenty of political experience, which is something Trump may be looking for in a running mate. Or maybe it's something he wants to avoid. Who the hell knows. 

**Ted Cruz**. Senator from Texas. The 'birther' thing that came up recently might scupper this idea, but Trump seems to have left the door open by saying that all Cruz would have to do is go to court and make sure it's all nice and legal - he even said he thought he'd win. So if Trump does pick Cruz, you can expect that little bit of theater to play itself out. 

**Virgil Goode**. Former Congressman from Virginia. As of writing this, he is the *only* congressman, current or former, to have endorsed Trump. No endorsements from any senators or governors, current or former, either. Probably means nothing, but I figured I thought I should include him anyway. Just in case. 

**Newt Gingrich**. Former Speaker of the House. Back in late 2011, when Gingrich was running for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump came *this* close to hosting and moderating a candidates debate of his own. Yeah, really. Most of the candidates balked at the idea and pledged not to turn up, which basically killed it and stopped it from happening, but two of them accepted the invitation to the debate - **Rick Santorum** and Newt Gingrich. Interesting bit of trivia there. Now, if Trump wants someone with an inside knowledge of congress and how it all works, can you really do better than a former Speaker?  

**Elizabeth Dole**. Former Senator from North Carolina. Served in cabinet positions in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations. Now does a lot of work for wounded veterans - which is a cause [Trump really wants to attach himself to](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/600783533171441664). She's pretty old, but hey, she's a woman. Women live longer. 

**The Nutjobs**

**Sarah Palin**. Former Governor of Alaska. Still popular, somehow. She's been on friendly terms with Trump, both speaking fondly of each other. Would he make the same mistake McCain did, and pick her as his running mate? I doubt it. But who knows, maybe Trump really is a moron.

**Michele Bachmann**. Former Congresswoman from Minnessota. Same deal. Rabidly religious and Tea Party-approved. He'd be an idiot to pick her, but hey, maybe he is. Maybe he wants to secure the Tea Party support with his running mate. If that's the case, I'm sure Bachmann's on the list. 

**Allen West**. Former Congressman from Florida. Big Tea Party guy. Black. Ex-military. From a swing state. An outsider, with experience in congress. Now rns a nutty right-wing blog. He ticks plenty of boxes, and if those things are what Trump's looking for, he'd be a solid choice. 

**Ann Coulter**. Political pundit. Professional troll. Huge Trump supporter. Who the fuck knows. 

**Pat Buchanan**. Once ran against Trump in 2000, very briefly, when they were both competing for the Reform Party nomination. Some nasty attacks were thrown each way. Now, they're more friendly, Pat's been saying some very complimentary things about Trump and his campaign, and Trump said nice things back on twitter. He does have an age problem. Problem being that he's ancient. But if Trump wants a guy that'll make him look young and sprightly, well, why not Pat?
 
**The Business People and Billionaires**

**Carl Icahn**. Personal friend, and fellow billionaire. He has talked him up so much on the campaign trail, mentioning him in almost every speech -- to big applause, every time. His endorsement is the one Trump values the most, it seems. And he's touted him as a possible Secretary of the Treasury, he picked up his pet-issue of corporate inversions, and has talked about putting him in charge of negotiating trade deals with China - and what better position to do that from than the office of Vice President?

Or if you prefer your billionaires to be more celebrity-like, why not **Mark Cuban** or **Vince McMahon**? Both very high-profile, with good history with Trump. If he wants someone as colorful as himself as possible, those two names would work out great. **Oprah Winfrey** probably wouldn't go for it, but The Donald himself has mentioned the idea before, so I feel like I ought to mention it too. 

**Herman Cain**. Who recently appeared at one of Trump's rallies. He's rich, he's black, and he's Tea Party approved. And he's a great public speaker when he's not quoting Pokemon.

**The Military People**

**John Bolton**. Former US ambassador to the United Nations. Trump has said good things about him, and Bolton has said, well, lukewarm, things about Trump. But hey, Trump likes him, so that's something. He's tough, he's smart, he has a military background - kinda, he's experienced. We all know how much Trump loves his smart people, and Bolton is very smart. He knows his shit, and has one hell of a reputation of being a hard-ass. 

**David Petreaus**. Former CIA director. Rest of resume too long to list. Trump often invokes his name, and scandal, in speeches - usually to attack Hillary Clinton - but he does nonetheless say good things about him, and he always talks about finding our generations' 'McCarthur or Patton'. So why not pick him as Vice President, let him head up the war effort from that position? 

**Jim Webb**. Former Senator from Virginia. Won his seat on an anti-Iraq war platform. Vietnam veteran. Was Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan. Has been a Republican, an independent, and a Democrat. And so has Trump. And as far as I can tell, they're both mostly aligned with eachother on foreign policy, and on guns, and being against all that is 'politcally correct'. He'd be a really solid choice. 

**Wesley Clark**. Highly decorated Army General. Huge list of accomplishments in his military career. In 2004, he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination on an anti-Iraq war platform. And, more recently, has floated the idea of 'internment camps' for radicalized Americans. I think he and Trump would get along just fine. 

**The Others**

**Jesse Ventura**. Former Governor of Minnessota. And also a wrestler, author, tv host, actor, navy veteran, and professional conspiracy theorist. Probably the only one who could fit in either of the above categories. Back in 2000, Ventura was a big part of Trump's decision to (very briefly) run for the Reform Party's nomination. He dropped out of that race early on, but maybe there's still a little love there. 

**Kelsey Grammer**. I'll be honest, I just googled 'Republican actors' and his name came up. Apparently he's supporting Ben Carson, so at least he's not averse to supporting nutty outsider candidates. Seems like he'd be a good public speaker too, what with being an actor and all, and has shown interest in entering elected politics before. So why not? He was great at playing a politician in Boss. 

**James Woods** too. Another big-name conservative actor. Very politically active - just check his twitter if you need proof. He's for Ted Cruz right now though, but that's no big deal. And talk about smart, we all know how much Trump values intelligence, and Woods' high IQ is legendary. 

As for other actors, **Clint Eastwood** also crossed my mind, but the man is old enough to be Trump's father. 

**Larry Kudlow**. Conservative economist and TV host. Has been hinting at a possible run for senate this year, but what about a spot on a presidential ticket? He's a big fan of Trump's tax plan, and if Trump wants his economic policy to be the main focal point of his general election campaign, getting an economist like Kudlow to sell it to the electorate as his running mate could be a terrific idea. 

**Bill O'Reilly**. Fox News host. Personal friend of Trump. Incredibly intelligent guy, and he debates well. Just watch him argue with his guests on his show. Or any interaction he has had with Jon Stewart. If Trump's main concern is finding someone who can hold their own in a one-on-one televised debate with whomever the Democratic pick is, I honestly don't think there's a better choice than Bill O'Reilly. Also [here's a gif of them both doing a terrible Mexican wave](http://i.imgur.com/xbn4mnV.gifv). 

---

That's all the names I got for now. Again -- I know, there are some *very* unlikely names up there. But I did try and make a little case for each, and I think all are at least somewhat possible. Also, this thread was edited from an older, similar comment I made a while ago, most of it was changed, but if it feels familiar, that's why. 

So what do you think? Any particularly strong names up there? Any particularly dumb? And if you reckon I missed out anyone obvious, or you have any less-obvious picks, please go ahead and share them in the comments, would love to see them.   ",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

45,"Why is ""not doing harm"" not a government priority?",21.0,2quwe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2quwe9/why_is_not_doing_harm_not_a_government_priority/,75.0,1419978215.0,"**TL;DR**: If the purpose of government is to more efficiently solve large problems and create potential for a more prosperous, harmonious society, then isn't any law or government action that harms or disadvantages the average person antithetical to a government's role? Aren't any potential advantages or benefits of such an action invalidated for this reason? Why is exclusively beneficial effort with the mindfulness of serving society not priority for all organized government? 

***

I think we can, and should, debate widely on what authority and power government is allowed to have over citizens.  There are certainly some rifts between political parties that are subjective and opinion-based, and diplomatic argument is a great place to work those problem out.  

But why is government initiated distress of any human being, domestic or otherwise, taken as an unquestioned privilege of the government? A government's job, at its core, is bureaucratic in nature, is it not?  Why is any legitimate government allowed to make any decision that will result in a victim?  

I'm of course talking about large controversial issues, like the torture and experimentation reports of the CIA, behaviors and attitudes of prominent figures in law enforcement and the effects that's had on law enforcement officers, and the loss of individual rights in a national ""security"" focused mentality. But this also spills into many aspects of government reach. 

--Laws passed concerning civil rights, where someone is denied privileges based on a group they were born into; 

--laws banning controlled substances that do no harm in and of themselves, yet result in punishment that has been demonstrated to cause significant distress for individuals and their communities; 

--policies that allow business to be regulated in such a manner that is strongly beneficial for the business and those who profit from the business, yet is damaging for the consumer;

--unfair and/or illogical distribution of taxes;  

--""taken for granted"" institutions like the prison system (instead of education and recovery systems), violent war (instead of diplomatic or evasive/avoidance systems), and revenue/quota based motivations for police forces

I think arguments can also be made that a government has a responsibility to do no harm to the surrounding environment.  I think this can be taken to an illogical extreme, but there should be significant mindfulness to institutionalized large scale efforts that harm other species and ecosystems.  

I know many progressives and libertarians might share this view with me, but I would like to question why this is a party issue.  I feel that any human being regardless of political affiliation should feel similarly, simply as a result of being a person with empathy and rationality.  A government's job should be to organize the affairs of the country to benefit as many people as possible. 

We have government in the first place so that large populations can work towards common interests and achieve a more prosperous society.  If the average individual is worse off being governed than they would have been in a small, tribal kind of society, then government stops being progress for a culture.  Logically, shouldn't the government be exclusively working towards goals that further the interests of the average individual? 

Any law or government action that takes away from prosperity of the average citizen (or anyone else) would invalidate any possible  beneficial outcome.  Why is any government permitted to pass these sorts of laws and engage in these sorts of actions?  Is anything less not a human rights violation?  

Shouldn't doing no foreseen harm be an absolutely unwavering priority for any effective government?

The argument can definitely be made that government spying is getting out of hand, and is almost always inexcusable when it's on American citizens.  I'm also pretty critical of corporate lobbying, perpetual conflict in the middle east, gerrymandering, and what appears to be a steady militarization of our police force. I think I've been allowing myself to get cynical about the nature of the country as a whole.  

I still think that the US congress is all but bought and paid for, and that the transgressions of various government agencies is out of control and needs to be accounted for.  But taking a step back, I think I have reason to be optimistic.  

As a whole, I don't think the US government is anymore totalitarian than it has ever been in the past.  I think the recent boom in technology, and every citizen being able to have a internet capable, gps-enabled, mic and camera embedded device on them at all times has allowed intelligence agencies to expand their reach as far as they can.  But technology is a two way street.  While the CIA might be able to absorb petabytes of metadata on citizens, citizens are also able to leak government information and inform the public.  Every US citizen having access to the internet has allowed information to flow more freely in both directions, which leads to awareness, which can lead to reform.  

I think we've seen a slow and steady increase in human rights in the states.  When the founding fathers drafted ""all men are created equal,"" they were talking about property-owning, white adult men.  We've slowly given equal legal rights to all races and both genders.  The conversation about who gets rights keeps shifting in favor of humanity.  People fought against interracial marriage, it was (of course) ruled unconstitutional.  People now fight against same gender marriage, and now *that* is all but ruled unconstitutional.  

I think the millennials are going to be a major force for reform.  They were brought up to view all humans as equally worthy of fair and ethical treatment.  They were brought up to think of themselves as unique, special, and capable of doing anything they set their mind to.  Now that millennials are graduating college/high school and beyond, they're realizing that discrepancy between what they were told is the reality about our country, and how people are actually being treated, and they're outraged.  

I don't think the country is getting worse, I think citizens are finally realizing they're not getting what they were promised, and are starting to hold the government responsible.  I think times are going to get darker before they get brighter, but I'm quite optimistic about what our populas can accomplish in the future.

By Serj Tankian

The brutal attacks/bombings this week in New York, and Washington D.C., along with threats of attacks there and elsewhere in the country have changed our times forever. While the mass media concentrates on the details of the destruction, and the blanketed words of politicians, I will attempt to understand and explain the events from the fence. BOMBING AND BEING BOMBED ARE THE SAME THINGS ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE FENCE.

Terror is not a spontaneous human action without credence. People just dont hijack planes and commit harikari (suicide) without any weight of thought to the action. No one in the media seems to ask WHY DID THESE PEOPLE DO THIS HORRIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION?

To be able to understand the answer to this, we must first look at our U.S. Mideast Policy. During most of the 20th century, U.S. businesses have worked on attaining oil rights and concessions from countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. After WWI, secret back door deals by our State Dept. yielded oil rights from then defeated Turkey to fields in what is now Iraq and Saudi Arabia, in return for looking the other way at a crime against humanity, the Genocide of the Armenians by the Turks. Oil profits have been the motivating factors behind many attempts at counterinsurgency of democratic regimes by the CIA and the U.S in the Middle East (such as Iran in the 1950s, where the Shah replaced the Prime Minister who refused to give up oil rights to the U.S., and since the people couldnt deal with the Shah, an extremist government headed by the Ayatollah Khomeini ultimately prevailed). During the Iran-Iraq war, America supplied both sides with weapons and advice. These are not the actions of a rich superpower wanting peace. Lets not forget that Saddam Hussein, before being Americas vision of the Anti-Christ, was a close ally of the U.S., and the CIA. So what was the firm belief system of consecutive American administrations that caused all this to occur ? PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL LEAD TO HIGHER OIL AND GASOLINE PRICES. Lets not also forget the power of the Arms industry, disguised as defense, that still sells billions of dollars of weapons to the area. Therefore it has not been in the short-term economic interest of the U.S. to foster Peace in the Middle East. Using the above reasoning, the U.S. has encouraged extremist governments, toppled democracies, as in the case of Iran to replace it with a monarchy, rigged elections, and many more unspeakable political crimes for U.S. businesses abroad. Lets not also forget the Red Scare. During the war between the then Soviet Union and Afghanistan, the U.S. armed and supported the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim organization, and allowed them to export opium and heroin out of their country to pay for those weapons. Therefore the Taliban rose to power and control with the help of the U.S.A. Today, the bombing of Iraq still continues, no longer covered by the media, the economic embargo still remains, killing millions of children, and recently, while the world and the U.N. General Assembly have cried out to bring in peacekeeping forces into Israel and Palestine, to end the escalated war and recent assassinations, the U.S. has vetoed the rest of the Security Council and has halted the possibility of peace, there, in the most volatile place in the world.

People in Serbia, Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan to name a few have seen bombs fall, not always at military targets and kill innocent civilians, as the scene in New York city yesterday. The wars waged by our government in our names has landed smack in the middle of our living room. The half hour of destruction closed down all world financial markets, struck the central headquarters of our military, and had our leaders running into bunkers, and our citizens into fear and frenzy. What scares me more than what has occurred is what our reactions to the occurrences may cause. President Bush belongs to a long generation of Republican Presidents who love war economies. The media has only concentrated on the bombings, if you will, and what type of retaliations are looming for the perpetrators. What everyone fails to realize is that the bombings are a reaction to existing injustices around the world, generally unseen to most Americans. To react to a reaction would be to further sponsor the reaction. In other words, my belief is that the terror will multiply if concrete steps are not taken to sponsor peace in the middle east, NOW. This does not mean that we should not find the guilty party(s), Bin Laden, or whoever they may be, and not try them. Put simply, as long as a major injustice remains, violence precipitates to the surface of life.

Native American folklore, the Bible, Nostradamus, and many other major religious beliefs point to this era with the visuals of yesterdays disasters, and conditions of ecological disasters we experience daily in our lives today. War, rumors of war, famine, long burning fires, etc., are at our doorstep. We can prevail over this possible vision with the power of the human spirit, understanding, compassion, and peace. ITS TIME TO PUT OUR NEEDS FOR SECURITY AND SURVIVAL, ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH PEACE, ABOVE AND BEYOND PROFITS, ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES.

SOLUTION:

The U.S. should stop sidestepping the U.N. Security Council, and allow U.N. Peacekeeping troops and missions to the Middle East. Stop the violence first.

Stop the bombing and patrol of Iraq.

With todays gains in the use of alternative fuels, develop them to full usage with autos and other utilities, to make the country less dependant on an already depleting natural reserve, oil.

By initiating peace, we would have already shaken the foundations of support for Bin Laden, and/or all those that sponsor activities like those we saw yesterday, and break the stronghold of extremists on the world of Islam. On the other hand, if we carry out bombings on Afghanistan or elsewhere to appease public demand, and very likely kill innocent civilians along the way, wed be creating many more martyrs going to their deaths in retaliation against the retaliation. As shown from yesterdays events, you cannot stop a person whos ready to die.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

How does this apply to our current foreign policy and military attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria?,8.0,2p0xm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2p0xm7/has_any_new_evidence_come_to_light_on_enhanced/,4.0,1418341912.0,"Here is a link to an article about the new senate report, if you hadn't seen it yet:
http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/cia-torture-report-113420.html

>Senate report: CIA misled public, Bush on use of torture

>A long-awaited Senate report concludes that the CIA repeatedly misled the public, Congress and the White House about the agency’s aggressive questioning of detainees — including waterboarding, confinement in small spaces and shackling in stress positions — after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, minimizing the severity of the interrogations and exaggerating the usefulness of the information produced, including its role in setting in motion the U.S. raid that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

....

>Brennan insisted that information obtained through the program headed off deadly terrorist attacks and he rejected the idea that the CIA deliberately covered up its actions.
“Our review indicates that interrogations of detainees on whom EITs were used did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives. The intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of al-Qa’ida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,” the director said. “While we made mistakes, the record does not support the study’s inference that the Agency systematically and intentionally misled each of these audiences on the effectiveness of the program.”

And the Director of the CIA gave a press conference today, continuing to refute the claims that enhanced interrogation did not yeild information as states in that report this morning:
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/politics/cia-director-brennan-torture-report.html

>“There was very valuable intelligence obtained from individuals who had been, at some point, subjected to E.I.T.'s,” Mr. Brennan said.

And here is one of my favorite examples of the facts being loosely represented and interpreted in an article discussing comments from the previous CIA director:

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/panetta-enhanced-interrogation-did-not-lead-to-bin-laden/

>Panetta: Enhanced interrogation did not lead to bin Laden

>Panetta went on to say that there was at least some truth to the notion that enhanced interrogation was part of the hunt for bin Laden.

Does anyone else think that the article title and 4th paragraph seem to be at odds?

It goes on:

>""Yes, some of it came from some of the tactics that were used at that time, interrogation tactics that were used,"" he admitted. ""But the fact is we put together most of that intelligence without having to resort to that.""

>NBC's Chuck Todd followed up: ""And you think you could have gotten it without any?""

>Panetta replied: ""I think we could have gotten bin Laden without that.""

Thinking we could have gotten him without that information does not mean that the information gathered did not help lead to Bin Laden... But is this just a semantic argument, or is it a factual one?

To me - this doesn't really seem to be a revelation of facts, but just a re-hash of divisions after an election and a diversion from the very real and ongoing military actions against ISIS and AQ in Syria and Iraq.

Am I missing specifics that have only just come to light? How does all of this help the US in the continuing fight against terrorism, and how does that conclusion apply to our current foreign policy? Are any ISIS prisoners being taken? Have any been taken in the last 4 years? Were any taken in Libya in 2011 or since? Are they being interrogated?",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

But lets look back to May this year when chemical weapons were used and the US accused Assad. [The finding of the UN were that it was in fact the Syrian rebels who were responsible!](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10039672/UN-accuses-Syrian-rebels-of-chemical-weapons-use.html) Did the west impose sanctions on them or condemn them? No.

Additionally if the US cared about human rights, [why would they stand back and let Saddam use them against Iran in 1988?](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/25/secret_cia_files_prove_america_helped_saddam_as_he_gassed_iran) Because They have an agenda in the middle east!

>[On 16 June 2006 the defence ministers of Iran and Syria signed an agreement for military cooperation against what they called the ""common threats"" presented by Israel and the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Syria_relations)

America has far from hid it's resentment of Iran and it once again comes down to oil. Iran, like Iraq and Libya (the latter two both seeing US military intervention) has changed the currency it trades oil in from the US dollar. In 2000 Iraq began to trade oil in euros, but after the US gained control it was promptly switched back to dollars despite the fact that due to exchange rates at the time this would mean a 15-20% loss to Iraq. Similarly in Libya Gaddafi was in the process of setting up a new gold currency in a block African countries called the Dinar, which they planned to replace the dollar with in oil trading.

Mark my words the US will inevitably begin military action against Syria whether they are backed by the UN or not.

In 2012, Huntsman was by far the best candidate to go up against Obama and take Independents away from him. Great foreign policy credentials being ambassador to Singapore and China, twice elected the Governor of Utah, and he worked in the Reagan administration. 

2008 doesn't matter since the Democrats could have ran a block of wood and still won. Palin however was a terrible VP choice

In 2000, McCain was obviously the more serious and respectable candidate. Bush was aided by Karl Rove who relentlessly and horribly attacked McCain. Bush ended up winning, but Gore received more votes. I think McCain would have beat Gore in both categories.

In 1996, they nominate Bob Dole against the young and charismatic Clinton and he got beat handedly.

I'd argue that the last good choice of a nomination by the GOP was H.W. Bush in 1988, with him being the VP of a popular administration who had previously been a congressman and the director of the CIA

And this year it looks to me like the GOP is going to nominate Rubio, a Senator who barely has any more experience than Obama had in 2008 and has accomplished nothing in the Senate, and who was actually called on to resign. Meanwhile you have Kasich, a former congressman who helped to balance the budget in a bipartisan way with Clinton and who was on the armed services committee and is a popular governor of Ohio, a state that Republicans have to win

>The existence of a revolutionary socialist government with growing  ties to the Soviet Union only 90 miles away, insisted the United States  Government, was a situation which no self-respecting superpower should  tolerate, and in 1961 it undertook an invasion of Cuba.  
>  
>But less than 50 miles from the Soviet Union sat Pakistan, a close  ally of the United States, a member since 1955 of the South-East Asia  Treaty Organization (SEATO), the US-created anti-communist alliance.  On  the very border of the Soviet Union was Iran, an even closer ally of  the United States, with its relentless electronic listening posts,  aerial surveillance, and infiltration into Russian territory by American  agents. And alongside Iran, also bordering the Soviet Union, was  Turkey, a member of the Russians’ mortal enemy, NATO, since 1951.  
>  
>In 1962 during the “Cuban Missile Crisis”, Washington, seemingly in a  state of near-panic, informed the world that the Russians were  installing “offensive” missiles in Cuba.  The US promptly instituted a  “quarantine” of the island – a powerful show of naval and marine forces  in the Caribbean would stop and search all vessels heading towards Cuba;  any found to contain military cargo would be forced to turn back.  
>  
>The United States, however, had missiles and bomber bases already in  place in Turkey and other missiles in Western Europe pointed toward the  Soviet Union.  Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev later wrote:  
>  
>The Americans had surrounded our country with military bases and  threatened us with nuclear weapons, and now they would learn just what  it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you; we’d be doing  nothing more than giving them a little of their own medicine. … After  all, the United States had no moral or legal quarrel with us. We hadn’t  given the Cubans anything more than the Americans were giving to their  allies. We had the same rights and opportunities as the Americans. Our  conduct in the international arena was governed by the same rules and  limits as the Americans.

>Lest anyone misunderstand, as Khrushchev apparently did, the rules under which Washington was operating, *Time*  magazine was quick to explain.  ”On the part of the Communists,” the  magazine declared, “this equating \[referring to Khrushchev’s offer to  mutually remove missiles and bombers from Cuba and Turkey\] had obvious  tactical motives.  On the part of neutralists and pacifists \[who  welcomed Khrushchev’s offer\] it betrayed intellectual and moral  confusion.”  The confusion lay, it seems, in not seeing clearly who were  the good guys and who were the bad guys, for “The purpose of the U.S.  bases \[in Turkey\] was not to blackmail Russia but to strengthen the  defense system of NATO, which had been created as a safeguard against  Russian aggression. As a member of NATO, Turkey welcomed the bases as a  contribution to her own defense.”  Cuba, which had been invaded only the  year before, could have, it seems, no such concern.  Time continued its  sermon: Beyond these differences between the two cases, there is an  enormous moral difference between U.S. and Russian objectives … To  equate U.S. and Russian bases is in effect to equate U.S. and Russian  purposes … The U.S. bases, such as those in Turkey, have helped keep the  peace since World War II, while the Russian bases in Cuba threatened to  upset the peace. The Russian bases were intended to further conquest  and domination, while U.S. bases were erected to preserve freedom. The  difference should have been obvious to all.

>Equally obvious was the right of the United States to maintain a  military base on Cuban soil – Guantánamo Naval Base by name, a vestige  of colonialism staring down the throats of the Cuban people, which the  US, to this day, refuses to vacate despite the vehement protest of the  Castro government.  
>  
>After the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, we learned that there are  also good and bad hijackings.  On several occasions Cuban planes and  boats were hijacked to the United States but they were not returned to  Cuba, nor were the hijackers punished.  Instead, some of the planes and  boats were seized by US authorities for non-payment of debts claimed by  American firms against the Cuban government.     But then there were the bad hijackings – planes forced to fly from the  United States to Cuba.  When there began to be more of these than  flights in the opposite direction, Washington was obliged to reconsider  its policy.  
>  
>It appears that there are as well good and bad terrorists. When the  Israelis bombed PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985, Ronald Reagan  expressed his approval.  The president asserted that nations have the  right to retaliate against terrorist attacks “as long as you pick out  the people responsible”.     
>  
>But if Cuba had dropped bombs on any of the headquarters of the  anti-Castro exiles in Miami or New Jersey, Ronald Reagan would likely  have gone to war, though for 25 years the Castro government had been on  the receiving end of an extraordinary series of terrorist attacks  carried out in Cuba, in the United States, and in other countries by the  exiles and their CIA mentors.  (We shall not discuss the consequences  of Cuba bombing CIA headquarters.)

>Bombing and strafing attacks of Cuba by planes based in the United States began in October 1959, if not before.      In early 1960, there were several fire-bomb air raids on Cuban cane  fields and sugar mills, in which American pilots also took part – at  least three of whom died in crashes, while two others were captured.   The State Department acknowledged that one plane which crashed, killing  two Americans, had taken off from Florida, but insisted that it was  against the wishes of the US government.     
>  
>In March a French freighter unloading munitions from Belgium exploded  in Havana taking 75 lives and injuring 200, some of whom subsequently  died.  The United States denied Cuba’s accusation of sabotage but  admitted that it had sought to prevent the shipment.     
>  
>And so it went … reaching a high point in April of the following year  in the infamous CIA-organized invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. Over  100 exiles died in the attack.  Close to 1,200 others were taken  prisoner by the Cubans.  It was later revealed that four American pilots  flying for the CIA had lost their lives as well.     
>  
>Despite the fact that the Kennedy administration was acutely  embarrassed by the unmitigated defeat – indeed, because of it – a  campaign of smaller-scale attacks upon Cuba was initiated almost  immediately, under the rubric of Operation Mongoose.   Throughout the  1960s, the Caribbean island was subjected to  countless sea and air  commando raids by exiles, at times  accompanied by their CIA  supervisors, inflicting damage upon oil refineries, chemical plants and  railroad bridges, cane fields, sugar mills and sugar warehouses;  infiltrating spies, saboteurs and assassins … anything to damage the  Cuban economy, promote disaffection, or make the revolution look bad …  taking the lives of Cuban militia members and others in the process …   pirate attacks on Cuban fishing boats and merchant ships, bombardments  of Soviet vessels docked in Cuba, an assault upon a Soviet army camp  with 12 Russian soldiers reported wounded … a hotel and a theatre  shelled from offshore because Russians and East Europeans were supposed  to be present there …     
>  
>These actions were not always carried out on the direct order of the  CIA or with its foreknowledge, but the Agency could hardly plead “rogue  elephant”.  It had created Operation Mongoose headquarters in Miami that  was truly a state within a city – over, above, and outside the laws of  the United States, not to mention international law, with a staff of  several hundred Americans directing many more Cuban agents in just such  types of actions, with a budget in excess of $50 million a year, and an  arrangement with the local press to keep operations in Florida secret  except when the CIA wanted something publicized.     
>  
>Title 18 of the US Code declares it to be a crime to launch a  “military or naval expedition or enterprise” from the United States  against a country with which the United States is not (officially) at  war. Although US authorities now and then aborted an exile plot or  impounded a boat – sometimes because the Coast Guard or other officials  had not been properly clued in – no Cubans were prosecuted under this  act.  This was no more than to be expected inasmuch as Attorney General  Robert Kennedy had determined after the Bay of Pigs that the invasion  did not constitute a military expedition.     
>  
>The commando raids were combined with a total US trade and credit  embargo, which continues to this day, and which genuinely hurt the Cuban  economy and chipped away at the society’s standard of living. So  unyielding has the embargo been that when Cuba was hard hit by a  hurricane in October 1963, and Casa Cuba, a New York social club, raised  a large quantity of clothing for relief, the United States refused to  grant it an export license on the grounds that such shipment was  “contrary to the national interest”.     
>  
>Moreover, pressure was brought to bear upon other countries to  conform to the embargo, and goods destined for Cuba were sabotaged:  machinery damaged, chemicals added to lubricating fluids to cause rapid  wear on diesel engines, a manufacturer in West Germany paid to produce  ball-bearings off-center, another to do the same with balanced wheel  gears – “You’re talking about big money,” said a CIA officer involved in  the sabotage efforts, “when you ask a manufacturer to go along with you  on that kind of project because he has to reset his whole mold.  And he  is probably going to worry about the effect on future business.  You  might have to pay him several hundred thousand dollars or more.”     
>  
>One manufacturer who defied the embargo was the British Leyland  Company, which sold a large number of buses to Cuba in 1964. Repeated  expressions of criticism and protest by Washington officials and  Congressmen failed to stem deliveries of some of the buses.  Then, in  October, an East German cargo ship carrying another 42 buses to Cuba  collided in thick fog with a Japanese vessel in the Thames. The Japanese  ship was able to continue on, but the cargo ship was beached on its  side; the buses would have to be “written off”, said the Leyland  company.  In the leading British newspapers it was just an accident  story.     In the *New York Times*  it was not even reported. A decade was to pass before the American  columnist Jack Anderson disclosed that his CIA and National Security  Agency sources had confirmed that the collision had been arranged by the  CIA with the cooperation of British intelligence.      Subsequently, another CIA officer stated that he was skeptical about  the collision story, although admitting that “it is true that we were  sabotaging the Leyland buses going to Cuba from England, and that was  pretty sensitive business.”     
>  
>What undoubtedly was an even more sensitive venture was the use of  chemical and biological weapons against Cuba by the United States. It is  a remarkable record.  
>  
>a Canadian agricultural technician working as an  adviser to the Cuban government was paid $5,000 by “an American military  intelligence agent” to infect Cuban turkeys with a virus which would  produce the fatal Newcastle disease.  Subsequently, 8,000 turkeys died.   The technician later claimed that although he had been to the farm  where the turkeys had died, he had not actually administered the virus,  but had instead pocketed the money, and that the turkeys had died from  neglect and other causes unrelated to the virus.  This may have been a  self-serving statement.  The Washington Post reported that “According to  U.S. intelligence reports, the Cubans – and some Americans – believe  the turkeys died as the result of espionage.”     
>  
>In 1971, also according to participants, the CIA turned over to Cuban  exiles a virus which causes African swine fever.  Six weeks later, an  outbreak of the disease in Cuba forced the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to  prevent a nationwide animal epidemic.  The outbreak, the first ever in  the Western hemisphere, was called the “most alarming event” of the year  by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.     
>  
>Ten years later, the target may well have been human beings, as an  epidemic of dengue fever swept the Cuban island.  Transmitted by  blood-eating insects, usually mosquitos, the disease produces severe flu  symptoms and incapacitating bone pain.  Between May and October 1981,  over 300,000 cases were reported in Cuba with 158 fatalities, 101 of  which were children under 15.      In 1956 and 1958, declassified documents have revealed, the US Army  loosed swarms of specially bred mosquitos in Georgia and Florida to see  whether disease-carrying insects could be weapons in a biological war.   The mosquitos bred for the tests were of the Aedes Aegypti type, the  precise carrier of dengue fever as well as other diseases.     In 1967 it was reported by *Science*  magazine that at the US government center in Fort Detrick, Maryland,  dengue fever was amongst those “diseases that are at least the objects  of considerable research and that appear to be among those regarded as  potential BW \[biological warfare\] agents.”  
>  
>The ingenuity which went into the chemical and biological warfare  against Cuba was apparent in some of the dozens of plans to assassinate  or humiliate Fidel Castro. Devised by the CIA or Cuban exiles, with the  cooperation of American mafiosi, the plans ranged from poisoning  Castro’s cigars and food to a chemical designed to make his hair and  beard fall off and LSD to be administered just before a public speech.  There were also of course the more traditional approaches of gun and  bomb, one being an attempt to drop bombs on a baseball stadium while  Castro was speaking; the B-26 bomber was driven away by anti-aircraft  fire before it could reach the stadium.     It is a combination of such Cuban security measures, informers,  incompetence, and luck which has served to keep the bearded one alive to  the present day.  
>  
>Attempts were also made on the lives of Castro’s brother Raul and Che  Guevara.  The latter was the target of a bazooka fired at the United  Nations building in New York in December 1964.      Various Cuban exile groups have engaged in violence on a regular  basis in the United States with relative impunity for decades.  One of  them, going by the name of Omega 7 and headquartered in Union City, New  Jersey, was characterized by the FBI in 1980 as “the most dangerous  terrorist organization in the United States”. Attacks against Cuba itself began to lessen around the end of the  1960s, due probably to a lack of satisfying results combined with ageing  warriors, and exile groups turned to targets in the United States and  elsewhere in the world.  
>  
>During the next decade, while the CIA continued to pour money into  the exile community, more than 100 serious “incidents” took place in the  United States for which Omega 7 and other groups claimed  responsibility.  (Within the community, the distinction between a  terrorist and a non-terrorist group is not especially precise; there is  much overlapping identity and frequent creation of new names.) There  occurred repeated bombings of the Soviet UN Mission, its Washington  embassy, its automobiles, a Soviet ship docked in New Jersey, the  offices of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, with a number of American  policemen and Russians injured in these attacks; several bombings of the   Cuban UN Mission and its Interests Section in Washington, many attacks  upon Cuban diplomats, including at least one murder; a bomb discovered  at New York’s Academy of Music in 1976 shortly  before a celebration of  the Cuban Revolution was to begin; a  bombing two years later of the  Lincoln Center after the Cuban ballet had performed; three bombings in a  single night in 1979:  the office of a New Jersey Cuban refugee  program, a New Jersey pharmacy that sent medical supplies to Cuba, and a  suitcase that exploded at JFK Airport, injuring four luggage handlers,  minutes before it was to be placed aboard a TWA flight to Los Angeles.     
>  
>The single most violent act of this period was the blowing up of a  Cubana Airlines plane shortly after it took off from Barbados on 6  October 1976, which took the lives of 73 people including the entire  Cuban championship fencing team.  CIA documents later revealed that on  22 June, a CIA officer abroad had cabled a report to Agency headquarters  that he had learned from a source that a Cuban exile group planned to  bomb a Cubana airliner flying between Panama and Havana.  The group’s  leader was a baby doctor named Orlando Bosch.  After the plane crashed  in the sea in October, it was Bosch’s network of exiles that claimed  responsibility.  The cable showed that the CIA had the means to  penetrate the Bosch organization, but there’s no indication in any of  the documents that the Agency undertook any special monitoring of Bosch  and his group because of their plans, or that the CIA warned Havana.     
>  
>In 1983, while Orlando Bosch sat in a Venezuelan prison charged with  masterminding the plane bombing, the City Commission of Miami proclaimed  a “Dr. Orlando Bosch Day"". In 1968, Bosch had been convicted of a bazooka attack on a Polish ship in Miami.  
>  
>Although there has always been the extreme lunatic fringe in the  Cuban exile community (as opposed to the normal lunatic fringe)  insisting that Washington has sold out their cause, over the years there  has been only the occasional arrest and conviction of an exile for a  terrorist attack in the United States, so occasional that the exiles can  only assume that Washington’s heart is not wholly in it.  The exile  groups and their key members are well known to the authorities, for the  anti-Castroites have not excessively shied away from publicity.  At  least as late as the early 1980s, they were training openly in southern  Florida and southern California; pictures of them flaunting their  weapons appeared in the press.     The CIA, with its countless contacts-cum-informers amongst the exiles,  could fill in many of the missing pieces for the FBI and the police, if  it wished to.  In 1980, in a detailed report on Cuban-exile terrorism, *The Village Voice* of New York reported:  
>  
>Two stories were squeezed out of New York police officials … “You  know, it’s funny,” said one cautiously, “there have been one or two  things … but let’s put it this way. You get just so far on a case and  suddenly the dust is blown away. Case closed. You ask the CIA to help,  and they say they aren’t really interested. You get the message.”  Another investigator said he was working on a narcotics case involving  Cuban exiles a couple of years ago, and telephone records he obtained  showed a frequently dialed number in Miami. He said he traced the number  to a company called Zodiac, “which turned out to be a CIA front.” He  dropped his investigation.     
>  
>The Cuban exiles in the United States, collectively, may well constitute the longest lasting and most prolific terrorist group in the  world.  It is thus the height of irony, not to mention hypocrisy, that  for many years up to the present time in the 1990s, the State Department  has included Cuba amongst those nations that “sponsor terrorism”, not  because of any terrorist acts committed by the Cuban government, but  solely because they “harbor terrorists”.

tl;dr the USA acted like hypocrites during the Cuban Missile Crisis, has sponsored multiple terrorist groups against Cuba, attempted an illegal invasion in 1961, blocked charity to Cuba, sunk a British ship violating the Cuban embargo and carried out a campaign of chemical and biological warfare against Cuba...

73,Failure From the Top Down; the Snowden Chronicles,5.0,1g2fsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1g2fsj/failure_from_the_top_down_the_snowden_chronicles/,4.0,1370895216.0,"The recently revealed data gathering on the part of the US government is the culmination of failures at nearly every level of our society, save the individual, which finds its expression in Edward Snowden.

According to Rep. Peter King, he is “dangerous to the country”, but in reality this guy isn't the problem, or a danger for that matter. If nothing, this man is a patriot. While I am not defending his actions outright; I have too little information to do that, his exposure to this program is certainly now at an end, and all the “danger” he poses now is as a spokesperson or a martyr. Care should be exercised, regardless of his level of deviation from the law, that he remain (and be encouraged to be) the former rather than become the latter. His actions, illegal though they are, fall well within the lines of civil disobedience exercised with reason and prudent consideration of the consequences not for himself, but for the nation. Knowledge that this program exists simply does not need to be Top Secret. Do you really think that anyone trying to hide their associations isn't cloning telephones and routing data through false IPs?

If Mr. Snowden wished to be a danger, he would have disclosed details of the program, not the program's existence itself.

From the top down, the US Government has failed its citizenry in the FBI's request to the FISC on behalf of the NSA. Whether or not you support the Patriot Act, it has been both passed and renewed by our elected representatives. The care with which it should be applied has evidently not been monitored, and so we have an indication, as many privacy advocated have accused, that the law is more porous than it ought to be if a court would permit an interpretation as egregious as this.

Not realizing that a patriotic citizen might perform this act of civil disobedience underpins the truly horrific nature of this order and the system that begot it. Truly, the litmus test for whether a government should ever exercise its authority in a covert manner is whether a breach of this sort might transpire through the acts of one of its loyal citizens.

Failure!

That our elected representatives on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including the slightly more noble Sens. Wyden and Udall, were unwilling to be whistle blowers themselves illustrates a moral failing in our elected representatives. Certainly, if a US Senator feels the need to “hint” at something he shouldn't be hinting at, then he should know that he ought not be circumspect. As a citizen patriot sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution, he should know that the Patriot Act is just an Act, and that the overriding precept of the Constitution is that it “outranks” mere laws, even the important ones. What's more, I hardly expect a rogue Senator to carry the same level of risk at disclosure than Mr. Snowden.

When it comes down to it, had a sitting Senator blown a whistle, I find it hard to believe that he would end up in the stockades. Rather, the debate would be elevated and the political will of the people would surely have defended him in a way that I'm not quite sure it will for Mr. Snowden. Our politicians are risk-averse when it comes to advocating for the citizenry, as a result of our politics and the introverted nature of the political world, and it has left our Constitution woefully undefended.

Failure!

That Mr. Snowden was not a US Government employee, but instead worked for the private consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton, signals yet another layer of failure. The outsourcing of work so deeply entrenched in our national security interests that it causes such an uproar upon its disclosure is simply unacceptable by any reasonable definition of discretion. Outsourcing to private companies, let alone one held by a globally interested Private Equity [Carlyle] firm, many of whose interests are capitally rather than patriotically oriented, is the pinnacle of poor decision making in an intelligence  field where controlling information is the bellwether by which performance can be measured.

Failure!

The screening process that permitted Mr. Snowden, a presumably honorably discharged, yet, in the formal sense, woefully uneducated individual, to access this information, must also be called into question. Clearance is administered by the Federal Government, and this process must either be considered wholly effective, in which case this breach signals Mr. Snowden's patriotism, or defective because it permitted someone who clearly embraces a worldview that values freedom over government to pursue this course of action.

Failure!

No executive at Verizon, and certainly not the team of executives, stood up and refused this order. To any reasonable person of merit, this order signals something deeply wrong with the execution of the law by which it derives its interpretation. At worst, it constitutes literally hundreds of millions of unconstitutional searches.

Think about it this way: would the FBI been able to obtain any warrants to search a citizen's house for their phone bill to obtain this same information without cause? Scale matters here, and the fact that more than one entity (Verizon and the customer) has access to this data does not mean that obtaining a warrant pell-mell for the information is any more constitutional than the IRS receiving daily updates of every individual's bank accounts in order to detect tax fraud. The IRS does get reports on the big transactions, but it is the banks that provide it, as it should be here with Verizon*.

Verizon's executives had neither the interests nor the courage to propel them to simply not comply. Complicity is the enemy of reason, and the number of scenarios by which this order could have been alluded to publicly. No disclosure of the order need have been made, simply a lack of compliance and let the chips fall where they may. After all, is the government going to sue Verizon out of business, stranding the American people who are its shareholders to destitution for that part of their portfolios?

Failure!

Mr. Snowden, finally, didn't tell his family, as far as we know, that he was about to do what he's done. Presumably, that was not to worry them. I can't help but think, though, that his mother's response would have been eerily close to that of my own mother's. That he should come to his senses, keep his head down, not ruin his life, and that others know better than he. In point of fact, families love each other and when a member is exposed to the threat of reprisal, this response is normal and healthy.

At the same time, this response that I have assigned the poor Mrs. Snowden (apologies, my dear), and the act of protection (for even a day) that her son most likely performed, indicates that our families are failing. There was a time, generations distant for the most part, where nearly every mother, despite her love and fears, proudly sent her sons off to war to defend our Great Nation. That Mr. Snowden presumably could not count on that same encouragement, from family, friends, and community to quite literally risk his life in the service of his nation, is a sad thing. On this last point, only, do I hope I'm gravely mistaken.

*In a marginally related sidenote: Why was there no protocol set up to query specific data from this database while creating a simple, one to one encrypted hash for personal information and GPS data? The NSA and CIA have exceptionally gifted cryptographers and statisticians who certainly have the ability to cull meaningful information from anonymous data with the same rigor, sophistication, and alacrity whether or not they can see specific data. A hash could have been created, sent to Verizon, and the data transmitted back could have been fully analyzed and queried through the hash to Verizon's database to deliver real-time, meaningful information. If I can think of it, they surely can, and if the judge ruling on this order could not, or did not consider this as a better alternative, then the failure gains yet another layer.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

These DVDs were mailed to many people across the nation. It's pretty ridiculous. Basically, it's a bunch of conspiracy theory that Barrack Obama is a covert socialist hellbent on converting America to communism. (Never mind that those are two separate ideologies. That doesn't matter. They're the same exact thing if you don't care about details, or were educated during the Red Scare.)

It should be noted that everywhere on the cover that the term ""Real Father"" shows up, ""Real"" appears in red and is asterisked by a small Soviet Union Hammer and Sickle.

I knew I was in for a fun ride when the first thing that showed after pressing play was this:

 >""Director's Note: This film is based on actual events, interviews, and archives, as well as re-creations of probable events, using reasoned logic, and approximated conversations to provide a cohesive understanding of Obama's history.

 >Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true political foundations and his agenda for fundamentally transforming America?""

* 4) Marxism in Paradise
* 5) May 19th Communist College Years
* 6) Chicago's New Community Agitator
* 7) Harvard Law al-Mansour
* 8) ACORN'S Front Man in Chicagoland
* 9) Campaign for Radical Change
* 10) Socialist Dreams From Frank Marshall Davis

Basically, the tale reads as follows.

""Barrack Obama's *real* father was a card carrying member of the Communist Party of the United States, and was taking orders from the Soviets to spread the influence of communism through the black populace, and was apparently under FBI surveillance for a number of years. Obama's *real* father met Obama's mother in Hawaii, took some nude photos of her which he sold to magazines, and knocked her up. Obama's mother was in Hawaii because her father, Barrack's grandfather, was a CIA operative who was there to oversee the education of African immigrant students, one of whom was named Barrack Obama. If anyone found out that Obama's mother had had a child to a noted communist, Obama's grandfather would lose his security clearance. Also, Obama's *real* father already had a wife and children, and so did not want that being known to his circle of people either. So they arranged a marriage to the immigrant student from Kenya, Barrack Obama, to save face.

After being introduced to his *real* father at the age of twelve, young Barrack was indoctrinated into socialist extremism. 

Blah blah blah, socialist this, communist that, muslim the other thing, and Islam the bit over there.""

Throughout all of this, they've managed to tie him to everything from 9/11 (Yes, THAT 9/11) to the [ILWU strike in Hawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union#The_1934_West_Coast_Waterfront_strike) (Note the date on that one.) to ACORN voter registration fraud (Funny in light of recent developments with the GOP.), to the Weather Underground, through loose connections, out-of-context quotes, and shoddily crafted lines between random things. The director also manages to characterize Michelle Obama as being ""a bitter socialist extremist"" as well. It's basically the 2008 GOP  campaign rehashed, conspiracy style. They even make a few swipes at Hillary Clinton while they're at it.

It's hilariously terrible, until I wonder how many people have watched it and possibly believed this crap. Then I get sad.

I'm going to argue that, to the contrary, all credible evidence puts the blame directly at the feet of the Syrian government. I will lay out the case and also deal with common arguments I've read on this board. And I will leave out the declassified government dossier recently released by the US government, since many folks don't trust the CIA. This is lengthy, but hopefully its worth the read.

What We Know:

*The attack was in rebel occupied areas in Damascus, the capital city. [Source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Ghouta_attacks) 

*The attack was a nerve agent that independent tests have said has a Sarin-like signature. [Source](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/01/217855386/kerry-tests-indicate-sarin-used-in-syria)

*Assad's forces have Sarin and Sarin-like chemical weapons. They have the largest stockpile of such weapons in the Middle East. [Source](http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/080602_syrianwmd.pdf) [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction)

*Sarin requires special equipment and expertise to manufacture and load into a delivery vehicle. [Source](http://sc-ems.com/ems/NuclearBiologicalChemical/Sarin/sarin.htm)

*There were over a dozen rockets recovered consistent with delivering Sarin.

*Civilian dead and wounded had symptoms consistent with a Sarin-like attack. [Source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/22/dispatches-longest-short-walk-syria)

*The attack followed chemical warfare doctrine, which their military is almost certainly familiar with, given their possession of chemical weapons.

*Syria has been accused of at least two other attacks involving chemical weapons.

*Syria stonewalled efforts to investigate those two attacks. This stonewalling last months. The weapons inspectors were in Damascus to investigate those suspected attacks. [Source](http://www.newsdaily.com/article/1ae97c303715cd155e65d6a9bbf19753/un-chemical-weapons-inspectors-arrive-in-syria)

*Syria wouldn't allow inspectors access to the attack sites for 5 days.

*Syria has a history of wiping out civilians to fight uprisings, especially in this conflict. They have shown no respect for the lives of civilians.

*The Syrians followed the attack with intense shelling that lasted for days. The Syrian government is actively trying to take back this territory. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Ghouta_attacks) [Source](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57599654/syria-forces-keep-bombing-area-of-alleged-chemical-weapons-attack/)

*The only other forces in the region are the rebels. So your reasonable choices are to think it was Syria or the rebels. That's it.

So lets start by talking about the evidence that it was the rebels, since they are the only other reasonable force in the area to launch the attacks. I assert that speculation isn't evidence. Its only speculation. That's why I left it out of list of facts presented. When I say ""evidence"" or ""no evidence"" its shorthand for ""credible evidence"". By this I mean corroborated reporting from news media sources, not fringe blogs and single reporters making unverified claims. I think that's a fair standard.

There is no evidence that the rebels have the capacity to launch the attack. There is no evidence that they were in possession of Sarin. There is no evidence that they would kill over a thousand of their brethren to try and get the world more involved. There is only speculation that they might benefit from it (they might not). So if you think its the rebels, I'd like to see some evidence that they had the means and opportunity to carry out the attack. It doesn't matter if someone wants to do something if they don't have the capability to do it. 

Some have speculated that Assad would never commit this attack while the weapon's inspectors are in country. It doesn't make sense to them, they argue. First, I'd point out that all kinds of things are true that don't make sense to you. Further, this doesn't have to make sense to you for it to be true. You see this all the time if you ever watch a show like First 48, which follows police as they investigate murder. They often never know the motive, but demonstrate the case with means, opportunity, and guilty behavior, which the Assad regime has all three in spades. Think of it this way, if Assad use chemical weapons against sleeping civilians with the weapons inspectors in country, do you really expect the motive to make sense to a normal person like yourself? A nonsensical motive is clearly a good candidate when the behavior is this far outside your norm. I'd also point out that killing civilians just because they occupy an area he wants to take is his modus operandi. Its exactly what he has been doing for two years and shows no signs of stopping. The only new behavior is a new weapon.

But lets unpack this argument a bit more. Would he miscalculate to such an extreme? Assad miscalculated when the protests first began. The protestors didn't want him out, but had far more modest demands when they started. But Assad responded with a brutal and violent repression that changed the demands from reforms to demanding his departure from leadership. That's a big miscalculation. And when the rebellion grew in response to the crackdown, he escalated the violence, presumably thinking it would break the back of the opposition. Assad was wrong and that was another big miscalculation. He also thought the world would stand by and stay out of Syrian affairs. The world didn't. Countries began to provide material support to the opposition in response to his escalation. This was another big calculation, eerily similar to a miscalculation to use chemical weapons. 

We have a dictator that has been killing civilians for two years and thumbing his nose at the international community, and you really wonder if he is the kind of person that would miscalculate the world reaction and do something like this? Really?

Even if you want a motive, which isn't necessary to demonstrate the truth, its there and completely consistent with his past behavior.

Another argument is that the revels had the motive to do this as a false flag. Keep in mind that this isn't evidence. Its purely speculation. Remember, speculation isn't evidence. Its just speculation. So lets talk about what evidence you might need for this speculation to even make sense. You would need to demonstrate that the rebels have the means and opportunity to carry out the attack. There is no credible evidence of this. I've read the blogs and single reports from reporters no one has heard of. But that isn't credible or confirmed by multiple independent sources. There is no evidence they have nerve agent. There is no evidence they could store it. There is no evidence they could use it if they had it and could store it. There is no evidence that they have attacked a huge neighborhood like this and tried to blame it on Assad. Have seedier elements in the rebel factions killed civilians? Of course. But nothing even remotely close to this. There is evidence that they have vigorously defended neighborhoods like this one from attacks, including providing food, shelter, water and military defense from the Syrian army. An attack like this would be completely out of character for them. They also didn't act guilty in the aftermath. While Assad stonewalled for five days, they took to media and begged for an investigation. 

Now lets talk about where the Sarin-like weapons might come from, because it has to come from somewhere. It almost certainly comes from a state sponsor. Who would that be? Keep in mind, there is no evidence that anything like this came from anyone other than the Syrian regime. 

The US might do this, we are told. We have run false flag operations in the past. Sure, we have. But nothing like this. This would be unprecedented and out of character for us. You also have to assume that the CIA would not fear giving chemical weapons to terrorist factions within the rebel movement. That seems unreasonable to me.

What about some other country? Who? Saudi Arabia? For all the talk about the US being their bitch, if they are caught giving chemical weapons to terrorists and they use it against western targets, they are going to have a very bad day. The same is true for any other state. No one wants us to find out that bunch of dead civilians wiped out from nerve agent came from your government. No one.

But the evidence is entirely circumstantial, we are told. Its not direct evidence. Well [circumstantial evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence) is evidence. People are convicted every day based on only circumstantial evidence. When a perp leaves a fingerprint at the murder scene, that's circumstantial evidence. When his car is seen leaving the scene, that's circumstantial evidence. When you have enough corroborating evidence, you have a strong case. Timothy McVeigh was convicted entirely based on circumstantial evidence, for example. And what kind of direct evidence is even possible? Do you expect for someone in the regime to tell us that they did it? Do you expect an eye witness to the loading and using of a nerve agent to step forward and tell you they did it? Refusing to believe only such evidence means that you are essentially unable to be persuaded by available evidence. 

Another argument is that only if the UN sends a team of inspectors to figure out who did it will you accept the findings. Its probably no coincidence that the UN inspectors were only there to see if a chemical attack actually occurred. Its reasonable to assume that Assad wouldn't have let them in there with the goal of figuring out who actually did this. And Russia is likely to resist any attempts to pin this on Assad. Expecting the UN to be able to convince you is expecting something that likely can't even occur. 

In closing, I'll conclude with the court analogy. Several people have suggested that this wouldn't stand up in court. I disagree. Only two parties could have done this. And only evidence of one of them, the Assad regime, that had the means, opportunity, guilty behavior, prior behavior, and motive to carry out the attack.

Thanks for reading. Hope it sparks a discussion.

http://vimeo.com/72289514

It got me thinking that Obama must have been a part of huge plot considering his extreme about face on this issue. Do you think he really was a part of some sort of plot to swindle Americans into voting in a puppet or was he just after money and power of his own and didn't care who he had to whore himself out to to get it? Is it just the interests of his corporate donors forcing his hands and pulling the strings? Is he just privy to information American's aren't that make him believe these policies are all of the sudden really there to protect our rights not take them away?

I hate to say it but it almost seems like he has no control of his message, like he is being blackmailed or somehow manipulated. [Michelle at one point said being first lady felt like being a prisoner in a really nice prison](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/michelle-obama-prison-elements-being-first-lady-its-really-nice-prison_738542.html). I wonder how true this is. Could it be that institutions use coercive force to change the message of our elected president? JFK was the last president to really stand up and speak out against government secrecy. I can't help but be reminded of what happened to him and a number of his close family members. I fantasize and wonder if that is some sort of secret leverage used by the CIA. This is clearly wild speculation on my part and hopefully too sexy to be reality but this craziness makes me think anything is possible.

I think its pretty nuts that I think the way I do but secrecy seems to have gone way too far. Maybe I'm out of my mind crazy, but to me the government is crazier. I along with everyone else in this country must have no idea what is going on If we cannot elect someone who consistently speaks out against government violations of constitutional rights before being elected to president. Then once in office we get no results. We must be lost as a people. It seems like there is a plot somewhere somehow whether organized or just moneyed pressures from interested parties. Someone has to be manipulating this right? is it Obama himself just choosing which dick to suck and when or our powerful complex of security organizations? To me things seem unusual in the halls of power (which I am never in just watching from afar), and things are seeming more like a constant powergrab.

81,Help me understand the Clinton email scandal. I'm totally lost.,5.0,45rlsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/45rlsv/help_me_understand_the_clinton_email_scandal_im/,44.0,1455468606.0,"Nothing about this story makes any sense to me, but everybody and their brother seems to be a legal expert on it, so can we take a minute to separate what is known vs. what is alleged at this point in time? 

This article in NRO seems to sum up the case against Clinton nicely, though it seems to make some claims that go against what I've heard elsewhere - ""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431254/hillary-clinton-email-classified-criminal-democratic-nominee""

The TL/DR of this post is essentially ""what is true and what is false in McCarthy's NRO piece?""

For one thing, the article outright states that the FBI is conducting a *criminal* investigation. While the criminal allegations being made are clear, my understanding was that the FBI had not said it was a criminal investigation into Clinton herself, but rather that they were looking into the issue with a wider lens to essentially determine the who-what-where and whatnot. Obviously it could become a criminal investigation at any moment or maybe it has without it being announced.  

Secondly, McCarthy states that nobody knew about the email server. My understanding was that Hillary requested and received permission from the state department to install the server. I also don't understand how ""nobody"" could have been aware given that people would have to be aware so as to install it, and also aware at the State dept. that she wasn't using a regular state department email.

Thirdly is the whole issue of what was classified when by whom and whether it was labeled as such or whether any of that matters at all. That whole question seems like a shell game to me and we could probably create a whole subreddit about it. On this issue I'm just looking to understand what we know as incontrovertible fact versus allegation, opinion, or to-be-determined. From what I've read it's like a mini quantum universe exploded and all possible realities exist simultaneously. 

Fourthly is the question of whether having the server at the time she had it was illegal. McCarthy cites laws predating Hillary's tenure that would indicate that it was. However my understanding was that there was a law passed *afterwards* that made it illegal going forwards. This begs the question of why such a law was necessary if it was illegal to begin with as McCarthy claims. It also begs the question of why none of the numerous people involved in the authorization and technical installation of the server gave any pause to going ahead. 

Fifthly, I don't understand the supposed motive of Clinton doing this in order to avoid FOIA requests. In what way would have having a private server allowed her to hide info from anyone once it was discovered? Isn't the current investigation living proof that such an idea was patently ridiculous? Do those of you who think Hillary had this motive essentially think that she (and the numerous people in her ranks who knew about it) were complete idiots on this point?'

Sixthly - and maybe this is just a matter of waiting for the other shoe to drop - I don't understand why Republicans aren't pointing fingers at all the other people who aided and abetted Hillary in installing this allegedly illegal server. If the general narrative against Hillary is true here, shouldn't there be a whole corral of people about to get indicted along with her for 

Seventhly (autocorrect let me type that, I guess it's a word), in regards to the security of the server from hacking and spies, why hasn't there been more focus on other intelligence agencies dropping the ball on not being aware of this potential breach? Are we to understand that the CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, Secret Service, or other counter-intelligence offices were simply unaware of this? Isn't the fact that one of the most powerful U.S. leaders' communications were un-secured (even if they wanted them that way) a big deal? Isn't the fact that nobody was able to detect and correct this security hole the real scandal here? Seems like if the NSA had been doing it's job, this whole thing could have been avoided with a phone call to Clinton saying ""Uh yeah, Madam Secretary, our data collection shows that you're using a private server for lots of sensitive emails... if you could you go ahead and not do that, that would be great, m'kay?""",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

The obvious one is the mere fact that they were going through our personal conversations without a warrant under the guise of looking for terrorists. This act itself is a violation of fourth amendment rights. Beyond this though is the glaring fact that by doing this the American Government has outright said that it suspects American citizens of being the enemy. Time and time again in history one can see that once any government stops trusting the people, nothing good comes from that situation. 
However that isn't what I want to talk about. What I really am here to say is a simple question. Why isn't anyone protesting this? Sure, you all get on Reddit and other such sites and post articles condemning the NSA and the Department of Homeland, but really what has come of that. Nothing. Civil liberties groups have started to sue the government, but that is a day or two in court and then they are out of the way. What needs to be done is have a group of dedicated people take a stand and say to the politicians and agency directors ""You can't violated the Constitution and get away with it."" Because if Americans just roll over and take this, that tells the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the politicians that they can do whatever they want and get away with it. I know there are those of you that think that a protest doesn't matter and the government won’t change. Well you are right, but it will show them that average people still care enough to stand up fight for what they believe in.

83,CIA review of Senate staffer emails: blown out of proportion?,6.0,2sqihc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2sqihc/cia_review_of_senate_staffer_emails_blown_out_of/,5.0,1421506544.0,"I just read the [report](https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/Redacted-December-2014-Agency-Accountability-Board-Report.pdf) that details this incident. 

**TL;DR: Some IT guys were told to find out if and how Senate staffers accessed documents they weren't supposed to, which were on a *shared* network operated and maintained by the CIA. IT guys did their job, found out the unauthorized documents were accessed, and included a total of 5 staffer emails of no consequence to support their findings. No other emails were accessed or included. Once the older, computer-illiterate important people realized how IT guys were going about their directive, they immediately ordered them to stand down.**

Here's a summary of the facts:

* A shared drive of the Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Network (RDINet) was created to house millions of sensitive documents so that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) could access and review the uploaded documents.
* The RDINet was created by the CIA, maintained by the CIA, and there was no agreement between the CIA and the SSCI as to the level of access to the SSCI side of RDINet to investigate security breaches.
* In fact, the CIA routinely and without controversy searched the SSCI side of RDINet for CIA documents and **it did so on certain occasions at the SSCI staff request**. (Lots of security issues/breaches in the years leading up to this incident).
* When SSCI staff logged on the RDINet, **they were warned ""use of this system may be monitored and you have no expectation of privacy.""**
* Documents that had not been cleared ended up on the SSCI side of RDINet, and certain IT members of the CIA were tasked to find out how, and determine whether it was actually accessed or printed.
* Jan 9, 2014, IT members looked into the SSCI side for files with ""WCR"" or ""SRT"" in their titles, by searching the database, doing a ""Google search of RDINet,"" and conducting a root search. They found that these documents were indeed on the SSCI side, which they were not supposed to be. **No evidence that any work product or confidential staff materials were accessed at this point**.
* Jan 10, 2014, IT members were instructed to demonstrate how SSCI staff would have looked at the WCR documents on the SSCI side of the network, to determine if they accessed/printed the documents, and to take screenshots of the share drive folder and subfolder.
* The report notes that this directive came from the Director of the CIA, and he didn't appreciate what level of forensic techniques would be required to determine what he wanted to learn.
* But even with that, emails were sent to the IT team saying stuff like ""We need to **confine this review as narrowly as possible**, and make sure everyone understands this is not a fishing expedition into SSCI files"" and ""Please DO NOT undertake this tasking if it would require that you search and/or provide us [redaction] relating to the other contents of the RDI Net Y : drive, as this drive is a SSCI staff drive on the RDI Net system.""
* At some point, a third look was conducted to see if the unauthorized files were accessed/printed, and to reconstruct how they were accessed/printed.
* Jan 14, 2014, evening, the Director was briefed about the foregoing and ordered them to ""stand-down immediately"" and not to go into the SSCI side, but that didn't make it to the IT guys in a timely fashion. A proposed joint review with the SSCI was suggested at this time.
* While reconstructing how these unauthorized documents were accessed and printed (which they were), the IT team included 5 innocuous emails in their entire reconstruction. These emails were innocuous because they did not contain any matters ""of consequence or involve discussions of substantive matters.""

As a result, the OIG board concluded that the IT members reasonably believed they were acting under authority when tasked to discover whether SSCI staff had accessed and printed the unauthorized documents.

Well, it turns out that it was never definitely established as a deliberate, conscious lie. 
In fact, Senate investigation found that Bush 'misled' the public about Al Qaeda connection, but that his WMD claims were, while overblown, generally supported by the CIA. They also found no proof of CIA being pressured to produce intelligence; however, some former CIA analysts say that the overall atmosphere of politicization and constant insistence of the administration to find 'something', influenced their wording and made report ('White Paper') to sound a lot more confident than it should have been. The again, they also say that there was a consensus that Saddam did in fact have WMD programs, so they didn't want to challenge it because they didn't have enough evidence suggesting otherwise (Paul Pillar, PBS Frontline, 2007). 
There is also Downing Street Memo, that says Bush was 'fixing evidence around the policy'. While it does prove that the administration was cherry picking evidence, or promoting 'facts' they knew had no basis in reality, it still does not answer one central question.

______________________________________________________

What is happening in North Africa and particularly in Egypt similar to what has happened in the Middle East the past three decades . It also recalls an old plan that colonialism had on the Middle East on a large Islamic area of backward leadership.

It is clear that the old colonialism does not remain, but plans are still functioning. It's no longer about countries that want to exploit other countries, but about companies with major interests of particular commodities. It does not matter where they are, in Europe, U.S., Russia or China. It uses the threat of terrorism to scare people into east and west, north and south.

People are a victim of the new kind of capitalism. it seems that fate has taken hold over human reason and no one is safe anymore, not even those who think they own the companies. It's profits that determine, not reason. In order to create chaos and fear they refrain not to sponsor terrorism, among other things, the funding of extremists.
Examples are the former extreme Marxists as Carlos, but the focus is now on the Islamists. CIA's sponsorship of Al Qaeda is well known, and the United States is the only country in the world who have been convicted guilty by the International Court of Justice as a state sponsor of terrorism.

What is revolution? There must be preconditions for it. What is happening in Egypt began with the popular uprising in Tunisia, people who are unhappy about the high global food prices and unemployment. The rebellion has spread to several countries in the region.

Calling it a political revolution and this is just a joke that the media has spread and affected. That  Mobarak disappeared and the military took over can not reasonably be called a successful revolution. We will see an Islamist regime change eventually.

The dictators who more or less prevailed in three decades of the field by the Shah of Iran, Saddam in Iraq and Mobarak in Egypt have already used up and not filled the requirements the new form of capitalism down. They must be removed and so light they disappeared!

 

 

But why insists you to call it that revolution. Man have seen a successful attempt in Iran with pre-printing of freethinkers who anti-revolutionaries and guilt of the population in that it was their own idea. Which is typical of such movements is that eliminated any real leaders and thinkers before such a shift. However, just the Islamic, organized movement is retained.

 

Before the so-called revolution in Iran, wrote a philosophy student (Bijan Jazani) that an alternative to capitalism instead of the Shah's Khomeini. He and several options were executed two years before the revolution.

 

However, the established Islamist regime in Iran is and has been effective for the pillage of raw materials, spreading Islamism in the region and used as a scarecrow against other peoples and through the dissemination of ideas terorism able to stifle the last breaths of democracy has remained in the West. 
Such a regime would be to maintain and if something happens there and people show their discontent with the many millions who will out, run almost nothing about it in media. I refer to my article which was written in Newsmill.se 2009.  People in Sweden and probably most of the countries belonging to the same media monopolies were misled of media . It slowed cruel. It is so clear to most Iranians who were involved in question.

""When Obama spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the phone last Thursday, Obama did not know about the man's arrest, and the matter did not come up, according to U.S. officials. The C.I.A.'s failure to tell the president worried White House officials.""

From this article:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/obama-german-spy_n_5570503.html

I understand that there are some things a president won't know. It would be expecting too much for a President to ""know everything"" that the government was doing. There will always be some reliance on heads of departments to prioritize information to give to the President.

I also understand that there may be some things that a President won't know, by design. Plausible deniability, and so on.

But the Germany spy issue seems like an important thing to know, given everything that has transpired in the past year.

I can imagine that the President *did* know, and might be lying. But I could easily imagine the CIA working on some kind of 'need to know basis', and not filling in the President. This has also made me wonder if there have been situations that have developed that a President hasn't known about, and when exposed a President *doesn't* admit to not knowing about it.

I'm sure we could imagine situations like those where they wouldn't want people to realize that the President didn't know what was going on, or that maybe the President for whatever reason didn't want the agency/department to take the responsibility for something bad.

This has made me wonder in a broader sense about the relative autonomy of certain government agencies. Military, FBI, CIA, NSA, DHS. I know there is potential to wade into conspiracy theory, but seeing as this is recent news, I wanted a review discussion. What do we know about the history and current capability of government agencies 'going rouge', pursuing their own agenda, and not informing anyone else about it? Or perhaps a President telling these agencies ""Weapons free"" and do whatever they want as long as they get their jobs done?

It's very sobering, especially if you've been following the timeline of attack Fox News has been trying to papier-mâché together.

Now, here's a [blog post](http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2012/11/01/washington-post-david-ignatius-benghazi-time-line-has-something-peculiar-in-it-an-admission-the-cia-knew-this-was-terrorism-at-430am-on-911/) from Greta Wire. 

This is the quote from the Ignatius article that Greta takes issue with:

> The first idea is to go to a Benghazi hospital to recover Stevens, who they [CIA reinforcements] rightly suspect is already dead. **But the hospital is surrounded by the al-Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia militia that mounted the consulate attack…**.”  

Here's the Greta Wire response:

> Surrounded by the al Qaeda linked Ansar al Sharia militia that mounted the consular attack?   I don’t know if that information … was put together in the weeks after the attack — or if known at or about the time of the attack or even within days of the attack.

> If the foregoing underlined information was known by the CIA at or about the time of the attack, then President Obama was really off the charts when he again repeated, 13 days later, on Sept.24 on David Letterman the video story.

There are two childishly simple problems with this line of reasoning. The first: those were Ignatius' words Greta quoted, not the CIA's. His article gives us a timeline of what Ignatius *now* knows happened, not *what he thought he knew then*. 

Secondly, that's true of the CIA's words as well! For the CIA to have said that the hospital was surrounded by ""al-Qaeda linked Ansar al-Sharia"" is not for them to have said that the quick response team nor other CIA officials had an ID of those surrounding the hospital in the first place.

This, I think, beautifully captures conspiratorial thinking. It's the same style of thinking that Truthers exuded after 9/11 (v. 1.0) and Birthers exude to this day. It's also precisely the style of thinking that carried Hitler to power. It's the style of thinking that buttresses highly simplistic worldviews, whether they be leftist or rightist. And it's the style of thinking most people are frustrated with re: Fox News. 

All you need to do is inconsistently spread the benefit of the doubt (which is necessary currency in logical discourse) onto the shoulders of preconceived and predefined opponents, thereby exhausting their resources to prove away your doubt.

Here are some important facts that the Republican propaganda machine needs to think about as it continues to criticize Obama in regards to the Benghazi attacks.


[In 1983, during the Reagan administration, the US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon was attacked by a suicide bomber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_embassy_bombing). There were 63 dead, including 17 Americans.  There WAS NO U.S. MILITARY response to this attack. Those responsible for the attack **have never been determined or found**.


In 1988, during the Reagan administration, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland. There WAS NO  U.S. MILITARY response to this attack. [It took a THREE-YEAR JOINT INVESTIGATION by Scottish police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to find the terrorists responsible for the attack.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103)


In October, 2000 the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by suicide bombers. There WAS NO  U.S. MILITARY response to this attack. **It took between 2 and 12 years to find & capture** the terrorists.  The Clinton, Bush Jr. and Obama administrations have all been involved in resolving this attack. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri [was captured two years later](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahim_al-Nashiri). Abu Ali al-Harithi [was killed by a drone, 2 years later](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/05/1036308311314.html?oneclick=true). Tawfiq (Khallad) Bin Attash  [was captured by U.S. forces 3 years laters]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_bin_Attash).

The Benghazi attack was not an act of  the Libyan government or the military. A U.S. military attack is not appropriate. We already attacked Libya earlier in the year to help remove Gaddafi. A transitional government is currently in place. This was an opportunistic attack by handful of hack terrorists. [The whereabouts of the alleged mastermind, Ahmed Abu Khattala, is unknown](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-libya-consulate-attack-idUSBRE89H19P20121018). For all we know he's holed up in a cave in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border mountains.

This is now an investigation for the CIA & the military intelligence. They will have to hunt down Ahmed Abu Khattala and his co-conspirators.

It's only natural to want answers as to why the attacked happened and why U.S. citizens were killed. However, in this world of the 365/24/7 sensationalistic news cycle, the answers aren't going to come as quickly has the partisan media wants it to come.

Both of these acts legitimize the secret FISA Court subpoenas and the Patriot Act.  Neither seem to be exactly what the public is wanting or calling for.

From [""The USA Freedom Act is Real Spying Reform""](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform):

    I will rein in the abuse of both the Patriot Act and the U.S. Constitution

That's Senator Leahy. The man with jurisdiction over the both the FISA and the Patriot Act. Does he wants to end the abuse. No. He wants to rein it in. The same way an abusive father might rein in his abuses so as to not worry the neighbors. He gives himself rules to keep doing it (no hitting in the face, no using knuckles, etc.). This works out for parts of the abused child, like the face. But the abuse continues.  

And the abuse was foreseen, but not by the myopic Sensenbrenner, who actually authored the Patriot Act itself.  His lack of foresight should have had him tarred and feathered, but instead he is leading the pitchforks. 


Today we have two choices.

[The USA Freedom Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform)

    1. The secret FISA court can still issue subpoenas but is limited to (not the face) -associates of terrorists. Watch out Kevin Bacon.
    2. Restricts NSA/CIA/FBI/IRS/DHS from searching through FAA (FISA Amendment Act) collected data -unless its an emergency or court ordered (so always).
    3. Keeps bulk collection where it is so it doesn't jump to another agency. (Keep it in the house. Close the windows. Draw the curtains).
    4. Creates an advocate before the FISA Court and new transparency requirements. ...The head of the Judiciary Committee's (Leahy's) way of saying, ""The buck stops err uh -over there.""
    5. Does not make what has been happening illegal, for absolutely no reason. Despite the fact that the public wants it to be illegal to peep on us.

[FISA Improvement Act](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/sen-dianne-feinsteins-nsa-reforms-bad-privacy-bad)

    1. Is the option you are suppose to be against. This is the skinnier of the two carrots.
    2. Will make you feel like legal bulk collection in The USA Freedom Act is what you are a OK with for now.
    3. Entrenches powers like The USA Freedom Act, but unlike the USA Freedom Act it expands them. Why do this unless you want to make it explicit that ""this is not the carrot you want.""
    4. Allows foreign queries of civilians including US citizens abroad.

My view of these issues is limited to the fact that I had my phone in hand and was ready to start making calls before I realized I'd better figure out what the hell I was going to say that I actually disliked or liked about each act. I have also only read the literature provided in the top post mentioned above.  Please view this as a jumping off point of discussion and a chance to educate myself, yourself, and others in regards to this issue. I just want to make sure that I/we don't have our pants pulled down again in front of the whole world.

If we are to have The USA Freedom Act passed, what actions are left to be done? We must be ready to tell the world how we will tie up the loose ends.

And we better have a good damn reason as to why we didn't just go ahead and tie them up today. As for me, right now, I don't see one.  What do you think?

>Reports of the number of militants versus civilian casualties differ.[12] In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution wrote that drone strikes may have killed ""10 or so civilians"" for every ""mid- and high-ranking [al Qaeda and Taliban] leader.""[13] In contrast, the New America Foundation has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants.[14] The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were hardcore Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.[15] The CIA believes that the strikes conducted since May 2010 have killed over 600 militants and have not caused any civilian fatalities, a claim that experts disputed and have called absurd.[12] Based on extensive research, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that between 391 – 780 civilians were killed out of a total of between 1,658 and 2,597 and that 160 children are reported among the deaths. The Bureau also revealed that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners, tactics that have been condemned by legal experts.[16][17][18] Barbara Elias-Sanborn has also cautioned that, ""as much of the literature on drones suggests, such killings usually harden militants' determination to fight, stalling any potential negotiations and settlement.""[19]

Let's just play a numbers game here.  If you were killed by drone strike from another country, how many people do you know who would suddenly have a lot of (well-deserved) resentment toward the country sending in the drones?  Your entire immediate family, most likely.  Probably some of your extended family, too.  And of course your closest friends.  Each of these people would probably then qualify as a ""terrorist"" in the eyes of the country that killed you.  And how many people would that be?  10?  20?  For the sake of this exercise, let's use the lower number to avoid exaggeration.

Suppose the Brookings Institution's numbers are right (10 civilian deaths per mid-high level Taliban/Al-Qaeda member death).  If each civilian's death made for 10 new ""terrorist"" recruits, then we're talking about 10*10 = 100 new ""terrorists"" for every mid-high level leader's death.  50 of these 100 would be mid-level or higher, so basically what we have here is a process in which drone strikes are creating 50 mid-to high-level terrorists for every mid- to high- level terrorist killed.

The last name of these two brothers is Tsarnaev.

They have at least two uncles in the US who are involved in efforts to have the US government support the Chechen revolt against Russia.  (This closely parallels the era when the CIA supported a guy name of Osama Bin Laden as a leader in the Afghan revolt against the USSR.)

The following comes from corporate filing documents in Maryland and Washington DC:

---
* Congress of Chechen International Organizations, Incorporated was a Maryland corporation registered at 11114 Whisperwood Lane, Rockville, MD 20852.  Principle agent in that file was Ruslan Tsarnaev, one of the two uncles of the known pair of Boston bombers.  This address was owned by Graham E. Fuller, a Russian-speaking former CIA agent with ties to the Iran-Contra affair and a former station chief in Kabul, Afghanistan.  His daughter married Ruslan Tsarnaev.  That marriage officially dissolved in 1999; we have no way of knowing if it was real or an immigration scam.

* A Washington DC corporation of that same name as above was first registered on 9/22/1995, file number 953065, status now listed as “revoked”.

* The “United States-Chechen Republic Alliance Inc.” is listed at 8920 Walden Rd, Silver Springs MD 20901-3823.  Established in December of 2002 as a Maryland corporation, still active.  It appears to be connected more (at least on paper) to the other uncle of the bombers, Alvi S. Tsarnaev (brother to Ruslan).
---

By 2005 relations with top former Chechen rebels had developed in the US to a point where one of their top players (Ilyas Akhmado) was officially in the US under an asylum visa and didn't need to marry a US citizen to get here.  Akhmado is a known associate of the older Tsarnaev brothers and held a higher rank under the Chechen rebellion than any of the Tsarnaev clan.  Akhmado was interviewed by the Washington Post in 2005 and stated that he left Grozny in Chechnia in 1999 – which strongly suggests the Tsarnaevs were here first.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38200-2005Mar15.html 

The asylum status for these guys was supported by, among others, Zbigniew Brzezinski who had first secured US connections to the Chechen revolt against Russia – likely in an attempt to get at oil reserves in the former Southern USSR region.  *This US political support of Chechen rebels is how all the members of the Tsarnaev family in the US got asylum.*

The Russians claim that all of these people are terrorists who supported (among other things) the horrific mass school shooting at Beslen where 300 died at Chechen hands.  The Russian security services and at times Putin himself have strongly condemned US asylum for these Chechens, declaring this asylum equivalent to how the US would feel if Russia had harbored Osama Bin Laden.  The Russians had also pointed out that the younger Tsarnaevs in particular were trouble before the bombings.

OK.  So what exactly happened at Boston?

First, we know that the FBI has at times enticed various idiotic US resident Islamics into ""going to Jihad"" but then catching them before anything actually blows up.  They then claim each of these incidents as a ""win in the War On Terror[tm]"" (which I think is questionable).  ***I do not think the FBI was similarly involved with the Tsarnaev brats.***  But I am starting to think somebody used the same sort of tricks as the FBI uses, targeting the younger Tsarnaevs in order to implicate their older kinfolk and put a stake through the heart of anything remotely like a *“United States-Chechen Republic Alliance Inc.”* - by letting the bombs actually happen with the name ""Tsarnaev"" linked to it (knowing the two brats are morons bound to get caught).

***So there are three possibilities here.***

1) The two younger Tsarnaev brothers went ""suddenly Jihad"" with no actual connection to their family name or situation.  Possible I guess.  (They may have been enticed by outside agents but purely because they were potential young Islamic radicals, not because they were Tsarnaevs.)

2) Somebody Islamic enticed them into this to disrupt the US-ChechenRebel alliance.  May have even been somebody from Chechnia who sees the US as the ""great satan"" or whatever and doesn't want us helping out over there.  Or maybe it was somebody from an Islamic bunch outside of Chechnia who wanted to keep the Chechnian rebellion ""pure"" or something.  Also plausible.

3) Somebody *non-Islamic* wanted the alliance disrupted.  Doesn't take a rocket physicist to figure that one out but I won't say it out loud.  Question is, could a foreign government pull the same sort of ""enticement trick"" the FBI is now famous for, except let the bombs actually go off?  Ummm...yeah.  Easy.

However we ~~promptly killed him and started making fake videos~~ let him slip away through one of the only two mountain passes leaving Afghanistan, Tora Bora - only to find him in his concrete Pakistani McMansion 9 years later. With their terrorist sanctuary destroyed, surely there will be no more attacks?

But no, as we found out later the hijackers spent their entire time ""training"" inside the US, using the real names, at various flight schools in Florida. However that fell by the wayside as Bush crushed their pathetically weak and poorly equipped army. Afghanistan was now under NATO control, and we began the slow, decade-plus long mission of spreading freedom and installing democracy. Next stop: Iraq!

I realize that the story of Afghanistan stretches back centuries, but for my generation it started on 9/11. Without much context, the story was ""bad people attacked us, let's get revenge"". However nothing happens in a vacuum except maybe playing space tennis. What we totally overlooked was the ominous, foreboding almost, experience of the Soviet Union who made a similar mistake.

On Christmas eve 1979, the Soviets launched an invasion of Afghanistan to support the [PDPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDPA), who had taken power in a coup on 27 April 1978. The war happened pretty much as you'd expect. They wanted to give the people of Afghanistan the gift of communism and supported equal rights for women. In doing so they had to kill lots of Taliban insurgents and install a puppet government. Of course they weren't called Taliban back then, these rag-tag group of Pashtun freedom fighters were called [Mujihadeen](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Mortar_attack_on_Shigal_Tarna_garrison%2C_Kunar_Province%2C_87.jpg) - look familiar? For those of you who weren't alive in the 80s, or haven't seen Charlie Wilson's War, we [the USA] armed and equipped these individuals with a generous supply of weapons including heat-seeking stinger missiles with portable launchers - an expensive gift made in the good old USA. Needless to say after losing a bunch of helicopters and almost 15,000 men they started withdrawing their troops in 1988 and by Feb 15, 1989 all Soviet troops [were gone](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Evstafiev-afghan-apc-passes-russian.jpg), a little over 9 years of warfare. They must have had a hell of a hangover from their party with the Mujihadeen because within a year the Soviet Union as we knew it began to disintegrate into its constituent states.  

Coming back to 2012, here we are essentially fighting this same group and all for what? Some are naive enough (I was at one point) to believe it's about spreading Freedom And Democracy (TM) across the middle east. Some might say it's for the ~~oil~~ [minerals](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html?emc=na) but this 'stunning discovery' looks like an almost desperate plea to keep our troops there - you never know, there might be some Lithium in it for you. 

No, I think the real reason is the fault of geography and mistakenly thinking we're still in the age of empires. Afghanistan occupies a strategic point on the grand chessboard - it borders central Asia and the Caspian Sea, one of the biggest energy prizes left in a planet scraping the bottom of the barrel. It borders Pakistan, the only Muslim country with nuclear weapons. It borders China, the world's biggest energy user and second biggest economy and ""strategic competitor"" of the United States. Oh, and I hear it's second longest border besides the one with Pakistan is with Iran, but I couldn't imagine why we would be interested in that country.

War costs money. If you plan on invading a country, even the kings of the medieval era knew they better have something worthwhile. Slavery is mostly frowned upon today so imagine if there was a renewable resource with a demand that's always there and the customers are the most loyal ever? 

Welcome to heroin, arguably the world's most addictive drug. It's no secret that Hamid Karzai (our puppet dictator) has a brother (Wali Karzai) who is involved in trafficking drugs. After we invaded, opium poppy cultivation has [blossomed](http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/afghan_opium_production_1994_2009.jpg) and it is the source for 80-90% of the entire world's heroin supply today. Therefore, if you see someone shooting up, whether it's in New York or Moscow, chances are they are using drugs that originated in Afghanistan. 

Could it be that we are looking the other way while our puppet government funds itself through the drug trade? Is it possible that we are actually [helping protect](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/10/14066.html) the poppy fields from the Taliban, who want cultivation banned? Who knows, maybe the CIA is involved with trafficking in drugs like they were alleged to be doing in South America? Who knows, indeed. I wish I did.

I'm sorry if this post came off as too sarcastic, this is a serious subject to me, but the lies and manipulation are just too much to bear. I don't support the war on drugs and I definitely don't support this war for drugs. If I were president I would order all the troops back today. Hopefully they are all back by 2014. Killing for oil is bad enough, but killing for heroin? I guess that makes us a nation of gangsters and thugs.

Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State, therefore in charge of the CIA, therefore responsible for the unconstitutional hacking of Senators' communications. For some reason Fox has, in their Benghazi-epilepsy, managed to generally dodge the unconstitutionality (in a moral sense, not legally) of the NSA surveillance program (possibly because Murdoch was himself accused of supervising illegal surveillance in England for which he was deemed guilty of 'willful blindness'), but Clinton is the Dem front-runner, and if Christie can be felled by a bridge blocking scandal I think the CIA spying on the body responsible for their oversight counts as a proper scandal.

I guess what I'm saying is: Since we have admissions, and something awfully close to perjury, can we push for some kind of investigation here? Nobody seems to be willing to move on privacy in any way, but I can't believe the right would give her a pass on this, am I wrong?",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

I am not talking about party affiliation news channels like Fox and MSNBC, I am talking about a complete media collaboration. Few people know that the supposedly left leaning New York Times had the Pentagon Papers long before they ever were published and had no intention of publishing them. 

I would love for people to contribute examples of when the media colludes to protect information. I have two common examples. The first is that the media almost always colludes and calls [CIA operatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/20/iran.hikers.bio/index.html?hpt=hp_c2) ""Hitchhikers"". This is something I have noticed for ten years but realized most people don't recognize this. You can search endless archives of stories of ""Hitchhikers"" accidentally or supposedly crossing the border into an enemy country. 
The second most common example is that in war almost all of our aircraft crashes due to ""[malfunction](http://www.freep.com/article/20110812/NEWS06/108120376/Petoskey-grad-killed-helicopter-crash-Afghanistan)"". This is usually code for being shot down but in a war it is important not to give the enemy any reason to celebrate. Although there are some good reasons to do this I find it highly suspicious the degree in which this happens. Here is an example of why this should alarm us. Go back to any archive that printed an article of the Julian Assange ""Sexual Assault Case"". Almost all of them labeled it as a rape case. This not only offends me but is also a scary practice. I would love to see other contributions from Redditors. Please try and refrain from conspiracy theories or at least put a disclaimer of a conspiratorial thought.

**Concerning the past**

Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and co. will be given to the ICC to be tried for war crimes.

Telecom immunity with FISA will be removed.  The acts were illegal when they were committed, and those responsible will be prosecuted.

Those responsible for the Financial Crash of 2008 will be prosecuted.

Those responsible for the BP Oil Spill in the Gulf will be prosecuted.

*This will send a message that the US is returning to the rule of law for all citizens, not just the poor and powerless.*

We will disband the TSA and DHS and strictly enforce citizens' right to privacy and free assembly.  Agencies such as the NSA, FBI, CIA, NRO, etc. will be thoroughly audited to insure that no Americans are being targeted.  Those responsible for originating orders contrary to the rule of law will be prosecuted.

**Concerning the present**

We will reduce the defense budget without reducing pay for our troops.  We will also strengthen their retirement benefits and the VA.  We will do this by cutting down on wasteful programs like the F-22 and Littoral Combat Ships and ending combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the rest of the Middle East and Africa.

We will end farm subsidies to large Agribusiness, end corn subsidies, and promote the proliferation of small farms.

We will end the War on Drugs, disbanding the DEA legalizing and taxing all drugs.  The taxes go to fund rehabilitation and harm-reduction programs.  One of these harm-reduction programs will be clinics at which drugs are provided to addicts free of charge.

We will re-examine welfare policies and seek to provide for people while discouraging a culture of poverty.

**Looking forward**

We will end subsidies to Big Oil and begin transitioning to [solar energy](http://1bog.org/files/2010/10/what_if_solar_was_subsidized_like_fossil_fuels_sm.jpg).  By 2020, every car on the road will be electric, powered by this clean and sustainable resource.  Larger vehicles will be a combination of electric and bio-diesel.

We will fund our infrastructure, both improving peoples' ability to get around and providing a massive stimulus for the middle class.  We will seek to use smaller contractors where ever possible.  This will include a network of high speed rail going up and down each coast, as well as from coast to coast.

We will seek a fairer, progressive tax system.

We will examine current regulations regarding the business world, eliminating those which give existant businesses an unfair advantage but keeping or implementing new regulations that discourage malfeasance. 

We will implement a system of Universal, Single Payer Healthcare.

We will strengthen our education system, bringing it under federal control and looking to other nations for examples of what works and what does not.

We will begin studying how to improve our justice system with the goal of making it equitable again by 2020.

Lastly, we will begin the process of creating a new Constitution, fit for modern times.  We can't control what will be in this document, but my administration will lobby for a better and more democratic system of voting such as Instant Run Off.  The final decision, however, will rest in the hands of the framers.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

If anything, he has **legitimized** many of Bush's policies for future administrations and even on policies Obama has overturned he hasn't explicitly prohibited them by law.

Consider torture. Obama issued an Executive Order prohibiting the CIA from using Bush-era torture practices. An Executive Order is not a law established by Congress so it can be easily turned over by the next President (recently Cain and Bachmann stated they would re-enact Bush's torture policies). Obama also refused to prosecute anyone who participated in torture or even Cheney who admitted repeatedly he authorized the use of torture. This should have been one of Obama's main objectives because it would have set precedents in American law as to the illegality of torture. Instead he did what was politically expedient and temporarily barred torture.

This is the kind of shit he has done. Instead of dismantling the war industry, he has expanded it. The war in Afghanistan has continued; a new war in Libya had begun and all prospects of that country centers on its oil production; the war in Iraq is coming to an end despite Obama's efforts to extend the withdrawal date past 2011; we've bombed and invaded Pakistan; we've sent cluster bombs to Israel; we sent arms to Africa; and we are still the world' largest arms dealer.

Instead of winding down the drug war, Obama has expanded it and also increased the amount of money we spend across the world to fight the illegal drug industry. His administration also armed drug cartels for fuck's sake.

Instead of ending Corporate Welfare he has made it worse, a hell of a lot worse. The Obama healthcare reform is Fascist-style corporatism. We've continued to bail-out banks; no one was ever held responsible for the banking disaster; and we have given the banking industry a much bigger role in our government while trying to regulate them at the same time. On top of all that, 70% of Obama's startup cash for 2012 came from the extremely wealthy.

His only policies seem to be welfare and regulations but none of these will do anything as long as the government is playing ball with the banks, corporations and military industries. He hasn't done anything to prevent future administrations from resorting to Bush's policies or trying to abuse Presidential powers and this will continue to perpetuate the problems we have (like our world wars). His lack of willingness to take a stand on several key issues (like the War in Iraq or Torture) has shown himself to put the well-being of his party first.

He's a party-loyalist and corporate shill. Stop funding him and stop supporting the two-party system.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

1949:CIA backs military coup in Syria, ousting elected government.
 
1953: CIA overthrows democratically elected Iranian government, placing the Shah in power. In 1951, Iranian parliament had nationalized the British Anglo-Iranian oil company. This popular move was spearheaded by the reformer, Mossadegh, who was elected prime minister shortly after. Britain and the US organize ruthless economic blockade. Shortly before the coup, the Communist Party calls a 100,000 strong demonstration to protest the US and the Shah. Nine hours of street fighting finally quells popular rebellion against the coup.
 
1954: Iranian oil re-privatized, with US and Britain in control. Popular opposition compels the Shah to rule through a reign of terror unrivalled in the region. US helps fund huge military and police build-up, and trains Savak, the notorious secret police. Amnesty International would write in 1976 that Iran had the “highest rate of death penalties in the world, no valid system of civilian courts and a history of torture which is beyond belief. No country in the world has a worse record in human rights than Iran.”
 
1957-58: Syria and Egypt take steps toward a merger, reflecting revolutionary yearning of the Arab masses to unite against Western imperialism. The US Sixth Fleet is dispatched, and huge arms shipments are delivered to US client regimes. Syria and Egypt claim to uncover “at least eight separate conspiracies to overthrow one or the other government, to assassinate Nasser, and/or prevent the merger of the two countries.” Independent evidence detailing several of these failed plots subsequently emerges.
 
1958: Iraq and Lebanon: Two weeks after 1958 Egypt/Syria merger, the US establishes “Baghdad Pact,” uniting monarchies and puppet regimes against threat of Nasserism and growing Soviet influence. Mass rioting erupts throughout the region. Iraqi troops are ordered into Jordan to put down unrest. Under popular pressure, the army mutinies and instead marches on the royal palace. The hated King, Crown Prince, and Prime Minister are lynched.
 
The next day, US Marines land in Lebanon and British troops are dispatched to Jordan. A virtual civil war erupts as 14,000 US troops enter Lebanon at the invitation of the unpopular, CIA-backed government of Chamoun. Lebanese forces manage to put down the rebellion after months of urban clashes. President Eisenhower would later write: “This somber turn of events could, without a vigorous response on our part, result in the complete elimination of Western influence in the Middle East.”
 
1963: Right wing of Iraq’s Ba’ath party leads successful coup with US support, after unsuccessful US assassination attempt against Iraqi leader, Abdul Karim Qassim. The CIA provides Ba’ath party with names of Iraqi communists to murder, and the CP is ruthlessly slaughtered.
 
1968: A counter-coup, in which Saddam Hussein participates, leads to nationalization of Iraqi oil in 1972.
 
1973-75: To destabilize Iraq during a border dispute with Iran, US supports Kurdish rebels with $16 million in arms, promising to back them in their struggle for autonomy. When Iran and Iraq reach an agreement in 1975 and seal off their border, Iraq proceeds to violently suppress the Kurdish rebellion. US ends support for Kurds and denies them refuge. Henry Kissinger, architect of the ploy, explained, “covert action should not be confused with missionary work.”
 
1973, 1978: A nationalist coup in 1973 brings down the Afghan monarchy. A 1978 coup puts the Stalinist Peoples Democratic Party in power. Afraid of growing Afghan ties to the Soviet Union, US begins covert funding for the reactionary Islamic Fundamentalist rebels. Mujahideen “Freedom Fighters” (according to President Ronald Reagan), are lead by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose “followers first gained attention by throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil.” Six months later, the Soviet Union sends in troops to prop-up the Afghan government.
 
1979-92: US gives over $3 billion in arms and aid to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. CIA sets up training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan – some of the same “terrorist training camps” the US will bomb in 2001. Osama bin Laden and many other of today’s Islamic Fundamentalist terrorist leaders are direct recipients of US aid and training. By 1992, more than a million Afghan people will have died, three million disabled, and five million made refugees, in total about half the population. The civil war continues to this day.
 
1979: Striking oil workers and students in Iran call for ousting the Shah, sparking a revolutionary uprising. US tells Shah it supports him “without reservation” and urges him to violently crush protest, but Shah is overthrown.
 
1980: Iraq invades Iran. Though antagonistic to both countries, the US intervenes to promote and prolong the conflict, looking to weaken both regimes. US opposes UN resolution condemning Iraq’s invasion, takes Iraq off its list of nations supporting terrorism, and allows US arms transfers to Saddam Hussein. US urges Israel to arm Iran, and in 1985 the US secretly provides arms to Iran directly.
 
1982-83: Heavily funded, armed, and backed by the US, Israel invades Lebanon. Over 17,000 civilians are massacred. US blocks several UN resolutions calling for an Israeli withdrawal. In 1983, US troops also land in Lebanon to intervene in the civil war.
 
1984: Iraq uses chemical weapons on Iran; US subsequently restores diplomatic relations with Iraq. A US Defense Intelligence Agency official involved in aiding Iraq later commented that the Pentagon “wasn’t so horrified by Iraq’s use of gas. It was just another way of killing people.”
 
1987: As Iran gets the upper hand in war with Iraq, the US moves to decisively back Iraq. A massive US armada in Persian Gulf ensures arms deliveries to Iraq. When a US gunship shoots down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing 290 passengers, Vice President Bush says, “I will never apologize for America. I don’t care what the facts are.”
 
1985-90: The US showers Iraq with billions in arms, loans, and aid. After Saddam Hussein uses chemical weapons to murder thousands of the Kurdish opposition in Iraq, the Bush administration continues to license the sale of chemical weapons, and blocks UN initiatives to curb their use.
 
1991: After Iraq invades Kuwait in 1990, US launches Operation Desert Storm – the most aggressive, high-tech military campaign in the history of warfare. Dropping more bomb tonnage than in all of Vietnam or World War Two, the 43 day air campaign kills between 100,000 and 200,000 Iraqis and destroys civilian infrastructure. Fearing a popular revolt and the destabilization of the region, the US refuses to aid previously encouraged uprisings by Kurds and Shi’as in the weeks after the war. US denies the rebels access to captured Iraqi weapons, and allows Iraqi helicopters use of “No-fly Zone” airspace to crush the uprising.
 
1990-now: Severe economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the UN. By UN estimates, the sanctions have cost over a million lives, half of them children. About 5,000 children die each month, mostly from malnutrition and treatable diseases. From the most economically advanced country in the region before the US attack, Iraq today is among the most destitute.
 
1998: Renewed US and British bombing campaign – called Operation Desert Fox – against Iraq after it exposes US spies among UN weapons inspectors (later admitted by US officials). The UN pulls out inspectors before bombings, which continue to the present on average every other day.
 
2001: Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, the US launches a war on Afghanistan, killing over 3,500 people. US led UN occupation of the country props up US puppet regime of Karzai.

So assuming these organizations actually stick to their mandate, what should it be? Expanded even more? Reduced? Eliminated? I'd like to hear your thoughts in this thread. Here's my summary:

- Counter intelligence: Finding out the identity of foreign spies in your country. This is extremely hard to do without sacrificing many civil liberties and has an uncertain payoff. Also, you will never get all of them and recruiting new ones is always a possibility. Forget it. 

- Counter-terrorism: Defeating terrorism is impossible, but they say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Even if you do infiltrate an extremist group, what then? It seems like sometimes the impetus is to push them towards violent acts (which is then a set-up) in order to have a reason to prosecute. On the other hand even if an intelligence agency does their job and warns the executive branch, like prior to 9/11, it's no use if the administration willingly plugs their ears. Even though it was intelligence failure of epic scale, the budget of the intelligence community was greatly expanded in the aftermath. 

- Spying: If you are wiretapping individuals, hacking e-mails, stealing information from PCs or servers, or any other activity that would otherwise be illegal in most countries, it should cease. It's time to realize that breaking the laws of foreign countries and stealing information is not a friendly action and carries diplomatic repercussions if exposed. This role should be eliminated completely because of its cost in international relations and no tangible benefit for the country as a whole.

What they could be doing:

- Open source intelligence: The CIA factbook is used as a reference worldwide when it comes to national figures and estimates. Nobody really knows how accurate it is but more precise surveys and research could yield better data and information about other countries that are useful to the business sector, education or even military to understand the capabilities of foreign powers.

- Nothing: Could we just do away with the NSA, CIA, NRO, DIA, etc. etc. etc? Well on the plus side, you would save upwards of 100 billion dollars. On the downside, there might be a slightly elevated risk of terrorist attacks succeeding. On the upside, we would save a significant amount of budget that could be used somewhere much more productive, such as infrastructure investment, which while it may not prevent a terrorist attack, may prevent a sudden bridge collapse that kills a dozen or so people.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

No I'm downvoting douchebags who use the word Paultards instead of having an adult discussion. The reason I support and will vote for Ron Paul is not because I think he will get elected because he will not in my opinion, it's because many of our ideals have been lost slowly over time since the cold war altered our perception of what our role should be in the world. This was then thrown into an extreme after 9/11. If it doesent absolutely infuriate you that we have arrived at the point where some fucking self important douchebag with a degree in homeland security from a degree factory college can decide that you are a potential terrorist and have you detained indefinately without the right to representation or trial then i suggest you never celebtrate the fourth of july again. The reason Ron Paul has such fanatical support from his fan base is not because they think getting rid of FEMA is a totally good idea, but because they are tierd of watching the government take their freedoms away one Patriot act at a time and squander the money they tax from us. Anyone who believes their freedoms arent worth the risk of getting killed over missed the whole point of the revolution. We have spent nearly 8 trillion dollars ""gettin dem terrorists"" and are 16 Trillion in debt yet people want to maintain our status quo? Where and how do you see this getting better? Ron Paul predicted all this was going to happen in an address to congress after 9/11 (yes i realise i sound like im refering to him as a prophet but i assure you i do not feel that way :P ) yet he is constantly dismissed as a ""crazy loon that has no idea what hes talking about"" My hope for Ron Paul is not that he will be elected, but that his large support base will draw American domestic and overseas policies back into the realm of the rational. With most of the other serious Republican canidates I see conflict with Iran or Syria becoming a reality. Paul often talks about blowback which mayor Giuliana scoffed at like an all knowing snotty fuck during the debates last election. Being the Mayor of a city that got hit doesent make you a foreign policy expert just a flag waving patriot who wants to blow shit up. Which BTW we have blown up over a million Iraqis, i'm sure they are totally thankful for the freedom we gave them. And I bet they are not pissed at our latest incident of covering up the fact that our troops busted into a hope, handcuffed the family, shot them all in the back of the head, then called in an air strike to cover it up, then chose to cover up at the top levels of our government. I bet we are reallywinning their fucking hearts and minds. And now one of the top Rebel leaders in Libya revealed that he was tortured by CIA agents years ago. At least he has the spine and stand up and say I don't want revenge, I want a trial for those who tortured me. Though many of the irrational public would immediately demand revenge and some still will over the news that their hero was tortured by the American CIA. Oops is that a good example of our violating human rights overseas causing blowback?

Those are the reasons I support Ron Paul. In the age of, if you dont support blowing up the brown skins because their rights as people are less than ours then you arent a patriot, we have let ourselves go to shit and need a sane voice to stop our spiral of self destruction.

Iraq was a full scale war. We basically flattened the entire nation. Remember “Shock and Awe?” We didn’t care about the people on the ground who were just born their and didn’t care anything about the military or politics. We turned the entire nation to glass. Over 300,000 men women and children dead. And afterwards Bush landed on an aircraft carrier and said mission accomplished. To top it off the reason we went was solely for profit. As it has now been proven, all of the evidence was fabricated. The one guy who tried to say hey this is not true because I was there.. the government outed his wife as a CIA agent. This is direct treason. The guy who outed his wife received a presidential pardon from the president. We have real life war criminals in America right now as we speak and they cannot leave the country because if they do, they will be arrested by the international community.

119,Do you think there are similarities between Trump and Nixon?,0.0,4cidyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4cidyf/do_you_think_there_are_similarities_between_trump/,17.0,1459297973.0,"I think that many people have not made enough of a comparison between these two men, instead focusing on George Wallace as Trump's predecessor, but there are some striking similarities between these two men.

**Silent majority**: Both men have used the term to appeal to voters who feel they do not have a voice. In Nixon's case, it was those who did not protest the war and in Trump's case it's the people who feel they have been harmed by immigration and free trade deals.

**Treatment of protesters**: Just as Trump has incited violence in his rallies and has said at times that he'd like to punch protesters in the face, Nixon also urged violence upon protesters, but in a more private manner. In 1970, New York union construction workers beat up anti-war protestors, [wounding 70 people](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/05/09/80020635.html?pageNumber=1), and Nixon [praised](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E7DD1538EE34BC4F51DFB366838B669EDE) them. He even wore a hard hat as symbol of his support. Then he made John Brennan, the union's leader, his Secretary of Labor. In 1969, then-Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst mused to a journalist about opening [""detention camps""](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19700712&id=zz0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PygEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7343,189372&hl=en) for antiwar protesters. In 1970 Nixon personally approved a [plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huston_Plan) for burglary and illegal surveillance targeting protesters.

**Hatred of media**: Trump hates all journalists who cover him negatively and has said multiple times that reporters are disgusting people and that he wants to open up libel laws. Nixon, during his presidency, went even further. He had a list of enemies which included journalists and he sent FBI agents to harass many of them. Nixon took things a bit further with columnist and [muckraker Jack Anderson](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/books/2000/0001.feldstein.html), upon whom he blamed his 1960 loss. (Anderson published a column about a ""loan"" Nixon's brother received from the billionaire Howard Hughes shortly before the election.) Nixon's team actually considered putting a hit out on Anderson and they sent CIA agents after him. They planned drugging Anderson with LSD, poisoning his aspirin bottle, staging a fatal mugging. When that failed, they tried to plant false evidence that he was gay or trying to get him drunk before the show started (that failed because he was a teetotaler).

**Dirty tricks**: We all know about Nixon here, but it isn't just a coincidence that one of Trump's main political consultants over the years is Roger Stone, a person who worked for Nixon and even has a tattoo of him. The National Enquirer story seems very likely to have been a stunt by Trump to discredit Cruz and the only person cited in that story is Roger Stone.

**Both men liked each other**: Even though it may seem strange that both men could have had some relationship, Nixon actually did send [this](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/08/us/08firstdraft-trumpnixon/08firstdraft-trumpnixon-tmagArticle.jpg) letter to Trump in 1987. It says:

""Dear Donald,

I did not see the program, but Mrs. Nixon told me that you were great on the Donahue Show.

As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!

With warm regards,

Sincerely, RMN""

Trump, in a 1990 book, said: ''I've seen some real killers in my line of work, but Richard Nixon makes them look like babies. The man is a rock, like him or not.''

**Secret plan to end war**: Trump says he has plan to defeat ISIS but provides no details. Nixon also said he had a plan to end the war in Vietnam, but it turned out there was no plan and the war continued for four more years.

There are other similarities you can think, such as the emphasis of both men on law and order and also their Southern Strategy. Both were not from the South, but managed to win it by using a lot of dog whistles.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

Maybe Congress could learn from Sparky's Alligator Song and see that their dog (the NSA and CIA) are just casting a big scary shadow on the wall.

Maybe Obama's Internet Policy Task Force could benefit from learning about 'One of these things is not like the other' so they could see that rape, murder, and streaming a video are not all the same thing.

Maybe we could even inject some tolerance and empathy into conservative politicians? Yeah... probably not. But it's worth trying, isn't it?

122,A little bit of perspective on the Edward Snowden case.,0.0,1gdp39,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gdp39/a_little_bit_of_perspective_on_the_edward_snowden/,4.0,1371264977.0,"I'm an American, and I've been very disappointed and frustrated with my fellow citizens' reaction to the ""scandal"" that has erupted because of the leaked information by a former NSA contractor. I wish very much that the U.S. Government was better at explaining exactly what NSA does, though part of the problem is it is really damn tough to explain to someone why you can't tell them something without telling them so much that it defeats the purpose of you not telling them in the first place. That is a real sticky wicket in a democracy. 

There has been quite a bit of talk of Edward Snowden as a ""traitor"", and I'm not sure that label quite fits. On the other hand, there have been plenty of people that call him a ""whistleblower"" and a ""hero"", which is probably even less true. Snowden is an IT contractor that came across something that scared him. It scared him because he didn't understand it. The truth is, if you want to assign an overly simplified classification to the man ""dumb-ass"" probably fits the bill better than anything. His mistake was that he forgot that the ability to collect something and actually collecting it is not the same thing. I suppose I can't really blame him too much, because it seems that half of America can't either. 

I ask you to simply consider the following: If you ran a signals intelligence agency, even an evil one, would you allow a password resetter from IT to task email addresses and phone numbers in your SIGINT system? This is what he is claiming he could do. He said in the taped interview that he could tap the President's phone with ease. Now, unless you subscribe to a theory that the president is merely a patsy figurehead (and I recognize that some people do think that), do you think that the head of a mass data-mining operation would allow his on comms to be collected? It isn't so much that Snowden is lying, I actually think he really believes these things are true., it is that he is a low level contractor with delusions of graduer who doesn't understand what the hell is going on amongst the collectors and analysts. 

The second point I'd like you to do, is to look at the document that he chose to (allegedly) exfiltrate from a secure facility. It's a powerpoint document. A powerpoint document. Really. Now, if you truly believed that the NSA had a covert, mass-scale data mining operation that threatened American democracy, and you were willing to give up your life to disclose that, don't you think you'd get, I don't know, a screen shot of the program itself? A directive from DIRNSA? An incriminating email from your department head? Instead, what he provided was simply a presentation that said that a certain program existed. Now, that is plenty good enough to shoot that program to shit in the blink of an eye, but where does it say that this briefing slide that this program is being used against American citizens? It doesn't, because it isn't. The NSA is a signals intelligence service that provides foreign intelligence to the U.S. Government. If ever there was a secret program to catch you looking at goat porn, you would find it in the FBI, not the NSA. 

Which brings me to my next point, and this is one that I'm absolutely shocked at the incredible naiveté of the American people. Just because a government (or corporation, person, baseball team, chess club...) has the capability to do something, does not mean that are USING THAT CAPABILITY! For example: there is a group of men in my town that could, with ease, kick down my door and murder me with their guns, and there is nothing I could do to stop them. It isn't a gang, it's the police department. I could be illegally arrested by the FBI, spied on by the CIA, shanked in the back by a crack head at the ATM. Guess what all these things have in common? They are illegal! So too would it be if the NSA was data mining everyone's computers to check up on anything that you were doing that might make you an enemy of the state (a movie which, contrary to popular belief, is not a documentary on NSA operations). 

Now, if you feel uncomfortable that all these things are true, you are not alone. I don't really like it either. The sad truth is that everything from allowing police officers to carry guns, to keeping a standing army, to creating an intelligence service that operates in secret, is a tradeoff between total personal freedom (called anarchy) and no personal freedom (authoritarianism). It is a totally legit and fair point of view to say ""hey, I just don't like that such a capability exists, maybe we shouldn't allow it"". That is totally fair. What drive me crazy (and led me to write this), is when I see people all over the place (and reddit is one of the very worst offenders here) screaming ""Oh my god, the government has an intelligence capability, we are being watched! It's a police state! Big brother is watching!"" No, the government is not watching, your computer pornography collections and on the side girlfriends are of no concern to them. Instead, their eyes are faced outward looking at the very real, and very scary threats to American (and allied) national security. This includes terrorism (which frankly I've always thought was a bit overblown, but you can thank the American people for collectively peeing their post 9/11 pants for that, but that's another story), but it also includes threats from some not so nice countries that would like very much to see very nasty things happen to the U.S. (and her allies, for all of you living in NATO land). 

That lead me to my final point. The NSA is the largest, most advanced, and best funded signals intelligence organization in the world. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU THINK THEY WERE DOING? Seriously people, if I found out the NSA COULDN'T hack into my email, I'd be freaking pissed. Not that I want them to do it, but for the money that is spent, you'd have to be pretty damned naive to think they couldn't. 

Look people, there is ABSOLUTELY some very crucial questions to be asked about who watches the watchers and exactly what policies we want when it comes to discerning those who can be survailed upon as legitimate targets for foreign signals intelligence, but I promise you, you are not moving the ball forward on any of these questions but making ""OMGZORZ, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING"" memes, or talking about this dumb idiot Snowden as if he's fucking Ralph Nader reborn. Frankly, if more Americans started actually paying attention to these kinds of things (without shitting their pants and shrieking like teenage girls), then perhaps we could have a decent, functioning goddamn government and deal with some of the actual government abuses that exist (like the REAL scandal of warrantless wiretapping being pushed by the executive branch not ten years ago). I'm begging you reddit, please, in the name of scumbag Steve and Success Kid, for god's sake, stop beatifying this slap nuts and get back to advice animals. Or a more nuanced political debate about the role of government. That would be fine too.

I posted this today.  Please read through and give me your feedback!

First off I'm a red blooded, gun totin' self proclaimed redneck, if u r my friend on here u should already know that! Are you as pissed off as I am at your ""govenment by, of and for the people""? If you're not.......shame on you! I'm just putting this out there to see the response I get, if u know me you know i'm far from politically correct!

It's painfully obvious that experience in government isn't working especially when the people we vote in (in comparison to our bank accounts) are LOADED and are more interested in protecting their bottom line than the citizens of this once great nation. ( I say that meaning that we are not as great as we were once percieved by other nations)

I've been saying for years this country needs a leader who is young, blue collar, knows what its like to live paycheck to paycheck and may not be the obvious choice. We need someone with a backbone to say damnit enough is enough! I believe that a hand up is great because everyone needs a hand from time to time, but its time for the HAND OUTS to stop! You want government assistance thats fine prove u deserve it and pass a piss test!

I also believe our current tax system is archaic and is designed to benefit the wealthy and screw the middle/lower class! It's time to trade that system in for one that will benefit EVERYONE including the government!

I believe that it shouldn't mater who you love or want to marry as long as you love and are happy! I mean c'mon people the world is changing every day stop diggin your heels in and just roll w it!

One of two hot topics......guns.......we have the right to bear arms and defend our homes but with that right comes the responsibility as individuals and as a nation to make sure we teach the younger generations the pros and cons of our right to bear arms and to train them responsible gun use. I agree that you will NEVER get everyone on tge same page on this issue but if we allow our government to take our guns away we are no better than the british (whose ass we stomped a mud hole in 200 plus years ago for our very freedoms that are being infringed upon)!

Now on to the privacy issues.....the NSA, FBI, CIA and any other acronymed govt agency that listens in......get the fuck out of my phone and stop eavesdroppin you nosy gossipy fuckers! I mean I understand if there is probable cause but other than that.....access DENIED!

Last topic I will cover(if i've held your attention this long you are my people)

Foreign policy..........it's pretty damn simple, we have enough of our own fucking problems here without having to deal with yours! By saying thay I mean Team America World Police is retired, i'm tired of hearing about soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines dying to ""protect"" our freedoms they aren't dying to protect our freedoms, they are dying to protect Washington's political interests and being a veteran (US Navy and Army National Guard) it makes me very, very Angry!

If you agree with me then i'm your guy lets start a campaign to have the first non-partisan president voted on by write in vote!

My qualifications;

Over the age of 35
American citizen
Military veteran 13 years of service
Fed up with current system
Years of practice living paycheck to paycheck

I seriously doubt it will work but it will be interesting to see how much support I get and how many Angry Americans there are out there!

I'm aware that Clinton brought in her own people to install and maintain the server, but was there really nobody at the state dept. noticed this was happening, capable of pointing it out? Do they not have a network administrator or someone similar who would have noticed that the secretary of state *wasn't* using their secure system? 

Furthermore, aren't we supposed to have cybersecurity officials and intelligence agencies whose job includes counter-intelligence and upkeeping information security? Where were these people on this? How is it possible for the nation's top diplomat to be sending unsecured sensitive communications and the NSA, CIA, White House, or any other agency charged with keeping secrets simply *not be aware*?

I could feel the rant bubbling up from within me.

First off, lets get one thing straight; the fact that Petraeus is no longer Director of the CIA does not mean he will not have to testify regarding his testimony on the Benghzai incident. [He is testifying tomorrow morning](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/14/petraeus-testify-congress/1704197/). This whole ideas that somehow the president has silenced him or thrown him under the bus to cover something up doesn't make sense; he will still be required, under oath, to account for his statements. We could debate the validity or plausibility of his claims another time - and we will, when he testifies to them to congress. Petraeus is also far from the only person who will be held accountable for the administration's initial position, so the idea that the president has somehow dodged the bullet is both uninformed and ludicrous. To any conspiracy theorists out there, do 5 minutes of research not at the Huffington Post or Fox News before crying wolf next time please.

Second, I think the article, and much of the coverage, is confused about why Petraeus had to resign. People in Washington have affairs. People know they have affairs. Noone really cares. The article, somewhat ambitiously assuming that because the FBI and CIA are often rivals, each department is constantly digging for dirt in the personal email archives of each other's leadership, asks, if its quite possible many knew Petraeus was having an affair, why this did not blow up until now. Petraeus was not fired for having an affair; he was fired because his affair got out and caused a whole bunch of mess. Sleep with whoever you want, the FBI and the President don't care. But if the person you're sleeping with then begins threateningly harassing a third woman she thinks you're having an affair with and then that person begins a criminal investigation into your affair, I hope you can see how that's a bit different. Yes, people in the FBI, and the administration, probably knew. But they didn't care; they had their own mistresses to worry about. But Petraeus went from a private fling to criminal scandal. Not cool. Its not a morality play; as Glenn Close once said ""You're a man. You cheat. I get it. But you got caught. You compromised me. I don't know what else to say."" 

Third, I do think there's something to be said, though not something criminal, about the timing of the case. Eric Holder has stated he new there was suspicion of the affair in the spring, when the initial investigation was ongoing. But the FBI had not formally concluded an affair was occurring at the time, claiming to be investigation if the account had been hacked, or if someone was posing as Petraeus. This is probably a good part both truth and fiction; there's a good chance the administration slowed down the passage of information up the chain to avoid revealing before election day. But as it was clear there wasn't any sort of pressing threat to national security, that seems at best underhanded. 

Lastly, I have to say, come on Reason. I know you're libertarian and someone has given you enough money to do whatever the hell you want apparently, but do you have to write like that annoying guy in your junior Political Science class on current events day? The discussion of the new and tricky role of the FBI and CIA in the post 9/11 world is fairly good, though I'm not sure I agree in large part, but its all wrapped in the such juvenile and sensationalist tones: ""In the modern era, office-holders with forgiving spouses simply do not resign from powerful jobs because of a temporary, non-criminal, consensual adult sexual liaison, as the history of the FDR, Eisenhower, JFK, LBJ, and Clinton presidencies attest."" Public exposure for affairs of most of these people didn't come out until decades after they resigned, and are you really going to cite Clinton as evidence that nothing bad happens if your affair is exposed? Not to mention that there are so many cases where people have been forced to resign entirely for having affairs in the last 5 years alone. 

The closing is just precious. First, the article claims that ""All this—the FBI spying on the CIA—constitutes the government attacking itself. Anyone who did this when neither federal criminal law nor national security has been implicated and kept the president in the dark has violated about four federal statutes and should be fired and indicted."" ""About four statutes?"" Really? And does the author really think that Petraeus, in taking his position, did not consent to being investigated over concerns for his operational integrity? Or that the FBI and CIA are somehow prohibited from investigating each other, when domestic counterintelligence is one of the primary roles of the FBI? Have they never heard of Robert Hanssen? And the final: ""No keen observer could believe the government's Pollyanna version of these events. When did the CIA become a paragon of honesty? When did the FBI become a paragon of transparency? When did the government become a paragon of telling the truth?"" So... if the government does anything good ever, that's proof its a lie. Sigh.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

I know it's impossible to fix everything, but that does not mean that we shouldn't try to make it better. Hopefully this will satisfy those people with this notion, which seems to only pervade the American mindset, that everyone is out to get them and they need a gun to protect themselves from the villains.

Also, on a side note, gun advocates who are posting these straw-man arguments about knives and cars being just as dangerous, let me work in the opposite direction for you. Here is a hypothetical which will probably get the CIA watching my every move, so let me type HYPOTHETICAL in big capitalized letters: 
Would it be alright if I was some Fatman-esque bomb advocate? What if I claimed to like bombs and missiles and collected them? What if I wanted the right to carry around a bomb for protection? Would you be alright with that? I mean, it serves the same purpose as a gun: to destroy. Countries use them for protection. I could use them to hunt and fish. So tell me, what makes it different?

That aside, here are some of my proposals:

1. Gun ownership is limited to those who use it for sport, hunting, and antique collection.

2. No automatics or semi-automatics

3. A gun limit of five per registered household.

4. Said owners must register said weapons after undergoing a rigorous background check.

5. And this is my favorite: Bullets must undergo the same regulations of ownership in order to limit the ammunition which makes its way to unregistered weapons.

6. All current registered gun ownerships are reevaluated in order to coincide with the specific measures given in rule 1.

7. All registered gun owners are to have their guns inspected every number of years to insure they are not selling their guns to unregistered buyers

8. Any missing, lost, or stolen gun is to be immediately reported to police or face fines or jail time when they fail to re-register said gun.

9. All removed guns are offered a monetary reimbursement.

10. Monetary reimbursement is offered to all non-registered gun owners upon turning in their weapons.

11. A tax increase on weapons, bullets, and yearly payments for registered gun ownership which will go to the reimbursement plan.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

134,Nelson Mandela was a major human rights icon. However do you think his relationship and friendship with authoritarian leaders was a good or bad thing?,0.0,uswd95,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/uswd95/nelson_mandela_was_a_major_human_rights_icon/,53.0,1652938644.0,"Nelson Mandela is of course remembered a great human rights leader and icon who struggled against apartheid. During the course of this however he developed friendships and connections with leaders across the political spectrum. This included authoritarian leaders such as Fidel Castro, Muammar Gaddafi and Suharto from Indonesia which caused controversy during his life time. These were developed both because of the complicated politics of the anti apartheid movement, as well as the complicated politics of the post apartheid period. Let me break it down.

**Fidel Castro:**

* The setting for this was as follows. The Cuban Revolution has just taken place in 1959. The Apartheid government has engaged in the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960. The ANC, Nelson Mandela's party, has engage in a campaign of nonviolent protests since their inception for 50 years against segregation and apartheid. Each time they keep getting shot down. So the Youth league of the ANC lead by Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and others decide that armed resistance was a viable option. Nelson Mandela sends Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo to ask for assistance from the United States. The Eisenhower Administration is in its waning days. They decline, due to the fact that Apartheid South Africa is a U.S ally for Cold War purposes. In fact, later on the CIA would assist in Mandela's capture. They then send representatives to Cuba and Fidel Castro immediately says yes to assisting. Later on in 1961 ANC members begin reading Che Guevara's writings on guerilla warfare so that they can engage in armed resistance against the apartheid regime.
* Cuba would later on send not only advisors but its actually military to engage in war with the apartheid government in areas such as Namibia and Angola. During these conflicts the ANC's armed wing would often go to the training campaigns the Cuban forces set up so they could engage in their armed resistance against the apartheid regime and also participated in battles the Cuban armed forces engaged in with the apartheid government.
* After apartheid ended Nelson Mandela decided to maintain ties with Cuba and Castro. Part of it was a friendship that developed where they became very close. Part of it was social. In the post apartheid situation in South Africa was one where they experienced a brain drain, which included doctors. The sought Cuba's help with its medical internationalism to help train a new generation of doctors as well as given medical assistance to poor neighbours in the townships of South Africa. On Cuba's part they oblidged because of the economic problems they experienced in their special period and the need for income.
* Because of these complicated factors Mandela came to see Castro as a great revolutionary and praised him often, which caused controversy of course. He even awarded him one of South Africa's top honours in 1998.

**Gaddafi**

* Just like Castro, this stemmed from the anti apartheid struggle. During the period of decolonisation, North African states such as Algeria, Libya and Egypt became social hubs for revolutionary activity and the ANC sent representatives, including Mandela himself, to these areas to seek assistance for their struggle. He first got assistance from Ahmed Ben Bella's anti colonial government in Algeria, and later on when Mandela was in prison the ANC got assistance from Gaddafi. Because of these circumstances they developed a very controversial relationship which Mandela refused to break from.
* In the post apartheid period Mandela maintained this relationship but the reasons are somewhat interesting. Part of it again was just a loyality to those who helped him. Part of it though was to play the role of a mediator. Gaddafi's Libya was under international sanctions for both financing terrorism as well as their nuclear weapons program. But the sanctions were causing a humanitarian crisis. Mandela wanted to find a way to get the sanctions lifted to end the humanitarian crisis. One was essentially to maintain ties with Gaddafi as a way to connect with him. Which was controversial. He would repeatedly remind Gaddafi of his contributions to the anti apartheid struggle and even went as far as naming one of his grandsons after Gaddafi. Eventually because of this controversy Gaddafi ended up handing over to the international community those accused of terrorism for trial and also began to initiate the process of ending his WMDS program. In exchange sanctions slowly began to be removed so that humanitarian assistance could be sent.
* A third reason for the maintenance of this friendship was because Mandela and the ANC were strongly pushing the Treaty of Pelindaba. It was a treaty that essentially made Africa a nuclear weapons free zone. This treaty was for Nelson Mandela what the Iran Nuclear Agreement was for Obama. In order for it to work they needed many of the states on the African continent to sign on. This included the North African states like Libya and Algeria. They initially refused unless Israel gave up its own nuclear weapons. However, because of historic friendships Mandela helped persuade Gaddafi and the Algerian political leadership. This was part of the ANC governments general anti nuclear push which at the same time resulted in the permanent extension of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
* One interesting sticking point where their ties almost got severed during the anti apartheid struggle was over the Jewish community. There were many Jewish activists from South Africa in the anti apartheid struggle. And many happen to be strong supporters of Israel. Gaddafi, because of his antisemitism, insisted that the Jewish presence from the anti apartheid movement be removed and that if it wasn't, he would not allow the ANC to open offices in Libya. Mandela and the ANC refused saying that members of the Jewish community were comrades in arms. Because of this a diplomatic office by the ANC was not opened in Libya until 1990, when Gaddafi surprisingly backed down and accepted the Jewish community as part of the anti apartheid movement.

I can't go through all of the other controversial friendships but the gist is this. He formed this controversial alliances because of circumstances during the anti apartheid struggle where he had little else to turn. He himself addressed this by comparing it to the allies in WWII turning forming an alliance with Stalin and the Soviets to fight Hitler. Then in the post apartheid period he maintained these friendships for a complicated set of reasons. Part of it was because of his stubborn belief in being loyal to those who helped you and seeing the best in people. Mandela was controversially loyal to people across the global ideological spectrum from the Queen, to Bill Clinton, to the Conservative leaders in Canada, to leaders like Castro and Gaddafi. And part of it was using those friendship as leverage to push diplomatic breakthroughs whether it was the Lockerbie case, getting sanctions lifted on Libya, or solidifying Africa as a nuclear free zone.

On August 6th 2001, GW Bush received an intelligence briefing in the Oval Office warning of an imminent major terrorist attack on American soil involving hijacking commercial airliners and using them as ""flying bombs"". See 1.

They tried to warn us. 

Known Foreign Intelligence warnings in the months leading up to the attacks. 

http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/main/foreignwarnings.html 

Other countries warning of this imminent terrorist attack include :-

the UK

Germany

Jordan

Russia

Israel

Egypt

France

On top of these warnings from foreign countries, the CIA and FBI also had extensive intelligence of their own of an imminent major terrorist attack.

Why was no action taken to beef up basic airport security in the face of so much intelligence?

Why was no action taken to beef up the ""over 70 lines of FBI enquiry""?

Why were FBI investigations prior to 9/11 called off?

How could anyone NOT step up airport security in the face of so many warnings and SO MUCH intel? 

This was why the CIA guys were apoplectic and wanted a transfer out of the Counter Terrorism branch as per this NYT article 

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html 

And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have “dramatic consequences,” including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but “will occur soon.” Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. 

Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. 

2. Buildings do not collapse at free fall speed of their own accord 

The twin towers collapsed at free fall speed (as near as makes no difference).

This is evidenced by detailed video footage and seismic data.

Buildings cannot collapse at free fall speed without some kind of controlled demolition.

Why was the fact that the buildings collapsed at free fall speed excluded from the contents of the 9/11 commission report?

How were the controlled demolition charges placed on the steel beams in the twin towers?

We know there was ""maintenance"" work in the weeks prior to 9/11 which allowed access to the steel beams.

Who set off the charges for the controlled demolition?

Building 7 was ordered to be pulled down by Rudy Giuliani.

This building also fell at free fall speed from a controlled demolition.

The controlled demolition charges were in place before 9/11 (there was not enough time to place them in the building on 9/11 itself).

The BBC reported on Live TV, that Building 7 had collapsed while the building was still standing (you can see building 7 still standing behind the reporter).

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s

How did the BBC know that building 7 was going to be pulled before it happened?

We know that there were explosions immediately prior to the buildings collapse; and several injuries from those explosions; in the basements of the twin towers.

Why was this evidence not included in the 9/11 commission report?

Why were the eye witnesses to these explosions not called to testify?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhGcBxONSvc

3. Why were the steel beams from the twin towers smuggled out of the country within 2 weeks of 911? 

Never before in history has a skyscraper collapsed just from fire.

The buildings were designed to withstand the impact from up to 6 aircraft simultaneously, only 1 aircraft hit each tower.

Jet fuel only burns at about 700 degrees C.

Temperatures of 1200 degrees C are required to weaken steel.

You would of thought that the American government would be anxious to know why the buildings collapsed when they had been designed to withstand the impact from multiple aircraft.

Why were samples of the steel beams not sent to every major research facility, of major universities, in the US to understand what had gone wrong and to prevent such a disaster from ever happening again?

Why were the steel beams smuggled out of the country very quickly to prevent this from being done?

4. 7 out of 10 of the 9/11 commissioners now disagree with the contents of the official 9/11 report. 

The report's author is particularly scathing

The Attorney General (John Farmer) who drafted the 9/11 report for the 9/11 commission now says that the report is based on government lies and is almost entirely untrue.

(CINCINNATI, Ohio) - In John Farmer’s book: “The Ground Truth: The Story Behind America’s Defense on 9/11″, the author builds the inescapably convincing case that the official version... is almost entirely untrue...

The 9/11 Commission now tells us that the official version of 9/11 was based on false testimony and documents and is almost entirely untrue. The details of this massive cover-up are carefully outlined in a book by John Farmer, who was the Senior Counsel for the 9/11 Commission.

Farmer, Dean of Rutger Universities' School of Law and former Attorney General of New Jersey, was responsible for drafting the original flawed 9/11 report.

Does Farmer have cooperation and agreement from other members of the Commission? Yes. Did they say Bush ordered 9/11? No. Do they say that the 9/11 Commission was lied to by the FBI, CIA, Whitehouse and NORAD? Yes. Is there full documentary proof of this? Yes.

Farmer states...“at some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened... I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The [Norad air defense] tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. This is not spin.”

5. The 270 degree turn and rapid descent of the aircraft that hit the Pentagon. 

Experienced pilots have testified that they could not of made such a manoevre.

How could a very inexperienced pilot with only very limited flight training have accomplished it?

The official account of the attack on the Pentagon has many flaws, the above is just one of them.

The attack on the Pentagon needs to be re-investigated.

6. Condoleezza Rice's statement that no one could of expected terrorists to hijack aircraft and use them as weapons is an obvious and blatant lie 

See 1 above of the numerous foreign intelligence and diplomatic warnings that this was exactly what was being planned and the American government knew it, prior to 9/11.

Conclusions 

The events leading up to and the events on the actual day of 9/11 need to be properly investigated.

The official account is a complete cover up and a pack of lies.

Charges need to be brought against those responsible for the murder of 3,000 people on 9/11.

The easiest way of moving this forward is to bring civil charges against members of the Bush/Cheney regime for Gross Negligence on behalf of one or more of the foreign families that were a victim of 9/11.

There are plenty of countries to choose from, e.g. Brazil

Sue for gross negligence by members of the Bush regime for doing nothing to stop the attacks succeeding, in the face of overwhelming diplomatic and intelligence warnings of an impending terrorist attack using aircraft/airliners.

The burden of proof is lower in a civil court.

If members of the Bush regime chose not to appear and defend themselves the jury is entitled to draw their own conclusions from that in a civil court (in most countries).


There are plenty of countries to choose from to launch an initial case on behalf of the family of at least one of the foreign nationals killed on 9/11.

More countries could then follow suit.

There are plenty of countries to choose from to launch this initial case.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks 

Upon completion of successful civil suits, further criminal charges can be brought - up to and including murder for those who were behind the 9/11 attacks.

N.B. aiding and abetting murder is the same as murder in the eyes of the Law.

I say ""probably don't"" because I've seen eyewitness testimony that at least on the surface is compelling, and it's hard to prove a negative. Also, scientists are continually discovering new species. Still, scores of cryptozoologists have ""hunted"" these animals for years and have yet to turn up any hard evidence of their existence.

But isn't it kind of fun to believe in them? The same way it's fun to believe in ghosts, UFO's, and physic phenomena--or at least entertain the possibility. It just makes the world a more interesting place. And in the same neighborhood, maybe just door or two down, is the belief in conspiracy theories.

It's fun to picture a world full of shadow organizations; nefarious groups of puppet-masters in our government and elsewhere meeting in secret chambers, discussing ways to enslave us while performing bizarre rituals. It's good entertainment. It's even more intriguing because those who believe get to be a part of it. They have a role, if only as the person in the know--one who has had their eyes opened and is privy to that which most citizens aren't, and therefore able to help save humanity and fight against it.

But therein lies the danger; it's really easy to get sucked into this sort of thing and start taking it all way too seriously, especially if one has paranoid tendencies. In my occupation, I work with a lot of mentally ill people, and their delusions often have to do with the CIA, the FBI, the Free-Masons, the Illuminati. And where did they get these ideas?

Now, before I go on, let me say; I don't trust the government unquestioningly. We have been lied to before. The government is made up of people, and people lie. And conspiracies have happened. The Gulf of Tonkin really happened. Watergate happened. The recent bridge incident in New Jersey happened, and that was a conspiracy. Not a huge or elaborate one, but a conspiracy nonetheless.  

But conspiracy theorists take a huge leap beyond what we know and what is reasonable and see a conspiracy and a hidden agenda behind everything. Any time there is a mass shooting it's a false flag operation by our government to them. They refuse to even entertain the possibility that maybe a disturbed non-government citizen decided to commit an atrocity for whatever insane reason. No, that's too simple. It was the government.  It's foolish to assume that everyone or even the vast majority of elected officials are malevolent by nature.  That sort of thinking is what leads to actually totalitarian, evil regimes.

Too bad this evil government is always so sloppy, because they seem to leave clues obvious to ""those who really know what's going on"" scattered all over the place whenever they pull one of their deeds. They really need to learn to cover their tracks better.

That exhaust leaving airplanes? Not just a byproduct of the fuel planes consume. No, those are contrails, spraying us all with secret chemicals designed to do some sort of damage to our minds. Vaccinations? An honest attempt by doctors to eradicate and protect children from disease? Please, don't be such a sheeple. More ways to pump our bodies full of mind-altering substances that will make us easier to enslave, so don't vaccinate your kids. Oh, and that smallpox, measles, mumps, etc. are coming back as a result is a small price to pay.

Where conspiracy theorists hook people is by starting with a small bit of truth, then taking it in a wild direction. But that direction is usually an easy to follow narrative that makes sense. It's actually not at all hard to make something sound believable. I once saw a mock documentary on Mermaids, of all things, but it was so well done in a believable, pseudo-scientific way, that I actually started to get sucked into it before I figured out that I was watching fiction. Others had the same reaction, even calling the Navy, outraged at their atrocities towards these cousins of ours.

There are several radio/Internet gurus that espouse these theories that people follow. They convince people that they can't trust the government, but they can trust THEM, because they've figured it all out and have their best interests at heart. And if you'll send them $19.95, they'll send you their DVD explaining everything to you. You HAVE to watch this; you and your families future depends on it. Otherwise, just be a sheeple, but then don't complain when you end up getting shuffled off a FEMA camp at the end of a rifle by a jacked booted, federal thug.

Conspiracy theories aren't exclusive to one particular political philosophy. However, they seem to be most prevalent on the extreme right, especially among libertarians and Tea Party types, and they've even seeped somewhat into the mainstream right. After all, several popular conspiracy theories concern a certain president named Obama who they really don't tend to care much for. He's really a Kenyan, he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. His wife is actually a man.
And here is where the danger starts becoming real. These sort of conspiracy theories are strongly tied with an extreme anti-government view. People who believe that revolution is upon us and that it may be time for an armed insurrection against the Feds. When Cliven Bundy refused to pay grazing fees for letting his cattle use federal land because he ""doesn't recognize the federal government as existing,"" an armed, self-appointed militia came to his defense. These men were ready to shoot federal officers just trying to do their jobs, because they are ""tyrants,"" you see.

As of this writing, these men are still there. They are comical because they take themselves so seriously, but this is also what makes them dangerous. They have set up checkpoints and have stopped and harassed citizens, making them prove that they are residents of the area. They are so invested in their fantasies about themselves and the federal government that they are making it other peoples' problems and trampling on their rights, apparently missing the irony of it all. If they were to actually get their way and overthrow the government, we are getting a nice sneak preview of the new tyranny we will be subjected to, and it'll be ten times worse than what we already have.  What do you think will become of anyone who they deem to not be a ""freedom loving patriot?""  

There are real problems and legitimate concerns that this country is facing. Worrying about men in the woods worshiping an owl statue is just a distraction. An entertaining distraction, but a distraction nonetheless.",PoliticalDiscussion,CIA

While the eventually White House admitted their error, they have maintained that the talking points were made at the time with the intelligence service's input and consent. Thus began the alleged coverup that's worse than crime.

142,the absurdity of conspiracy theories,0.0,18p48l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18p48l/the_absurdity_of_conspiracy_theories/,21.0,1361120799.0,"Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?  Scientific American recently summarized studies indicating that conspiracy theorists fail to think with logical consistency, instead tending to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously.  Some psychologists have gone further, suggesting conspiracy theorists are paranoid, schizophrenic, etc.

My intention here is to outline the general pattern of a conspiracy theory, give an illustrative example, and expose the common fallacies involved.  I think we can agree that a conspiracy theory has three common characteristics:  (1) *Multiple people in positions of power collaborating with an intent to deceive.*  Often the paranoids imagine these players to be so highly placed, up to and including the US President, the UK Prime Minister, etc., it is ludicrous.  The machinations of these nefarious leaders frequently involve the wholesale slaughter of thousands of innocent human lives.  As wikipedia summarizes, a ""conspiracy theory"" is ""a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end"".  (2)  *Many confederates who are complicit with the conspiracy, or at least play the role of useful idiots.*  Often the sheer number of these players, typically in the government and the mass media, is implausible to the extreme.  It is of course not in human nature to simply go along with leaders without question or morality.
(3)  *A populace evidently too dense to see through any of the above.*

By way of example, it is roughly the tenth anniversary of a conspiracy theory that, I am dismayed to report, still has many adherents.   I am referring to the theory that a cabal within the US government misled its own citizenry and the rest of the world in regards to the threat posed by Iraq, particularly Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, for the purpose of instigating an unjust war.  It is not hard to see how this paranoid fantasy fits the pattern outlined above.

Regarding the intent to deceive, as a general rule we should always first consider Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice that which one might conceivably attempt to explain with stupidity.  This is of course not a mere suggestion, but an actual axiom of life.  However, it does not apply in our particular case, for not only is malice out of the question, of course, but stupidity can also be ruled out.

The decision to go to war is, after all, the most important decision a nation can make.  In order to double check its justification for war, the Bush administration formed the Office of Special Plans, the sincerity of which is now legendary.  They also consulted Iraqi informants who were, already at that time, well-known for their truthfulness -- internationally renowned, in fact -- men such as Ahmed Chalabi and Khidir Hamza.  Do not impugn these men of integrity!

And the Bush administration also consulted with the CIA, to make sure they were on the right track.  Now the conspiracy theorists have alleged that, rather than being consulted, the CIA was instead being pressured to come to a foregone conclusion.  But if that were truly the case, then why didn't CIA analysts leak complaints about this state of affairs to the press on, say, March 23, 2003?

The Bush administration then helpfully passed on their valuable intelligence to UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.  Now, again, if they didn't have valid intelligence to offer on Iraqi WMD, but instead were merely pressuring Blix to follow their agenda, why didn't Blix ever complain about this situation?  

The tinfoil hat crowd goes even further, and alleges that the key piece of evidence the US had for Iraq's nuclear weapon program was in fact fake.  That was the contention of former diplomat Joseph Wilson, after looking into the matter.  But of course we know Wilson was motivated purely by partisan politics.  If the evidence that Iraq procured weapons-grade uranium from Niger was really so questionable, the CIA would have warned Bush prior to his State of the Union Address referencing this evidence on January 28, 2003.  Given this hypothesized warning, then, the implication is that Bush lied -- an unprecedented act of any sitting US president of course.  The gall of these truthers knows no bounds. 

If the Niger document was really a forgery, it would have been publicly exposed as such by the International Atomic Energy Agency, with a report to that effect made accessible on www.un.org by, say, March 7, 2003.  And of course, if that had actually happened, the press would have a field day, and the US government would have immediately halted its buildup to war to investigate and re-assess its evidence.  From the fact that this did not occur, we can of course infer that the document must be authentic.  But conspiracy theorists are not logical like you or me.

The conspiracy theorists instead maintain that the US government and the press  largely ignored the ""fact"" that the Niger document was a forgery.  But think of the sheer number of people who would have to go along with this!  It's preposterous of course.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  If Iraq really had no WMD capability, this would have been known by the former chief UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who operated on the ground in Iraq through the late 1990's.  Why, then, didn't Ritter alert the media and demand an audience with senators?  Or perhaps he did, but was marginalized?  You see, paranoids can always come up with rationalizations to maintain their delusions.

Even worse, the mainstream news media is accused by the paranoids not just of selective reporting, but of actively reporting misleading stories on Iraqi WMD.  But surely if the disconnect between the press and reality became so obviously extreme, papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post would eventually be forced to issue public apologies just to maintain some appearance of journalistic integrity?  

Finally, for such a hypothetical conspiracy to be successful, the average citizen would have to be too dumb to catch on (for at least long enough to support the war effort).  Now, in the alternate reality of the conspiracy theorist, former weapons inspector Scott Ritter tried to inform the public of the absence of WMD in Iraq, not to mention that the IAEA publicly exposed the evidence for Iraq's nuclear weapons program as fraudulent, and meanwhile no tangible evidence for Iraqi WMD was found.  Yet, according to national polls conducted by Gallup, Pew, and other organizations just before and well after the war began, the majority of the US population believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  (Similarly, a majority of the astute American population believed that Iraq had ties to the 9/11 attacks, and that war with Iraq was justified.)  Why, that would  imply that the majority of Americans do not exercise critical thinking!  It's a dark and twisted world inhabited by the conspiracy theorist.  I wouldn't want to live there.  Would you?  (Conspiracy nuts, on the other hand, are mainly motivated by the satisfaction of believing themselves to be smarter than others, according to expert Michael Barkun, Ph.D.)

tl;dr:  Men do not conspire behind closed doors.  Weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq.  To believe otherwise is madness.

2: IRS: This one is laughable. Groups with political names (Tea *Party*) are probed for political agendas while applying for tax exempt status? The problem is with the 501-c4 law.

 a) The Associated Press did not uncover allegations by a whistle blower or expose wrongdoing. If that were the case, they should be protected.

CNN was showing a story about the capture of Abu Khatallah, the alleged mastermind of the Benghazi attack.  A former CIA operative explained in great detail why it was much easier for a member of the media to be able to interview Abu Khatallah than for a team of US military forces to safely capture him.  

A media interview would take place on ""his turf.""  He would dictate the time and place of the interview.  The interviewer would be frisked for weapons.  They would be surrounded by his security forces who could easily kill the interviewer at any moment.  

On the other hand, to safely capture a guy like this, a great deal of work must be done:  months of surveillance, dozens of interviews, learning his daily routine, creating a complete picture of where his security team is at all times, their weapons, their capabilities, and their weaknesses.  After all of this work, they could create a plan that would allow him to be safely grabbed.  And, they did grab him safely -- not a shot fired, no Americans injured.

It was an enlightening story that answered a question I have been wondering about.

Then I flipped over to Fox and Friends.  Steve Doocey was interviewing a Republican congressman who said (paraphrasing here) ""I want to know why the media had no trouble locating Abu Khatallah, but it took us almost two years to capture him!""   No attempt was made to answer his angry question.

1. The first and most significant case is the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in 1975. Allegations of US interference stem from a theory that Whitlam was about the close down US government bases in Australia and investigate CIA influence into Australian politics before his dismissal. The man who dismissed him was a member of a CIA front organisation, an ex DoD contractor claims he saw cables indicating CIA involvement (and was blocked by US courts from leaking them before being jailed). There's also alleged testimony from Whitlam himself that a US government official told him in 1977 that the USA would never interfere in Australian politics again, although Whitlam has claimed there was no US interference.
2. The next case concerns the Nugan Hand Bank as a CIA front for drug and arms trafficking in Southeast Asia until its collapse in 1980. Although a Royal Commission cleared the bank, there's still a lot of suspicious links to the US intelligence community and lingering suspicions.
3. The most recent and most rarely mentioned alleged case of covert US interference was the resignation against Kevin Rudd. Although this is usually blamed on a combination of Rudd angering much of his own party and manipulation of the media by mining companies, one of the main ""power brokers"" in Rudd's political party who apparently led the campaign against him \[Mark Arbib\] was exposed by Wikileaks as a US embassy informant (leading to speculation he was covertly instructed or encouraged to remove him by the US embassy), not to mention statements of anger about Rudd's foreign policy by US government officials.

The government maintains the right to indefinitely detain, torture or even kill me without the due process guaranteed all Americans; so I must be something much worse. 

I frequently use words the CIA, FBI and NSA flag and associate with terrorist such as: freedom, liberty and Constitutional Rights.

In 1973, the US used CIA to back a [fascistic military coup d'etat]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) resulting in thousands of people being killed or executed, over 130,000 were arrested and tens of thousands of people had to flee the country in fear for their lives.  
  
The result was a Chile being run by right wing military dictators under [Augusto Pinochet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet) for 17 years, a fate much much much worse than the puny 9/11/2001 attacks.  
  
So, dear Americans, when you remember 9/11, take some time and remember the havoc your country created in Chile on the same date, almost 30 years earlier. Also remember, these things are why the US is not universally loved around the world as I know you think you should be.

By estimates I've heard, the US killed 2-3 million  Vietnamese people in a war of aggression which was based on false pretenses (the Tet offensive). It committed war crimes, napalming and using Agent Orange on whole villages, causing horrific genetic mutations. To this day we Americans are unable to come terms with Vietnam - at worst it was a ""mistake,"" or we lost because of ""anti-americanism"" at home. The reality is that it was an act of genocide, on par with Pol Pot, Stalin, and Hitler. 

Not to make this all about Vietnam - its just the most striking example of US imperial aggression. You also have the CIA helping overthrow various democratic governments, supporting Suharto in the killing of millions of ""communists"" in Indonesia and East Timor,  creating terrorist death squads in Nicaragua, etc. Chomsky can make the case against US terrorism far better than I can. 

We live under a system of total propaganda, that the US is ""the best"" and ""they hate us for our freedoms."" We all know better than that here, I hope. But what if the US isn't just merely a kinda shitty place, but actually a truly evil nation?

* **Senate Watergate Committee investigation - 406 days**

Summary: Five men were arrested for breaking into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex where phones are found to be wiretapped. The hotel rooms the burglars were staying in were booked by a CIA front company. A $25,000 cashier's check earmarked for the Nixon re-election campaign was found in the bank account of one of the burglars. 

A federal prosecutor requests access to tape recordings between Nixon and his aids about the affair. Nixon has the prosecutor fired.

Nixon refuses to release the tapes and takes the case to the Supreme Court.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Which is what stands out about Benghazi.  

Watergate and Iran/Contra  BEGAN with a crime, and looked into their cover-ups.

Benghazi  BEGAN with 7 investigations that cleared Clinton of any crime, and has spent the last year and a half trying to find one.

No charges have been filed to date.  The investigation is ongoing.",politics,CIA

Of particular importance is Division C, the Strategic Competition Act of 2021, and even more importance on the global stage is Title III: Investing in Our Values.  I'm going to copy-paste the overview (really the table of contents) for this, because the text is too dang long and dense to post altogether, putting in bold some important ones.

4,Russia's Pacific Strategy,445.0,ruegag,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ruegag/russias_pacific_strategy/,142.0,1641144390.0,"With the eyes of the world fixated on Russia’s border with Ukraine, Moscow is beginning to make major moves 7500km to the East on the Russian Pacific coast. Most major powers have already begun their pivot to Asia, and now Russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. Will Russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant China in this theatre? 

With its heartland west of the Ural Mountains, Russia has long been tightly Europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the Indo-Pacific, Moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. These regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the Soviet Era, and aside from hosting Russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in Vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in Moscow since much of Nuclear forces were redeployed to Kola.   
At present Vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the Kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. The Russian *Vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving Russia could rapidly deploy forces to the Pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of Kremlin planners. The exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. The Russian forces have been a predominately Western focused force, and that stokes fears that the Russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the Pacific front continues to gain importance.   

To try and combat this Putin set in motion his own Pivot to Asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the Russian far-east. Little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in Kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

This issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in Russian surface fleets. With 5 fleets to modernise, Russia’s Pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its Baltic, Northern, and even Black Sea fleets meaning that Vladivostok continues to receive the Russian navies leftovers.  Although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia’s hegemony in the region. 

With an ascendant China in the region though is Russia being delegated to a junior partner? We certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between Russian forces and the PLA and PLAN, and in those operations Russia has largely taken a backseat to China in regional issues, such as Korea. The caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still haven’t seen what would happen if China and Russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. The closeness of the Russia-China relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. For the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

The question I would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for Moscow to place the Pacific front on the same priority level as the Northern or Black Sea fronts, and how would Moscow react to a conflict in the South China sea?   
My gut feeling is that Russia would assist China with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in Europe? I am keen to get this subs thoughts though.

7,Contextualizing China/Taiwan Relations and Recent Tensions,377.0,wgodxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/wgodxn/contextualizing_chinataiwan_relations_and_recent/,119.0,1659682225.0,"How many times have we heard the stories about Chinese “incursions” into the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan? How many times has Beijing repeated that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People’s Republic of China and that attempts at separatism are “doomed to fail?”

The concept of an impending war in the Taiwan Straits bears a lot of resemblance to the constant Zerohedge-esque paranoia of an impending war between Pakistan and India over Kashmir (Kashmir is a funny one because it’s going to come up later). I’m going to try and lay out the case for why China isn’t about to invade Taiwan.

**The Status Quo Benefits Both Sides**

The current status quo is one that is very beneficial to both Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan has de-facto, although not de-jure independence from China. Meanwhile, Beijing benefits from inward investment from Taiwanese businesses and also gets to boast that Taiwan isn’t an officially recognized country by any of its adversaries like the US.

We’ve heard constantly from Beijing that any move towards Taiwan declaring de-jure independence will be met by a military invasion of the island. But Taiwan doesn’t need to do that at all. Under the current arrangement, Taiwan has its own judicial system, its own elections, its own currency etc etc. Unlike Hong Kong or Macau, which are Special Administrative Regions with a high degree of autonomy and freedom within China, it is not entirely subservient to the whims of the CCP. Beijing doesn’t have troops stationed in Taiwan, nor can they pass laws which have any meaningful effect on anything happening in Taiwan like they could pass a national security law in Hong Kong which severely restrained the pro-democracy movement. For Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, declaring de-jure independence, which would most definitely cross Beijing’s red line on Taiwan, looks like a play with a concave payoff. She can still go around showing off how the territory has full freedom from Beijing without undertaking that drastic action.

On the business side, Taiwan has accumulated almost $200bn in investment in China. Taiwanese SMEs and large corporations alike create plenty of jobs in China. Unsurprisingly, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner. In 2020, Taiwan’s exports to both Mainland China and Hong Kong amounted to US$151.45bn, accounting for 43.9% of total exports. In short, the ambiguity over Taiwan has benefited both sides, politically and economically.

**The CCP Are Now First and Foremost Ultra-Nationalists, Not Warmongers**

The CCP are more ultra-nationalists than they are communists. It is through improving living standards as well as fervent nationalism and propping up anxiety amongst the public that they have maintained their power. If the Taiwan issue is resolved, what problem will Beijing have to whip up nationalist sentiment against and keep the legitimacy of the CCP alive? A permanent state of anxiety from potential interference from foreign powers restricting the rise of China serves the Party quite well. In this case, that would be the situation in Taiwan. It serves as a great reason for the existence of an extremely strong PLA.

Ever since undergoing the “century of humiliation” between 1839 and 1949, the Chinese Communist Party are hell bent on ensuring that China is respected as a world power. Among many things, the Opium Wars and the Sino-Japanese wars were all things which severely harmed the Chinese nation. During this century of humiliation, China had to cede Hong Kong to the British, Macau to the Portuguese and the island of Taiwan to the Japanese. The subsequent peaceful reunification of both Hong Kong and Macau as Special Administrative Regions under Chinese sovereignty went a long way for Beijing in restoring their dignity. But Taiwan is left still un-unified with the Chinese mainland.

Ever since Xi took power in 2012, he’s turned the Party away from its collectivist leadership during the times of Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin into a one-man party. The Party must maintain a strong stance against Taiwanese independence, not because they’re warmongers, but out of an interest of self-preservation. From cracking down on the separatist movement in Tibet, to putting Muslims in “re-education” camps in Xinjiang to counter the extremist East Turkestan Islamic Movement and implementing a national security law in Hong Kong after the SAR’s failure to implement its own as required by Article 23 of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, Xi has relied on ardent nationalism to maintain national unity. You need a certain level of threat from foreign powers, for example alleged CIA backing of Hong Kong democracy activists, to stir support for a strongman government. “Only the CCP will protect the interests of the Chinese nation” is the message he’s trying to send. The Party is basically a mafia protection racket. Solving the Taiwan issue would mean that the state of collective anxiety amongst the public would no longer be there. The nationalism that binds the country’s different factions together in the face of Taiwan would fade away as there is no problem with China’s “territorial integrity” anymore.

All of this is in the name of the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, or the “China dream” as he’s said countless times. If Beijing looks weak then they’ll lose their legitimacy with the Chinese people. So, constant pressure on Taiwan without actually backing military action seems like a stable status quo. Sounds absolutely crazy, right?

Xi is alleged to have gone off the record and told the KMT (the softly pro-Beijing nationalist party in Taiwan) that accepting a de-jure declaration of independence would lead to the overthrowing of the Chinese government.

However, China’s policy has always been for **peaceful** reunification (resorting to invasion would lead to numerous problems which I will go into later). In the event of a re-unification with the Mainland, it is envisioned by Beijing that Taiwan would not be a standard Mainland province, but a Special Administrative Region. The Taiwan situation is exactly how the “One Country, Two Systems” formula originated. Now, you can talk about the flaws of the system, especially its implementation in Hong Kong, but the point I’m trying to get here is that Beijing is not planning on turning Taipei into a standard Mainland city.

In fact, Beijing still recognises the situation to be different in Taiwan to such an extent that **they’re willing to offer Taiwan control of the military forces on the island**, something which it never has offered nor implemented in Hong Kong or Macau where the control of the PLA garrison falls entirely under the remit of Beijing, in an effort to try and solve some of the evident mistrust that exists between the island of Taiwan and the central authorities in Beijing.

Even at the time of writing, giving a speech on the anniversary of the overthrowing of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Xi vowed “peaceful reunification” and made no mention of using any force, in contrast to his words in 2019.

**“Incursions” into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone**

This is where things get complicated. Internationally, Taiwan isn’t recognized as a country. It’s not a sovereign state, de-jure. Nonetheless, it has an air defense identification zone (ADIZ), which extends well beyond Taiwanese airspace. It’s objective is to act as a zone to identify any potential invasion.

Basically, any aircraft going past the median line is recorded as an “incursion”. The whole game is one of psychological warfare. By constantly make the Taiwanese scramble jets, they actually tire out the Taiwanese. It’s also super expensive to constantly scramble fighter jets. Beijing also gets to consistently apply pressure on the DPP government in Taiwan, as the relatively more pro-Beijing KMT can criticise the incumbent government for failing to maintain good relations with China and then argue that only the KMT can maintain peaceful cross-strait relations and maintain stability on the island. Think of the fighter jets as something more like Russian aircraft flying near the UK, or the US Navy exercising “freedom of navigation” in the South China Sea. It’s all meant to exert a form of geopolitical pressure. It’s not a symbol of impending invasion.

The whole narrative of Beijing consistently breaching Taiwanese airspace is a convenient narrative for the media, but obviously far from the truth. Beijing has been very careful not to go too far past the median line. It would be a very different situation if there were Chinese jets over Taipei.

The concept of a nation’s ADIZ is very different from airspace. The Convention on International Civil Aviation says that a nation’s airspace extends 12 nautical miles from the low water line along the coast of a state. There’s been a lot of argument about overlapping ADIZ's in the region. Just have a look at how they overlap here:

I hope that dispels some of the myths regarding the Taiwan ADIZ “incursions”.

**The Problems With Invading Taiwan**

**The Chinese Communist Party are much better at stirring up fervent ultra nationalism than they are at carrying out military threats**. All bark and no bite, at least on the Taiwan issue. Bold statement, you might say. Remember when a certain Senator suggested that there were US troops in Taiwan and then the Chinese state media responded in their classic aggressive style?

[it turns out there are actually US special forces on the island and they’re helping train Taiwanese forces, according to the Wall Street Journal.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211009201215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-troops-have-been-deployed-in-taiwan-for-at-least-a-year-11633614043)Where’s the promised invasion? Where is the resolute crushing of China’s largest adversary? Nothing. Xi’s recent speech actually toned the rhetoric down slightly. This revelation is hugely embarrassing for the Party, and yet, there still aren’t jets flying over Taipei. It’s actually an extremely serious matter, as US troops are technically on Chinese territory, if we are talking about internationally accepted norms. The truth is that invading Taiwan is an incredibly risky proposition, just from a purely technical perspective. China has absolutely no experience in amphibious assaults, especially a terrain like Taiwan’s. The island has also been building up on a strategy of asymmetric defence, to ensure that any PLA invasion will be met with heavy losses on both sides. Call me when troops land on the shores of Taiwan.

Now let’s say if they invaded Taiwan. Then what? They’ll have to commit lots of resources on that side of the country, leaving the Western front exposed. China cannot afford to look vulnerable on its border with India. It doesn’t make sense to do anything of the sort.

**There’s also a significant political risk in invading Taiwan:**

Over the years, Xi has built up a political monopoly on power within the Party, purging a lot of his rivals in the process of his “anti-corruption” campaigns. This leaves him particularly vulnerable should an invasion of Taiwan go wrong. It’s quite a difficult amphibious assault, and Taiwan has been preparing with an asymmetric defence strategy. Not only is it technically difficult, it’s extremely expensive. Is there going to be public appetite for spending billions of dollars on a war in the Taiwan Straits?

The reason China has long emphasised for a peaceful reunification is because the people of Taiwan and China are actually ethnic brothers and sisters. Taiwan’s Han Chinese folk account for 95% of the total population, and they also speak Mandarin as their main language.

“**Guided by the conviction we are all of the same family”, “Blood is thicker than water”.** The Chinese people actually do see the Taiwanese as part of their family. There is absolutely no political appetite to start killing their own people. When the PLA opened fire on the patriotic student protestors in Beijing, there was huge condemnation from lots of the Chinese population, including senior members of the Party. A massive purge of those who were sympathetic to the movement followed. A bloody invasion of Taiwan would be 100x worse than Tiananmen for the Party. This definitely would not be the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” that Xi has been hammering on about since he took power. No leader wants to be the one to oversee these kind of actions. Each one has passed the responsibility of figuring out what to do with Taiwan onto the next, precisely because of the fear that a wrong move could upend the entire legitimacy of the Party. Launching a war against what are essentially their own people would cause incredible instability within the CCP. The topic of “common prosperity” itself has triggered a rare spectacle of intense debate within China, with the now famed blogger Li Guangman on one side calling for a “profound revolution” sending shockwaves across the country and the establishment on the other side emphasising the fact that they’re not trying to rob Peter to pay Paul. I don’t want to imagine what launching a full-scale military invasion against Taiwan would look like in the court of public opinion in China.

The Communist Party has also gone out of its way to emphasise that it does not do things like the United States. China has never invaded countries thousands of miles away from its shores in dubious circumstances. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Mali are all examples of Western military aggression. China has always preferred trade and investment as a tool of gaining influence around the world rather than invasion. Invading Taiwan would kill the image of the Party as one which is a non-aggressor, at least on the international stage. The notion that China will not bully any other country, one backed by Xi himself, would be entirely down the drain. An invasion no doubt would whip up Japan, Australia, India and the United States. They simply can’t afford the political risk from the invasion itself, let alone a botched invasion. While no one can predict what the international reaction will be, severe action like sanctions and isolation remain a tail-risk, although one can say it does seem for Russia that their annexation of Crimea doesn’t seem to have changed a whole lot. Other tail-risks include US military intervention, but then again, there might not be any appetite for US military action after what’s happened in Afghanistan. There’s a lot of unknown variables which could come into play during this invasion, just further emphasising how much downside risks there are to Beijing in the event of a military assault on the island of Taiwan.

Invading Taiwan would also come at an enormous economic cost. As of now, China is still reliant on Taiwan being a stable island, as is the whole world. If Beijing wanted to annex the island and actually gain any benefit from it, they will need to leave it intact, something which will not be possible if a war breaks out. TSMC is the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. China hasn’t achieved independence in semiconductors just yet, but they’re trying to.

The world is pretty dependent on TSMC in the semiconductor supply chain, and so a war would be disastrous for the whole world. As a result, the only realistic option in reunifying is a peaceful one.

To finish off, the only discernible benefit of invading will be the ability to claim that the entire Chinese nation has been re-united. But the downside risks are numerous, and just like how declaring de-jure independence would have a concave payoff for Tsai Ing-wen, invading Taiwan would have a concave payoff for Xi. It doesn’t make political or economic sense to do so. Both sides benefit from an ambiguous status quo, and it’s most likely to stay that way. Beijing is more likely to continue its war in the greyzone, through incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ, launching cyberattacks, having pro-China tycoons buy up media outlets, as well as employing bots and trolls to push Chinese propaganda and misinformation. The talk of impending war is primarily being driven by the “Air incursion” narrative, which as I’ve explained earlier, is a shaky argument at best.

Note that in Hong Kong, they didn’t even bring out the PLA and PAP when rioters were throwing petrol bombs at the courts and central government buildings, as well as taking over the Legislative Council, the territory’s parliament. They could have done so by declaring a state of emergency in Hong Kong (arguably, the mass riots were an emergency), but they chose to exercise restraint, to try and maintain their image on the world stage. They didn’t want a Tiananmen 2.0 in an international city like Hong Kong.

It’s going to take something really bad for Beijing to drop its peaceful reunification policy and to go for a military solution.",geopolitics,CIA

#General Introductions

Europe has now been divided into six regions according to [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Regions_of_Europe_based_on_CIA_world_factbook.png) (thanks to /u/Zokuga for the pointer). There has been a slight reorganization of the region covered in the previous discussion: croatia has been added to southeastern Europe (last week's region), Greece has been moved to southern Europe (this week's), and Moldova will appear in eastern Europe (next week's). The region in red (Spain, Portugal, Andorra) has been combined with the region in light green (Italy, Greece, San Marino, Holy See) as well as Malta (considered part of northern Africa by the map, but not yet covered in this series) to reduce the number of weeks needed to cover Europe. 

The region under discussion is comprised of the following eight countries (sorted by population; descending):

* Italy

* Spain

* Greece

* Portugal

* Malta

* Andorra

* San Marino

* Holy See (Vatican City)

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that are not available in English.

#Observations

* The population of the region is projected to decline, with all major countries, with the exception of Spain, projected to see populations at or lower than 1960 levels. The extent of this decline is not as dramatic as that of Southeastern Europe, covered last week. 

* Major countries have been experiencing lower birthrates over the last three decades, which, when combined with their mid-bracket bulges, will lead to varying degrees of problems with population aging.

* Malta has a sharp and significant indentation in the 25-34 age brackets for females. Would anyone happen to know why?

* There is a good amount of agricultural land in the region--much of which are arable. Climate change is set to negatively affect existing crop production while enabling currently non-existent crop production. As there is a low amount of malnourishment in these developed countries, it is not likely that food security will be an issue. Agriculture makes up tiny fractions of these developed economies (median is around 2%), with the exception of Andorra, where agriculture contributes 12%.

* Aside from Malta, countries in the region have a fair amount of renewable freshwater per capita. Although water stress is an existing issue in some regions of some countries and climate change is expected to decrease water supply in almost all countries in the region, the water situation seems relatively stable going forward. This is because of declining populations should provide some relief while the wealth of these countries allow them to import water from places like central Africa.

* Greece is projected to be particularly affected by rising sea levels.

* It should be noted that all major countries in the region account for four of the five countries of PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain)--the most economically weak countries during the European debt crisis.

In order to compile my thoughts and maintain a ""big picture"" outlook on what is happening, I started to put together a series of notes that outline the situation as it unfolds. This post is one of those notes, focusing primarily on other countries and their response, interests and motivations in this crisis. 

Note, I am not advocating for either party, nor is this intended to be a fatalistic narrative. While it may seem that these thoughts are intended to paint a rather bleak picture, it is, to the best of my research ability, purely a strategic analysis of how the current crisis in Ukraine is interacting with core strategic interests of the regional powers of the world. I have taken great pains to remove any emotional, ethical or moralistic arguments because, quite frankly, I don't believe they are particularly helpful in analysing geopolitics. 

Please let me know what you think and what I have missed. I'd be happy with just thoughts and insights, but sources would be greatly appreciated. 

The United States is anxious about the threat of escalation in Europe because they have a far greater strategic interest in repivoting their military towards East Asia to check the Chinese over Taiwan, the South China Sea and reassure their allies in the region (thereby reinforcing their own security interests in the Pacific). 

This entanglement with European Affairs is complex, because the most logical focus for the United States from an economic, military and political perspective, is to reinforce their position in East Asia. Furthermore, there has been a tendency for European nations to step out of sync with Washington in recent years when it comes to foreign policy. This, coupled with the lack of the 2% GDP criteria for defence spending among NATO members, has resulted in the United States being spread thinly between its engagements in the Middle East and Afghanistan (though they have withdrawn, they will still need time to retool their army), their obligations in Asia and their maintainance of force in critical straits and trade routes around the world. Furthermore, while the US does not want a freeloading Europe, it is also not in the United States interest for Europe to federalise and develop a continental army, because this undermines the imbalance within NATO that ensures the United States a position of de-facto leadership of the alliance. As such, the United States is being forced to very carefully navigate this crisis in such a way that maintains their position in Europe without either losing influence among their allies in Europe or over committing at the expense of their allies in Asia. There is also an argument to be made that it is also in their interest to allow a non-existential (to the US) threat like Russia exist because it justifies and reinforces NATO, which affords the US enormous political leverage over the affairs of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. 

Western Europe has a long term strategic interest in maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia, not only due to a dependence on gas and oil (and not only for energy, but also for heating, on-selling and for oil based products) but also because the US intends to focus on Asia and Europe does not want to undermine decades of economic and social investment by reestablishing a continental military and introducing the uncomfortable question of greater federalisation of the European Union, which could result in a further fractioning of the currently profitable and relatively stable Eurozone. While Western Europe has been extremely willing to apply sanctions to the Russian's, many of their attempts at punitive economic measures have been relatively short lived and directed in a way that doesn't impact Europe's energy needs. This may change with the pausing of Nordstream and the renewed focus on alternative sources of energy, but that sentiment will need to stand the test of time and Europe has consistently shown that they are willing to forgive and forget where their immediate needs are concerned, if the 2008 war in Georgia or the 2014 annexation of Crimea is any indication. 

Eastern Europe has a *very* strong strategic interest in weakening the Russian State and maintaining a strong posture reinforced by a robust network of alliances. This is why you see the strongest foreign reactions to this crisis coming from Poland and the Baltics. However, they also have a historically proven imperative to refuse action unless the Western Powers are irrevocably committed. This is core to Polish Decision making and that is precisely why we see this game of hot potato being played with the Mig 29's that Poland promised to Ukraine. The West hailed the decision and promised to help in anyway they can. So the Polish refused outright to send the planes from their own territory. First it was to be sent to Germany, who declined, then to United States bases, who also declined. Therefore it appears as though the planes will remain in Poland for the time being. This is because Poland has developed a sort of national PTSD about being the first line of defense for the West, and they have integrated this trauma into their strategic foreign policy.

Southern (primarily South East Europe) Europe is desperately trying to avoid a war and maintain strict (real, not spoken) neutrality, because their economy is far more dependent on Russian Energy and Exports than that of Western Europe, and they are also very dependent on Western Economic Aid, Loans and Trade. 

The Turkish supported Ukraine immensely, right up until the beginning of this war. That is because Turkish interests aligned with Ukrainian interests during 2014-2019 (Turkey needed money to forestall an economic crisis, Ukraine needed military equipment from a non-Russia, non-US source, conveniently close to their port cities). However, the Turkish nations interest has always been vested in establishing itself as a valuable regional partner in the Black Sea, Eastern Med and Middle East. At the moment, support for Erdogan is faltering, much of its military is occupied with events in Syria and posturing against Iran, its economy is struggling and a significant portion of their gdp is dependent on Russian trade. Due to NATO and US support for the Kurds in Syria and South East Turkey, as well as 20 years of being denied candidate membership of the European Union, as well as the attempted CIA coup in 2017, the Turkish have a strong strategic interest in avoiding involvement, and this is evident by their lack of sanctions upon Russia, and their non-biased closure of the Black Sea to all non-Black Sea countries (of which Russia is the only one to maintain a fleet anyway). 

Both South America and the Middle Eastern powers have a strategic interest in maintaining their balancing act between Russia and the United States because recent history shows that both those powers proved that they are capable of intervening in local affairs, for better or for worse, and are willing to go toe to toe to compete for alliances and favourable regimes. See Syria and Venezuela for recent examples.

China has a strategic interest in maintaining the Russian State in its current form, as a cooperative and economically dependent Russia affords China a steady flow of resources, the ability to leave their northern border virtually undefended and the freedom to focus 100% of their attention on competing with the United States in the South China Sea. In so doing, they are also ensuring that the United States has to focus a great deal of resources and attention on maintaining its obligations to NATO, so that they have less ability and confidence to deal with the Chinese over the Taiwan issue. Perhaps China has a strategic interest in weakening the Russian State long term, but that is not in play at the moment because contributing to the strength of the Russian State directly impacts the far far far greater capabilities that the United States can bring to bear against China. 

East Asia is watching very intently here. For the purposes of convenience, I will lump Japan, South Korea and Taiwan together because they are all US allies who are currently uncomfortable with the notion of growing Chinese hard and soft power projection. For Taiwan, the growth of Chinese Power is rapidly approaching a point where Taiwanese Independence can be called into question. It is my analysis that East Asia is far more concerned with how the United States is reacting to this crisis, than as to what is actually happening in Russia and Ukraine. This is because the current strategic evaluation of these nations ability to resist China is underpinned by an expected level of support from the United States. A major mistep by the United States in Ukraine and in Europe, will have major ramifications on East Asia, either through over-comitting and emboldening China, or weakening their reputation and the *perception* that the US will deploy significant assets to support its allies. 

India's strategic interest lies with maintaining their balancing act between their social ties with the West, and their geopolitical ties to Russia and China. Historically, Russia has been a reliable ally to India due to both powers having very few conflicting interests and having overlapping economic needs (energy, raw materials, military equipment, in exchange for long term contracts, political support and manufacturing). Further, the Chinese and the Indians are anything but allies, with several competing interests. Without Russia, India is left in a far less negotiable position in Asian Politics as Russia is highly involved in neutralising the Sino-Indian rivalry (something the Russian's appear to have been quite desperately pursuing in the form of regional economic agreements and organizations). 

The former Soviet Union (excluding Ukraine and active members of NATO) has a strategic interest in maintaining neutrality for as long as possible and avoiding active commitment to either side because either way, their position will be strengthened by *not* getting involved. Russia under sanctions is likely to export their goods via subsidiary companies registered in their allies among the former Soviet Union, precisely what they did in Kazakhstan after the first round of sanctions in Georgia in 2008, then Ukraine in 2014. For them, waiting to see who emerges the stronger *locally* is more important than picking a side right now. Note, this is not to say that Russia will emerge stronger after this crisis, only that a Russian victory in Ukraine, closely followed by other international events that may occur, would mean that the former Soviet Republics in particular will be standing alone against Russia if they choose to support Ukraine prematurely, because if an intervention didn't happen in a definitely European country bordering NATO, it is highly unlikely to happen in Central Asia or the Caucasus. 

TLDR; Nations have interests, not feelings. Let me know if I missed any strategic interests pertaining to the crisis in Ukraine. I'd love if other regions were covered where gaps in my knowledge prevented me from including in this list! I've attempted to leave out seperate issues, except where the crisis in Ukraine is having a direct effect (such as China and the US's ongoing will they/won't they over Taiwan).

Russia has been well invested into its friendship with both China and India, online you can often see Indians chanting the friendship between Russia and India. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin [said](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/10/04/putin-says-russia-helping-china-to-build-missile-attack-warning-system-a67597) that he will be assisting the Chinese building an early warning system that would be able to spot intercontinental ballistic missile launch. I remembering reading that only Russia and the U.S possess such capability currently.  

Russia has also said, in other situations that ""Russia has gone to characterize this relationship as an alliance"" Putin had also [stated](https://vz.ru/politics/2019/10/3/1001165.html),  “***We have developed special relations over the past decade, truly  allied, strategic***.” And, or “We have an unprecedentedly high level of trust and cooperation.  This  is an allied relationship, a multifaceted strategic partnership.”

**CyberBerkut**

I have been researching the group that edited documents to try and make the popular anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, look like a Soros/CIA puppet. The name of the group is CyberBerkut and it emerged around the annexation of Crimea in March, 2014. It *purports* to be a pro-Russian Ukrainian hacking group, that supports the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 

However, it can be stated with high confidence that this group is actually a disinformation front for Russian intelligence. Basically, this isn't the first time CyberBerkut pretended to hack a video/document/audio but in reality, forged some stuff and then pretended to ""hack"" it from enemies of the Kremlin.

One of the earliest examples of disinformation by CyberBerkut was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsehPE5cEFs) which it claimed it ""hacked"" from the laptop of one of John McCain's aides when he visited Ukraine as a show of U.S. support (McCain is demonized in Russian media for being a hardliner towards Russia). They claimed the video shows some actors pretending to be Jihadi John and James Foley, his execution being filmed in front of a green screen! But the good folks over at MetaBunk did a frame-by-frame comparison of the real execution video and the so-called ""leaked"" filming of the set. They found that the actor had different movements compared to the real JJ, along with several other visual mismatches. Here's the full debunking:

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-cyberberkut-video-supposedly-showing-staged-isis-beheading-of-foley.t6520/

This ""secret"" video was prominently featured on sites like InfoWars and Global Research.

Now, who would have the time, money, resources, and will power (complete with actors, clothing, cameras, props, etc.,) to put so much effort into creating a fake video to spread the conspiracy theory that America is staging ISIS' videos and is controlling it? Only a state like Russia, of course.

The second example of disinformation by CyberBerkut is a video showing neo-Nazi pro-Ukrainian fighters burning the Dutch flag. Russian propaganda likes to portray Ukraine as a failed state with Nazi/fascist hordes ""genociding"" ethnic Russian and that the U.S. supports this, much in the way it claims the U.S. supports ISIS in Syria. Anyway, the significance of this video, in which the fighters burned a Dutch flag, is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the Netherlands, regarding Ukraine being allowed to sign the EU Association Agreement. This video [was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at Bellingcat.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/comment-page-4/#comments) It proved the video itself was fake and that Russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web. Interestingly, Bellingcat's website was hacked and defaced by CyberBerkut. I wonder why? They've also been implicated in DDoS attacks on NATO, Ukrainian, and German government websites.

Another example is when CyberBerkut pretended to hack documents from Ukraine's SBU. One document was a confidential letter from Vasili Gritsak (SBU's First Deputy Chairman and the head of its Anti-Terrorism Center) to Hennadiy Kuznetsov (SBU Colonel, then head of Special Operations Center A, a unit responsible for special anti-terrorist operations), appearing to show Gritsak directing Kuznetsov to carry out ""false flag"" attacks in Eastern Ukraine to blame on pro-Russian separatists. The objective of forging these documents and then pretending to hack them from Ukraine's SBU was to make it look like pro-Russian separatists were being unfairly blamed for civilian deaths.

Interestingly, Russia disinformation is obsessed with making anything that puts Russia in a bad light a ""false flag."" Russian trolls have been caught posting conspiracy theories of MH17 being a CIA/NATO/Ukrainian false flag or that they were aiming for Putin's plane but accidentally hit MH17. A laughable theory, but one that many in Russia accept.

Here are some more examples of blatantly clear Russian disinformation:

Russian troll factory spreading disinformation about murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov's death being a CIA false flag to destabilize Russia:

>When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.

>""They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that',"" she said.

>[""On that day they were writing that **it was a provocation against the authorities, that he was killed by 'his own people'.""**](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-12/inside-russia's-troll-factory-internet-forums-social-media/6692318)

The above tactic of calling everything a ""false flag, such as MH17, is a good example of what Russia is trying to achieve: confusion and paralysis in the minds of Westerners so they question anything critical of Russia. Critics of Russia are smeared as being ""anti-Russia"", ""Russophobic"", ""neocons"", ""warmongers"", etc. Elliot Higgins and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, have been demonized in the Russian media and Russian trolls online.

The unofficial Russian branch of Anonymous (Shaltai Boltai) hacked the ""Internet Research Agency"" - a well known Russian troll farm - and leaked *everything* - emails, names, contact information, salaries, lists of troll accounts, assignments, you name it.

**Cyberattacks and Leaks Though Front Groups**

Snowden also blamed the recent NSA cyberweapons leaks on Russia. Snowden's tweets in full (bolded for emphasis by me):
  
---

The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)

1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.

2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.

3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create ""fingerprints"" to help us detect them in the future.

4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.

5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools (""binaries"") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.

6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.

7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but **I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.**

8) **Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility.** Here's why that is significant:

9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.

10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.

11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.

12) **Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.**

13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.

**Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...**

**The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.**

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Only a state has the power to leak NSA's weapons left on a server. I agree with Snowden's assessment that it was Russia. His reasoning is that this is a warning to America. Before the FBI publicly announces those behind the DNC leak, Russia is warning the U.S. that they can prove the U.S. hacking into computers too.

What surprises me most is how naive the West has become. We're being bombarded with leaks on an almost weekly basis now. Most people have probably focused on the DNC leaks, but did you know that a group calling itself ""DCLeaks"" leaked the internal documents of liberal George Soros' Open Society Foundation AND the private emails of the NATO general? Here's a look at their [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dcleaks_) (tell me if you notice their emphasis on a certain country):

>Hacked NATO general defends plotting to push Obama to escalate tensions with Russia 

>Breedlove’s war: Emails show ex-NATO general plotting US conflict with Russia

>Dangerous Propaganda: Network Close To NATO Military Leader Fueled Ukraine Conflict

>Emails show Obama saw US involvement in Russia talks as a 'threat' 

>'Gen. plotted against Obama on Russia'  

>Check George Soros's OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values

All they post are tweets relevant to Russia.

[ThreatConnect Identifies DCLeaks As Another Russian-backed Influence Outlet](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)

Also, Russia hates NATO and Soros, which are the only topics the leaks from DCLeaks talk about.

What's most interesting is that the Russians lost access to their hacked NSA computer June 2013 directly because of the actions of Snowden. Snowden claims that after he outed the secrets of the NSA, the NSA was forced to change the computers it uses for offensive operations, thus booting out the Russians too.

**We now have proof of four leaks in mere weeks, all done by Russia, to influence Americans' opinions on the 2016 election (pro-Trump), to hate NATO, to publicly embarrass the NSA and warn the FBI of the consequences of announcing Russia was behind the DNC leaks, and disinformation about Soros to lure Trump supporters. This is unprecedented in Western history - Cold War active measures are back. They are using fake personas - ""Guccifer2.0"", ""DCLeaks"", and now ""The Shadow Brokers"" - the NSA weapons leakers - to destabilize the U.S.**

Assange doesn't care about the truth. He only cares at getting back at Clinton. He's been handed no less than 4 separate leaks in the past few weeks (DNC emails, Soros foundation's intranet documents, NATO general's emails, and NSA cyber weapons). He's a whistleblower with a talented background in programming/hacking just like Snowden. He should be feeling suspicious about the large number of leaks regarding the U.S. But he hasn't publicly mentioned it - he knows it's Russia, but won't admit it. As an interesting aside, Guccifer2.0 claimed on Twitter [that he gave Assange the DNC emails](https://twitter.com/GUCCIFER_2/status/756530278982684672). If so, why is Assange spreading conspiracy theories about the dead DNC staffer, Seth Rich? Strange indeed.

**Russian Propaganda in the West: Websites and Astroturfers**

Russia is relying on naive Westerners to hate NATO and Soros. In other words, useful idiots. These people tend to be Conservative, Christian,, and conspiracy theorists to boot. They tend to be anti-establishment. Basically, much of the Republican base. Putin is popular among Republicans since he is viewed as a strongman and Conservative types are attracted to that. Furthermore, the Conservative media has portrayed Putin as a saviour of Christianity and in comparison to Obama, who they view as a secret Muslim Socialist/Communist from Kenya, he is respected much more by those on the Right. Russian Active Measure takes this into account. As an example, a well known anonymous hoaxer named ""Sorcha Faal"" - who claims to have access to the GRU/SVR/FSB - has since 2005 posted various hoax articles all favourable to Russia and pandering to the Right. Such examples  include his/her article on ""Putin declaring Black Lives Matter (BLM) a terrorist organization,"" something obviously false and never even confirmed. And yet, those who planted this story *knew* Republicans hate BLM since they are anti-cop and by extension, anti-authority, anathema to patriotic Rightists. Other examples include frequent commentary on Soros trying to reduce the birth rate and promote inter-ethnic marriage, and of course, the refugee crisis in Europe. The latter crisis is more applicable to Europe and Russian Active Measures has taken that into account. Countless viral news sites have popped up since 2014, all focused on the refugee crisis with anti-migrant commentary written by anonymous authors. These websites are extremely pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and frequently post anti-EU articles, along with conspiracy theories. These websites have popped up all over Europe in various languages.  Here is a partial list of them, with analysis by a keen Russian disinformation-watcher, who analyzed the funding, founders, WHOIS, and social media links of these websites:

Here's a good article to read: [The pro-Russian Disinformation Campaign

I see from reddit.com/r/The_Donald that you people already hate Soros (links often lead to Russian disinformation websites) and think NATO should turn into a protection racket, ignoring basic hegemonic theory and forward deployment strategy of the U.S. near Russia and China. 

As an example, take a look at this conspiracy theory (and irrational) self post from /r/The_Donald:

**Political Control**

One extremely far-right party in Hungary, called *Jobbik*, that is vehemently pro-Russian, was investigated by an independent Hungarian journalist, who wrote an article detailing the long-running recruitment of a Hungarian man, Béla Kovács, by Russia, after he married another KGB agent from Russia whom he met in Japan, when his father worked at the Hungarian embassy there. His new wife exposed him to the fact that he himself had been adopted and his real father was a KGB agent. Kovács then went to Russia and upon returning, had become pro-Russian and wealthy enough to fund a new Hungarian political party, called Jobbik, who he would later represent in the European Parliament. His father, who worked at the Hungarian embassy in Japan (a country thoroughly infiltrated by the Soviets due to its weak intelligence system) during the Cold War, was told by a stationed Hungarian intelligence officer that this woman his son had met was a long-running KGB agent that had previously married not only a Japanese nuclear scientist (presumably for access to nuclear technology) but also an Austrian underworld criminal (presumably for an Austrian passport to enable free travel through the EU's Schengen Zone). Most likely, she recruited Kovács to the KGB by telling him his father was a KGB agent and that he was adopted. The Jobbik party is extremely pro-Russian and borderline neo-Nazi. Russia has been accused of funding and developing it through Kovács. Both Kovács and his wife are under investigation.

Just goes to show how far back Russia has infiltrated European parties.

**Response by the West**

This may sound cheesy, but the West doesn't do disinformation. Even during the Cold War, the side known for disinformation (Active Measures) was the Soviet block, not the West. Russia is an authoritarian country. It has no qualms paying thousands of people to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda online. 

Europe has set up some sort of media monitoring centre, called [""East StratCom Task Force""](http://disinfo.com/2016/01/disinformation-review-week-ten/), to counter Russian propaganda, that they created in March of 2015. It's one of the most pathetic and useless things I've even seen. All they do is make a weekly .pdf file of Russia's lies and conspiracy theories Russian trolls try to spread online. They then [upload said pdf file](http://eeas.europa.eu/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_12-01-2016.pdf) to some random corner of the web and call that their ""response"". Passive but not active.

The U.S. isn't doing anything to debunk the disinformation the Russian trolls are spreading. We need to create a counter-narrative to Russia's claims. Part of this means we have to be on the right side of the truth. Whether you agree or not, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia and earlier polls going back to the 90s indicate they've always supported this. Whenever Obama says ""Crimea was annexed"", his statements are translated/subtitled to Russian and put on YouTube for the Russians to be outraged at, because in their view, they're being punished for democracy. This benefits Putin and demonizes the West's arguments, so whenever we try and prove Putin is corrupt, the Russian populace assumes we're lying and smearing him. They've been mentally conditioned to ignore criticism of Putin. Putin's approval ratings are the highest in the world. Before the Crimea issue, they were hovering in the 60s, not much higher than where Obama is now. Afterwards, in February 2014, they skyrocketed to the 90s range. We in the West must accept that our rhetoric and message are too harsh for Russians. We should tone down the Crimea rhetoric and instead, focus on other things that irk Russia, like corruption in Putin's party, or pro-Russian rebels in E. Ukraine committing heinous crimes/torture.

For now, read some of this history regarding Soviet Active Measures (relevant to our current situation):

19,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,94.0,5bgwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/,15.0,1478453724.0,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>---

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>---

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

He frequently re-tweets WikiLeaks, just like DCLeaks. He re-tweets and follows conspiracy theory outlets like Alex Jones and Roger Stone, just like DCLeaks followed RT and PressTV. Of course, he sprang back to life two days ago, right before Election Day, to complain about ""Democrats rigging the election."" I thought he didn't favour any political party?

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? “Do you feel in charge?” Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?

>TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight. But first questions.

>Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing “Free Press” is not being “Free as in free beer” or “Free as in free of government influence?

>Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

But considering this, it seems that it isn't quite true. Some systems are more resilient and either have more redundant, swap-able inputs, or rely on more robust inputs. And some things are more delicate and require greater webs of systems to function. 

I'm imagining a chart, or a map, or some kind of representation of the interdependencies where you can visualize the degree of dependency of one system on another.

For example you could select semiconductors, and it would highlight the industries that rely on them and the relative degree to which they rely on them. Or you could toggle a switch and see the things that the semiconductor industry relies on and so forth. 

Or take a car. The metal can be sourced from mines all over the world. The transmissions can be made in a handful of factories. The semiconductors all come from TSMC. So you could give this car a resiliency rating, based on the resilience of its dependencies. 


Of course this quickly gets extremely complicated due to the recursive dependencies. But I wonder if there isn't some limit that you can approach where modeling this gives you a basic rough idea of the general anatomy of the global supply chain and its main limbs and interconnections. This is the sort of thing I would picture some CIA analyst manipulating on a clear glass screen deep in some fusion hub in a Tom Cruise movie. I would think there has to be some version of this somewhere..

Or maybe the software is just the minds of those capable of imagining and comprehending all of these relationships?",geopolitics,CIA

The people of Southern Cameroons, a region denied its own autonomy and forced pick between choosing Cameroon or Nigeria in 1961, have been marginalized and denied educational and job opportunities. The resources in their region has been used by the oppressive french Cameroon regime and their French neocolonizers. An attempt to protest for independence has been met with swift military reaction. The French military has been sent to Anglophone regions (English speaking region and former British colony) and have been killing people. They rape women and girls while shoot dead young men and teenage boys to prevent them from joining the secessionists that want independence and are trying to protect the Anglophone. The boiling point was when the Cameroonian government started to replace English speaking teachers with french speaking teachers to anglophone region as well as remove English speaking courts. It was meant to completely turn all regions of Cameroon into a francophone region and further marginalize its anglophone region.

Anglophone region infrastructure has been neglected and any criticisms of the regime has resulted in execution and imprisonment for decades since Paul Biya's regime in 1982. It's baffling this isn't getting attention. Hospitals are burned down, people are tortured in prisons, people are running to bushes and starving. Many are refugees. Only BBC News has been covering this. Other mainstream news outlets haven't said a word. NPR has even said anything. Other events in African and Middle East get airtime such as a small headliner reporting South Sudan's civil war ending. How is this not getting enough attention. Many Anglophone diaspora are concern with speaking out too much since Cameroon officials have been arresting relatives for associating with secessionists. 

This recent article deals with some death toll number well over the 1000s.

The Anglophone and Francophone regions have tried being together but it has resulted in English speaking marginalization. They want their independence. Some better off Anglophone side with the current Cameroon regime out of cowardice and protection compared to the poorer ones that want better opportunity. They and the regime have lied to U.N. officials and U.S. Ambassadors. The U.S. CIA has intelligence to know whats truly on so what's going on? The U.N. lacks credibility and they don't do anything. These other global powers are not openly supporting but keep asking Biya to solve the issue. I don;t know what they mean by that. The only way he can solve it is by giving them independence or by killing them all. Right now, he's been doing the later and he might win if pressure isn't put on him to stop. I keep seeing articles saying the U.K. and Switzerland hope to help Biya's regime. I don't trust it and I'm concern they along with other countries benefit from Biya's regime.

He gives them access to resources belonging to the English speaking side. I don't see why these countries wouldn't just support Anglophone independence and just trade with them. The lack of attention this is getting allows for these global powers to continue to partner with a totalitarian murderous dictator. If this got major social media attention or if a popular celebrity or athlete spoke up about this, the attention would put pressure. The Nigerian girls kidnapped by Boko Haram years ago got major attention and led to action. This whole thing is very suspicious. Outlets like Vice News that usually covers a lot of geopoltical events throughout South/Central America, Africa, Europe, Middle East, East/South Asia, and more aren't covering this. There's no way they wouldn't know. BBC News does. Are they intentionally not reporting? 

Ambazonia has enough diaspora and access to setting up a government to have independence. They had faculties and intuitions dating back to the 60's as its own state until it was destroyed as Cameroon became a centralized regime that further minimize Anglophone English Speaking Cameroon of its autonomy.

Iran: The Next War

Even before the bombs fell on Baghdad, a group of senior
Pentagon officials were plotting to invade another
country. Their covert campaign once again relied on false
intelligence and shady allies. But this time, the target
was Iran. BY JAMES BAMFORD

I. The Israeli Connection

A few blocks off Pennsylvania Avenue, the FBI’s eight-
story Washington field office exudes all the charm of a
maximum-security prison. Its curved roof is made of thick
stainless steel, the bottom three floors are wrapped in
granite and limestone, hydraulic bollards protect the ramp
to the four-floor garage, and bulletproof security booths
guard the entrance to the narrow lobby. On the fourth
floor, like a tomb within a tomb, lies the most secret
room in the $100 million concrete fortress—out-of-bounds
even for special agents without an escort. Here, in the
Language Services Section, hundreds of linguists in padded
earphones sit elbow-to-elbow in long rows, tapping
computer keyboards as they eavesdrop on the phone lines of
foreign embassies and other high-priority targets in the
nation’s capital.

At the far end of that room, on the morning of February
12th, 2003, a small group of eavesdroppers were listening
intently for evidence of a treacherous crime. At the very
moment that American forces were massing for an invasion
of Iraq, there were indications that a rogue group of
senior Pentagon officials were already conspiring to push
the United States into another war—this time with Iran.

A few miles away, FBI agents watched as Larry Franklin, an
Iran expert and career employee of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, drove up to the Ritz-Carlton hotel
across the Potomac from Washington. A trim man of fifty-
six, with a tangle of blond hair speckled gray, Franklin
had left his modest home in Kearneysville, West Virginia,
shortly before dawn that morning to make the eighty-mile
commute to his job at the Pentagon. Since 2002, he had
been working in the Office of Special Plans, a crowded
warren of blue cubicles on the building’s fifth floor. A
secretive unit responsible for long-term planning and
propaganda for the invasion of Iraq, the office’s staffers
referred to themselves as ""the cabal."" They reported to
Douglas Feith, the third-most-powerful official in the
Defense Department, helping to concoct the fraudulent
intelligence reports that were driving America to war in
Iraq.

Just two weeks before, in his State of the Union address,
President Bush had begun laying the groundwork for the
invasion, falsely claiming that Saddam Hussein had the
means to produce tens of thousands of biological and
chemical weapons, including anthrax, botulinum toxin,
sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. But an attack on Iraq
would require something that alarmed Franklin and other
neoconservatives almost as much as weapons of mass
destruction: detente with Iran. As political columnist
David Broder reported in The Washington Post, moderates in
the Bush administration were ""covertly negotiating for
Iran to stay quiet and offer help to refugees when we go
into Iraq.""

Franklin—a devout neoconservative who had been brought
into Feith’s office because of his political beliefs—was
hoping to undermine those talks. As FBI agents looked on,
Franklin entered the restaurant at the Ritz and joined two
other Americans who were also looking for ways to push the
U.S. into a war with Iran. One was Steven Rosen, one of
the most influential lobbyists in Washington. Sixty years
old and nearly bald, with dark eyebrows and a seemingly
permanent frown, Rosen was director of foreign-policy
issues at Israel’s powerful lobby, the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee. Seated next to Rosen was AIPAC’s
Iran expert, Keith Weissman. He and Rosen had been working
together closely for a decade to pressure U.S. officials
and members of Congress to turn up the heat on Tehran.

Over breakfast at the Ritz-Carlton, Franklin told the two
lobbyists about a draft of a top-secret National Security
Presidential Directive that dealt with U.S. policy on
Iran. Crafted by Michael Rubin, the desk officer for Iraq
and Iran in Feith’s office, the document called, in
essence, for regime change in Iran. In the Pentagon’s
view, according to one senior official there at the time,
Iran was nothing but ""a house of cards ready to be pushed
over the precipice."" So far, though, the White House had
rejected the Pentagon’s plan, favoring the State
Department’s more moderate position of diplomacy. Now,
unwilling to play by the rules any longer, Franklin was
taking the extraordinary—and illegal—step of passing on
highly classified information to lobbyists for a foreign
state. Unable to win the internal battle over Iran being
waged within the administration, a member of Feith’s
secret unit in the Pentagon was effectively resorting to
treason, recruiting AIPAC to use its enormous influence to
pressure the president into adopting the draft directive
and wage war against Iran.

It was a role that AIPAC was eager to play. Rosen,
recognizing that Franklin could serve as a useful spy,
immediately began plotting ways to plant him in the White
House—specifically in the National Security Council, the
epicenter of intelligence and national-security policy. By
working there, Rosen told Franklin a few days later, he
would be ""by the elbow of the president.""

Knowing that such a maneuver was well within AIPAC’s
capabilities, Franklin asked Rosen to ""put in a good word""
for him. Rosen agreed. ""I’ll do what I can,"" he said,
adding that the breakfast meeting had been a real ""eye-
opener.""

Working together, the two men hoped to sell the United
States on yet another bloody war. A few miles away,
digital recorders at the FBI’s Language Services Section
captured every word.

II. The Guru and the Exile

In recent weeks, the attacks by Hezbollah on Israel have
given neoconservatives in the Bush administration the
pretext they were seeking to launch what former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich calls ""World War III."" Denouncing
the bombings as ""Iran’s proxy war,"" William Kristol of The
Weekly Standard is urging the Pentagon to counter ""this
act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against
Iranian nuclear facilities."" According to Joseph
Cirincione, an arms expert and the author of Deadly
Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats, ""The
neoconservatives are now hoping to use the Israeli-Lebanon
conflict as the trigger to launch a U.S. war against
Syria, Iran or both.""

The White House accuses Iran and its president, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, of developing WMDs and posing ""a grave
threat"" — the exact same pretexts it used to invade Iraq.

But the Bush administration’s hostility toward Iran is not
simply an outgrowth of the current crisis. War with Iran
has been in the works for the past five years, shaped in
almost complete secrecy by a small group of senior
Pentagon officials attached to the Office of Special
Plans. The man who created the OSP was Douglas Feith, the
undersecretary of defense for policy. A former Middle East
specialist on the National Security Council in the Reagan
administration, Feith had long urged Israel to secure its
borders in the Middle East by attacking Iraq and Iran.
After Bush’s election, Feith went to work to make that
vision a reality, putting together a team of
neoconservative hawks determined to drive the U.S. to
attack Tehran. Before Bush had been in office a year,
Feith’s team had arranged a covert meeting in Rome with a
group of Iranians to discuss their clandestine help.

The meeting was arranged by Michael Ledeen, a member of
the cabal brought aboard by Feith because of his
connections in Iran. Described by The Jerusalem Post
as ""Washington’s neoconservative guru,"" Ledeen grew up in
California during the 1940s. His father designed the air-
conditioning system for Walt Disney Studios, and Ledeen
spent much of his early life surrounded by a world of
fantasy. ""All through my childhood we were an adjunct of
the Disney universe,"" he once recalled. ""According to
family legend, my mother was the model for Snow White, and
we have a picture of her that does indeed look just like
the movie character.""

In 1977, after earning a Ph.D. in history and philosophy
and teaching in Rome for two years, Ledeen became the
first executive director of the Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs, a pro-Israel pressure group
that served as a flagship of the neoconservative movement.
A few years later, after Reagan was elected, Ledeen had
become prominent enough to earn a spot as a consultant to
the National Security Council alongside Feith. There he
played a central role in the worst scandal of Reagan’s
presidency: the covert deal to provide arms to Iran in
exchange for American hostages being held in Lebanon.
Ledeen served as the administration’s intermediary with
Israel in the illegal-arms deal. In 1985, he met with
Manucher Ghorbanifar, a one-time Iranian carpet salesman
who was widely believed to be an Israeli agent. The CIA
considered Ghorbanifar a dangerous con man and had issued
a ""burn notice"" recommending that no U.S. agency have any
dealings with him. Unfazed, Ledeen called Ghorbanifar ""one
of the most honest, educated, honorable men I have ever
known."" The two men brokered the arms exchange—a
transaction that would result in the indictment of
fourteen senior officials in the Reagan administration.

""It was awful—you know, bad things happened,"" Ledeen says
now. ""When Iran-Contra was over, I said, ?Boy, I’m never
going to touch Iran again.’ ""

But in 2001, soon after he arrived at the Pentagon, Ledeen
once again met with Ghorbanifar. This time, instead of
selling missiles to the Iranian regime, the two men were
exploring how best to topple it.

""The meeting in Rome came about because my friend Manucher
Ghorbanifar called me up,"" Ledeen says. Stout and balding,
with a scruffy white beard, Ledeen is sitting in the
living room of his white-brick home in Chevy Chase,
Maryland, smoking a Dominican cigar. His Airedale terrier,
Thurber, roams the room protectively. In his first
extensive interview about the covert Pentagon operation,
Ledeen makes no secret of his desire to topple the
government in Tehran. ""I want to bring down the regime,""
he says. ""I want the regime gone. It’s a country that is
fanatically devoted to our destruction.""

When Ghorbanifar called Ledeen in the fall of 2001, he
claimed, as he often does, to have explosive intelligence
that was vital to U.S. interests. ""There are Iranians who
have firsthand information about Iranian plans to kill
Americans in Afghanistan,"" he told Ledeen. ""Does anyone
want to hear about it?""

Ledeen took the information to Stephen Hadley, the deputy
national security adviser at the White House. ""I know
you’re going to throw me out of the office,"" Ledeen told
him, ""and if I were you I would throw me out of the office
too. But I promised that I would give you this option.
Ghorbanifar has called me. He said these people are
willing to come. Do you want anybody to go and talk to
them?""

Hadley was interested. So was Zalmay Khalilzad, then the
point man on Near East issues for the National Security
Council and now the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad. ""I think
we have to do this, we have to hear this,"" Hadley said.
Ledeen had the green light: As he puts it, ""Every element
of the American government knew this was going to happen
in advance.""

III. The Meeting in Rome

Weeks later, in December, a plane carrying Ledeen traveled
to Rome with two other members of Feith’s secret Pentagon
unit: Larry Franklin and Harold Rhode, a protégé of Ledeen
who has been called the ""theoretician of the neocon
movement."" A specialist on Islam who speaks Hebrew,
Arabic, Turkish and Farsi, Rhode had experience with shady
exiles like Ghorbanifar: He was close to Ahmed Chalabi,
the Iraqi dissident whose discredited intelligence helped
drive the Bush administration to invade Baghdad. According
to UPI, Rhode himself was later observed by CIA operatives
passing ""mind-boggling"" intelligence to Israel, including
sensitive information about U.S. military deployments in
Iraq.

attended the meeting in Rome, has pleaded guilty to
passing classified information about Iran to a pro-Israel
lobbying group. (photo: AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)

Completing the rogues’ gallery that assembled in Rome that
day was the man who helped Ledeen arrange the meeting:
Nicolò Pollari, the director of Italy’s military
intelligence. Only two months earlier, Pollari had
informed the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had
obtained uranium from West Africa—a key piece of false
intelligence that Bush used to justify the invasion of
Iraq.

To hide the shadowy rendezvous in Rome, Pollari provided a
well-protected safe house near the noisy espresso bars and
busy trattorias that surround the Piazza di Spagna in
central Rome. ""It was in a private apartment,"" Ledeen
recalls. ""It was fucking freezing—it was unheated."" The
Pentagon operatives and the men from Iran sat at a dining-
room table strewn with demitasse cups of blackish coffee,
ashtrays littered with crushed cigarette butts and
detailed maps of Iran, Iraq and Syria. ""They gave us
information about the location and plans of Iranian
terrorists who were going to kill Americans,"" Ledeen says.

Ledeen insists the intelligence was on the mark. ""It was
true,"" he says. ""The information was accurate."" Not
according to his boss. ""There wasn’t anything there that
was of substance or of value that needed to be pursued
further,"" Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later
conceded. ""It went nowhere.""

The men then turned their attention to their larger goal:
regime change in Iran. Ghorbanifar suggested funding the
overthrow of the Iranian government using hundreds of
millions of dollars in cash supposedly hidden by Saddam
Hussein. He even hinted that Saddam was hiding in Iran.

Ledeen, Franklin and Rhode were taking a page from Feith’s
playbook on Iraq: They needed a front group of exiles and
dissidents to call for the overthrow of Iran. According to
sources familiar with the meeting, the Americans discussed
joining forces with the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an anti-Iranian
guerrilla army operating out of Iraq.

There was only one small problem: The MEK had been
certified by the State Department as a terrorist
organization. In fact, the White House was in the midst of
negotiations with Tehran, which was offering to extradite
five members of Al Qaeda thought to be of high
intelligence value in return for Washington’s promise to
drop all support for the MEK.

Ledeen denies any dealings with the group. ""I wouldn’t get
within a hundred miles of the MEK,"" he says. ""They have no
following, no legitimacy."" But neoconservatives were eager
to undermine any deal that involved cooperating with Iran.
To the neocons, the value of the MEK as a weapon against
Tehran greatly outweighed any benefit that might be
derived from interrogating the Al Qaeda operatives—even
though they might provide intelligence on future terrorist
attacks, as well as clues to the whereabouts of Osama bin
Laden.

Ledeen and his Pentagon cabal were not the only American
officials to whom Ghorbanifar tried to funnel false
intelligence on Iran. Last year, Rep. Curt Weldon, a
Republican from Pennsylvania, claimed he had intelligence—
from an ""impeccable clandestine source"" he code-
named ""Ali""—that the Iranian government was plotting to
launch attacks against the United States. But when the CIA
investigated the allegations, it turned out that Ali was
Fereidoun Mahdavi, an Iranian exile who was serving as a
frontman for Ghorbanifar and trying to shake down the CIA
for $150,000. ""He is a fabricator,"" said Bill Murray, the
former CIA station chief in Paris. Weldon was furious: The
agency had dismissed Ali, he insisted, ""because they want
to avoid, at all costs, drawing the United States into a
war with Iran.""

After the Rome rendezvous, Ledeen and Ghorbanifar
continued to meet several times a year, often for a day or
two at a time. Rhode also met with Ghorbanifar in Paris,
and the Iranian phoned or faxed his Pentagon contacts
almost every day. At one point Ledeen notified the
Pentagon that Ghorbanifar knew of highly enriched uranium
being moved from Iraq to Iran. At another point, in 2003,
he claimed that Tehran was only a few months away from
exploding a nuclear bomb—even though international experts
estimate that Iran is years away from developing nuclear
weapons. But the accuracy of the reports wasn’t important—
what mattered was their value in drumming up support for
war. It was Iraq all over again.

IV. On the Trail of Mr. X

Such covert efforts by Feith’s team in the Pentagon
started to have the desired effect. In November 2003,
Rumsfeld approved a plan known as CONPLAN 8022-02, which
for the first time established a pre-emptive-strike
capability against Iran. That was followed in 2004 by a
top-secret ""Interim Global Strike Alert Order"" that put
the military on a state of readiness to launch an airborne
and missile attack against Iran, should Bush issue the
command. ""We’re now at the point where we are essentially
on alert,"" said Lt. Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of the
8th Air Force. ""We have the capacity to plan and execute
global strikes in half a day or less.""

But as the Pentagon moved the country closer to war with
Iran, the FBI was expanding its investigation of AIPAC and
its role in the plot. David Szady, then the bureau’s top
spy-catcher, had become convinced that at least one
American citizen working inside the U.S. government was
spying for Israel. ""It’s no longer just our traditional
adversaries who want to steal our secrets, but sometimes
even our allies,"" Szady declared. ""The threat is
incredibly serious."" To locate the spy sometimes referred
to as Mr. X, agents working for Szady began focusing on a
small group of neoconservatives in the Pentagon—including
Feith, Ledeen and Rhode.

The FBI also had its sights on Larry Franklin, who
continued to hold clandestine meetings with Rosen at
AIPAC. Apparently nervous that the FBI might be on to
them, the two men started taking precautions. On March
10th, 2003, barely a week before the invasion of Iraq,
Rosen met Franklin in Washington’s cavernous Union
Station. The pair met at one restaurant, then they hustled
to another, and finally they ended up in a third—this one
totally empty. As an added precaution, Franklin also began
sending faxes to Rosen’s home instead of to his AIPAC
offices.

A few days later, Rosen and Weissman passed on to Israeli-
embassy officials details about the draft of the top-
secret presidential directive on Iran, saying they had
received the document from a ""friend of ours in the
Pentagon."" They also relayed to the Israelis details about
internal Bush-administration discussions on Iran. Then,
two days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rosen leaked
the information to the press with the comment ""I’m not
supposed to know this."" The Washington Post eventually
published the story under the headline ""Pressure Builds
for President to Declare Strategy on Iran,"" crediting the
classified information to ""well-placed sources."" The story
mentioned Ledeen, who helped found the Coalition for
Democracy in Iran, a pressure group dedicated to the
overthrow of the Iranian government, but gave no
indication that the leak had come from someone with a
definite agenda for planting the information.

That June, Weissman called Franklin and left a message
that he and Rosen wanted to meet with him again and talk
about ""our favorite country."" The meeting took place in
the Tivoli Restaurant, a dimly lit establishment two
floors above the metro station in Arlington that was
frequently used by intelligence types for quiet
rendezvous. Over lunch in the mirrored dining room, the
three men discussed the Post article, and Rosen
acknowledged ""the constraints"" Franklin was under to meet
with them. But the Pentagon official placed himself fully
at AIPAC’s disposal. ""You set the agenda,"" Franklin told
Rosen.

In addition to meeting Rosen and Weissman, Franklin was
also getting together regularly with Naor Gilon, an
Israeli embassy official who, according to a senior U.S.
counterintelligence official, ""showed every sign of being
an intelligence agent."" Franklin and Gilon would normally
meet amid the weight machines and punching bags at the
Pentagon Officers Athletic Club, where Franklin passed
along secret information regarding Iran’s activities in
Iraq, its missile-testing program and even, apparently,
New York Times reporter Judith Miller. At one point, Gilon
suggested that Franklin meet with Uzi Arad, Mossad’s
former director of intelligence and former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign-policy adviser. A week later,
Franklin had lunch in the Pentagon cafeteria with the
former top Israeli spy.

V. Iran’s Double Agent

Larry Franklin, it turns out, wasn’t the only person
involved in the Pentagon’s covert operation who was
exchanging state secrets with other governments. As the
FBI monitored Franklin and his clandestine dealings with
AIPAC, it was also investigating another explosive case of
espionage linked to Feith’s office and Iran. This one
focused on Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National
Congress, the militant anti-Saddam opposition group that
had worked for more than a decade to pressure the U.S.
into invading Iraq.

For years, the National Security Agency had possessed the
codes used by Iran to encrypt its diplomatic messages,
enabling the U.S. government to eavesdrop on virtually
every communication between Tehran and its embassies.
After the U.S. invaded Baghdad, the NSA used the codes to
listen in on details of Iran’s covert operations inside
Iraq. But in 2004, the agency intercepted a series of
urgent messages from the Iranian embassy in Baghdad.
Intelligence officials at the embassy had discovered the
massive security breach—tipped off by someone familiar
with the U.S. code-breaking operation.

The blow to intelligence-gathering could not have come at
a worse time. The Bush administration suspected that the
Shiite government in Iran was aiding Shiite insurgents in
Iraq, who were killing U.S. soldiers. The administration
was also worried that Tehran was secretly developing
nuclear weapons. Now, crucial intelligence that might have
shed light on those operations had been cut off,
potentially endangering American lives.

On May 20th, shortly after the discovery of the leak,
Iraqi police backed by American soldiers raided Chalabi’s
home and offices in Baghdad. The FBI suspected that
Chalabi, a Shiite who had a luxurious villa in Tehran and
was close to senior Iranian officials, was actually
working as a spy for the Shiite government of Iran.
Getting the U.S. to invade Iraq was apparently part of a
plan to install a pro-Iranian Shiite government in
Baghdad, with Chalabi in charge. The bureau also suspected
that Chalabi’s intelligence chief had furnished Iran with
highly classified information on U.S. troop movements, top-
secret communications, plans of the provisional government
and other closely guarded material on U.S. operations in
Iraq. On the night of the raid, The CBS Evening News
carried an exclusive report by correspondent Lesley Stahl
that the U.S. government had ""rock-solid"" evidence that
Chalabi had been passing extremely sensitive intelligence
to Iran—evidence so sensitive that it could ""get Americans
killed.""

The revelation shocked Franklin and other members of
Feith’s office. If true, the allegations meant that they
had just launched a war to put into power an agent of
their mortal enemy, Iran. Their man—the dissident leader
who sat behind the first lady in the president’s box
during the State of the Union address in which Bush
prepared the country for war—appeared to have been working
for Iran all along.

Franklin needed to control the damage, and fast. He was
one of the very few in the government who knew that it was
the NSA code-breaking information that Chalabi was
suspected of passing to Iran, and that there was absolute
proof that Chalabi had met with a covert Iranian agent
involved in operations against the U.S. To protect those
in the Pentagon working for regime change in Tehran,
Franklin needed to get out a simple message: We didn’t
know about Chalabi’s secret dealings with Iran.

Franklin decided to leak the information to a friendly
contact in the media: Adam Ciralsky, a CBS producer who
had been fired from the CIA, allegedly for his close ties
to Israel. On May 21st, the day after CBS broadcast its
exclusive report on Chalabi, Franklin phoned Ciralsky and
fed him the information. As the two men talked,
eavesdroppers at the FBI’s Washington field office
recorded the conversation.

That night, Stahl followed up her original report
with ""new details""—the information leaked earlier that day
by Franklin. She began, however, by making clear that she
would not divulge the most explosive detail of all: the
fact that Chalabi had wrecked the NSA’s ability to
eavesdrop on Iran. ""Senior intelligence officials were
stressing today that the information Ahmed Chalabi is
alleged to have passed on to Iran is so seriously
sensitive that the result of full disclosure would be
highly damaging to U.S. security,"" Stahl said. ""Because of
that, we are not reporting the details of what exactly
Chalabi is said to have compromised, at the request of
U.S. officials at the highest levels. The information
involves secrets that were held by only a handful of very
senior intelligence officials."" Thanks to the pressure
from the administration, the public was prevented from
learning the most damaging aspect of Chalabi’s treachery.

Then Stahl moved on to Franklin’s central
message. ""Meanwhile,"" she said, ""we have been told that
grave concerns about the true nature of Chalabi’s
relationship with Iran started after the U.S. obtained,
quote, ?undeniable intelligence’ that Chalabi met with a
senior Iranian intelligence officer, a, quote, ?nefarious
figure from the dark side of the regime, an individual
with a direct hand in covert operations against the United
States.’ Chalabi never reported this meeting to anyone in
the U.S. government, including his friends and sponsors.""
In short, the Pentagon—and Feith’s office in particular—
was blameless.

VI. The Cabal’s Triumph

Soon after the broadcast, David Szady’s team at the FBI
decided to wrap up its investigation before Franklin
leaked any more information. Agents quietly confronted
Franklin with the taped phone call and pressured him to
cooperate in a sting operation directed at AIPAC and
members of Feith’s team in the Pentagon. Franklin, facing
a long prison sentence, agreed. On August 4th, 2005, Rosen
and Weissman were indicted, and on January 20th, 2006,
Franklin, who had earlier pleaded guilty, was sentenced to
twelve years and seven months in prison. In an attempt to
reduce his sentence, he agreed to testify against the
former AIPAC officials. The case is set to go to trial
this fall.

So far, however, Franklin is the only member of Feith’s
team to face charges. The continuing lack of indictments
demonstrates how frighteningly easy it is for a small
group of government officials to join forces with agents
of foreign powers—whether it is AIPAC or the MEK or the
INC—to sell the country on a disastrous war.

The most glaring unindicted co-conspirator is Ahmed
Chalabi. Even top-ranking Republicans suspect him of
double dealing: ""I wouldn’t be surprised if he told
Iranians facts, issues, whatever, that we did not want
them to know,"" said Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., who chairs
the House subcommittee on national security. Yet the FBI
has been unable to so much as question Chalabi as part of
its ongoing espionage case. Last November, when Chalabi
returned to the United States for a series of speeches and
media events, the FBI tried to interview him. But because
he was under State Department protection during his visit,
sources in the Justice Department say, the bureau’s
request was flatly denied.

""Chalabi’s running around saying, ?I have nothing to
hide,’ "" says one senior FBI official. ""Yet he’s using our
State Department to keep us from him at the same time. And
we’ve got to keep our mouth shut.""

In the end, the work of Franklin and the other members of
Feith’s secret office had the desired effect. Working
behind the scenes, the members of the Office of Special
Plans succeeded in setting the United States on the path
to all-out war with Iran. Indeed, since Bush was re-
elected to a second term, he has made no secret of his
desire to see Tehran fall. In a victory speech of sorts on
Inauguration Day in January 2005, Vice President Dick
Cheney warned bluntly that Iran was ""right at the top"" of
the administration’s list of ""trouble spots""—and that
Israel ""might well decide to act first"" by attacking Iran.
The Israelis, Cheney added in an obvious swipe at
moderates in the State Department, would ""let the rest of
the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess
afterward.""

Over the past six months, the administration has adopted
almost all of the hard-line stance advocated by the war
cabal in the Pentagon. In May, Bush’s ambassador to the
United Nations, John Bolton, appeared before AIPAC’s
annual conference and warned that Iran ""must be made aware
that if it continues down the path of international
isolation, there will be tangible and painful
consequences."" To back up the tough talk, the State
Department is spending $66 million to promote political
change inside Iran—funding the same kind of dissident
groups that helped drive the U.S. to war in Iraq. ""We may
face no greater challenge from a single country than from
Iran,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared.

In addition, the State Department recently beefed up its
Iran Desk from two people to ten, hired more Farsi
speakers and set up eight intelligence units in foreign
countries to focus on Iran. The administration’s National
Security Strategy—the official policy document that sets
out U.S. strategic priorities—now calls Iran the ""single
country"" that most threatens U.S. interests.

The shift in official policy has thrilled former members
of the cabal. To them, the war in Lebanon represents the
final step in their plan to turn Iran into the next Iraq.
Ledeen, writing in the National Review on July 13th, could
hardly restrain himself. ""Faster, please,"" he urged the
White House, arguing that the war should now be taken over
by the U.S. military and expanded across the entire
region. ""The only way we are going to win this war is to
bring down those regimes in Tehran and Damascus, and they
are not going to fall as a result of fighting between
their terrorist proxies in Gaza and Lebanon on the one
hand, and Israel on the other. Only the United States can
accomplish it,"" he concluded. ""There is no other way.""

By Philip Gordon

Just a few months into the Trump administration, it still isn’t clear what course the president’s foreign policy will ultimately take. What is clear, however, is that the impulsiveness, combativeness, and recklessness that characterized Donald Trump’s election campaign have survived the transition into the presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued to challenge accepted norms, break with diplomatic traditions, and respond to perceived slights or provocations with insults or threats of his own. The core of his foreign policy message is that the United States will no longer allow itself to be taken advantage of by friends or foes abroad. After decades of “losing” to other countries, he says he is going to put “America first” and start winning again.

It could be that Trump is simply staking out tough bargaining positions as a tactical matter, the approach to negotiations he has famously called “the art of the deal.” President Richard Nixon long ago developed the “madman theory,” the idea that he could frighten his adversaries into believing he was so volatile he might do something crazy if they failed to meet his demands—a tactic that Trump, whose reputation for volatility is firmly established, seems particularly well suited to employ.

The problem, however, is that negotiations sometimes fail, and adversaries are themselves often brazen and unpredictable. After all, Nixon’s madman theory—designed to force the North Vietnamese to compromise—did not work. Moreover, putting the theory into practice requires the capacity to act judiciously at the appropriate moment, something that Trump, as president, has yet to demonstrate. And whereas a failed business deal allows both parties to walk away unscathed if disappointed, a failed diplomatic gambit can lead to political instability, costly trade disputes, the proliferation of dangerous weapons, or even war. History is littered with examples of leaders who, like Trump, came to power fueled by a sense of national grievance and promises to force adversaries into submission, only to end up mired in a military, diplomatic, or economic conflict they would come to regret.

Will that happen to Trump? Nobody knows. But what if one could? What if, like Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, Trump could meet a ghost from the future offering a vision of where his policies might lead by the end of his term before he decides on them at its start?
It is possible that such a ghost would show him a version of the future in which his administration, after a turbulent start, moderated over time, proved more conventional than predicted, and even had some success in negotiating, as he has pledged, “better deals.” But there is a real risk that events will turn out far worse—a future in which Trump’s erratic style and confrontational policies destroy an already fragile world order and lead to open conflict—in the most likely cases, with Iran, China, or North Korea.

In the narratives that follow, everything described as having taken place before mid-March 2017 actually happened. That which takes place after that date is—at least at the time of publication—fiction.

**STUMBLING INTO WAR WITH IRAN**


It is September 2017, and the White House is consumed with a debate about options for escalation with Iran. Another dozen Americans have been killed in an Iranian-sponsored attack on U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and the president is frustrated that previous air strikes in Iran failed to deter this sort of deadly aggression. He is tempted to retaliate much more aggressively this time but also knows that doing so risks involving U.S. troops even further in what is already a costly and unpopular war—the very sort of “mess” he had promised to avoid. Looking back, he now sees that this conflict probably became inevitable when he named his foreign policy team and first started to implement his new approach toward Iran.
Well before his election, of course, Trump had criticized the Iran nuclear agreement as “the worst deal ever negotiated” and promised to put a stop to Iran’s “aggressive push to destabilize and dominate” the Middle East. Some of his top advisers were deeply hostile to Iran and known to favor a more confrontational approach, including his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; his CIA director, Mike Pompeo; his chief strategist, Steve Bannon; and his defense secretary, James Mattis. Some of Mattis’ former military colleagues said he had a 30-year-long obsession with Iran, noting, as one marine told Politico, “It’s almost like he wants to get even with them.”

During his campaign and first months in office, Trump whipped up anti-Iranian feelings and consistently misled the public about what the nuclear deal entailed. He falsely insisted that the United States “received absolutely nothing” from it, that it permitted Iran to eventually get the bomb, and that it gave $150 billion to Iran (apparently referring to a provision of the deal that allowed Iran to access some $50 billion of its own money that had been frozen in foreign accounts). Critics claimed that the rhetoric was reminiscent of the Bush administration’s exaggerations of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs in the run-up to the Iraq war. In February 2017, in response to an Iranian ballistic missile test, Flynn brashly declared that he was “officially putting Iran on notice.” Two days later, the administration announced a range of new sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and companies involved in the ballistic missile program.

Perhaps just as predictably, Iran dismissed the administration’s tough talk. It continued to test its missiles, insisting that neither the nuclear deal nor UN Security Council resolutions prohibited it from doing so. Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, even taunted Trump for his controversial immigration and travel ban, thanking him on Twitter for revealing the “true face” of the United States. Tehran also continued its policy of shipping arms to the Houthi rebels in Yemen and providing military assistance to Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, neither of which proved particularly costly to the Iranian treasury. U.S. efforts to get Russia to limit Iran’s role in Syria were ignored, adding to the White House’s frustration.
To the surprise of many, growing U.S. pressure on Iran did not immediately lead to the collapse of the nuclear deal. As soon as he took office, Trump ended the Obama administration’s practice of encouraging banks and international companies to ensure that Iran benefited economically from the deal. And he expressed support for congressional plans to sanction additional Iranian entities for terrorism or human rights violations, as top officials insisted was permitted by the nuclear deal. Iran complained that these “backdoor” sanctions would violate the agreement yet took no action. By March 2017, U.S. officials were concluding internally—and some of the administration’s supporters began to gloat—that Trump’s tougher approach was succeeding.

Different behavior on either side could have prevented relations from deteriorating. But ultimately, the deal could not be sustained. In the early summer of 2017, real signs of trouble started to emerge. Under pressure from hardline factions within Iran, which had their own interest in spiking the deal, Tehran had continued its provocative behavior, including the unjustified detention of dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, throughout the spring. In June, after completing a review of his Iran policy, Trump put Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations and announced that continued sanctions relief would be contingent on Iran’s release of all U.S. detainees and a return to negotiations to address the nuclear deal’s “flaws.” Instead of submitting to these demands, Iran responded with defiance. Its new president, a hard-liner who had defeated Hassan Rouhani in the May 2017 election, declared that in the face of U.S. “noncompliance,” Iran would resume certain prohibited nuclear activities, including testing advanced centrifuges and expanding its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. Washington was suddenly abuzz with talk of the need for a new effort to choke off Iran economically or even a preventive military strike.

The Trump administration had been confident that other countries would back its tougher approach and had warned allies and adversaries alike that they must choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States. But the pressure did not work as planned. China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom all said that the deal had been working before the United States sought to renegotiate it, and they blamed Washington for precipitating the crisis. The EU even passed legislation making it illegal for European companies to cooperate with U.S. secondary sanctions. Trump fumed and vowed they would pay for their betrayal.

As the United States feuded with its closest partners, tensions with Iran escalated further. Frustrated by continued Iranian support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Pentagon stepped up patrols in the Strait of Hormuz and loosened the rules of engagement for U.S. forces. When an Iranian patrol boat aggressively approached a U.S. cruiser, in circumstances that are still disputed, the U.S. ship responded with deadly defensive force, killing 25 Iranian sailors.

The outrage in Iran bolstered support for the regime and led to widespread calls for revenge, which the country’s new president could not resist. Less than a week later, the Iranian-backed militia group Kataib Hezbollah killed six U.S. soldiers in Iraq. With the American public demanding retaliation, some called for diplomacy, recalling how, in January 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke directly to defuse the situation after U.S. sailors drifted into Iranian waters. This time, the EU offered to mediate the crisis.

But the administration wanted nothing to do with what it considered the Obama administration’s humiliating appeasement of Iran. Instead, to teach Iran a lesson, Trump authorized a cruise missile strike on a known Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intelligence headquarters, destroying three buildings and killing a dozen officers and an unknown number of civilians.

Trump’s advisers predicted that Iran would back down, but as nationalist fervor grew in Iran, Tehran escalated the conflict, calculating that the American public had no desire to spend more blood or treasure in the Middle East. Kataib Hezbollah and other Shiite militias in Iraq, some directed by Iran and others acting independently, launched further attacks on U.S. personnel. Tehran forced the weak government in Baghdad to demand the Americans’ departure from Iraq, which would deal a huge blow to the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State, or ISIS.
As Washington reimposed the sanctions that had been suspended by the nuclear deal, Iran abandoned the limits on its enrichment of uranium, expelled the UN monitors, and announced that it was no longer bound by the agreement. With the CIA concluding that Iran was now back on the path to a nuclear weapons capability, Trump’s top advisers briefed the president in the Oval Office. Some counseled restraint, but others, led by Bannon and Mattis, insisted that the only credible option was to destroy the Iranian nuclear infrastructure with a massive preventive strike, while reinforcing the U.S. presence in Iraq to deal with the likely Iranian retaliation. Pompeo, a longstanding advocate of regime change in Iran, argued that such a strike might also lead to a popular uprising and the ousting of the supreme leader, an encouraging notion that Trump himself had heard think-tank experts endorse on television.

Once again, nervous allies stepped in and tried to broker a diplomatic solution. They tried to put the 2015 nuclear deal back in place, arguing that it now looked attractive by comparison. But it was too late. U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Arak, Fordow, Isfahan, Natanz, and Parchin led to retaliatory counterstrikes against U.S. forces in Iraq, U.S. retaliation against targets in Iran, terrorist attacks against Americans in Europe and the Middle East, and vows from Tehran to rebuild its nuclear program bigger and better than before. The president who had vowed to stop squandering American lives and resources in the Middle East now found himself wondering how he had ended up at war there.

**FIGHTING CHINA**

It is October 2017, and experts are calling it the most dangerous confrontation between nuclear powers since the Cuban missile crisis. After a U.S.-Chinese trade war escalated well beyond what either side had predicted, a clash in the South China Sea has led to casualties on both sides and heavy exchanges of fire between the U.S. and Chinese navies. There are rumors that China has placed its nuclear forces on high alert. The conflict that so many long feared has begun.

Of the many foreign targets of Trump’s withering criticism during the campaign and the early months of his presidency, China topped the list. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly accused the country of destroying American jobs and stealing U.S. secrets. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country,” he said. Bannon, who early in the administration set up a shadow national security council in the White House, had even predicted conflict with China. “We’re going to war in the South China Sea in five to ten years,” he said in March 2016. “There’s no doubt about that.”

Not long after the election, Trump took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, breaking with decades of diplomatic tradition and suggesting a potential change in the United States’ “one China” policy. It wasn’t clear whether the move was inadvertent or deliberate, but either way, Trump defended his approach and insisted that the policy was up for negotiation unless China made concessions on trade. “Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?” he tweeted. “I don’t think so!” In February 2017, after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump announced that the United States would honor the “one China” policy after all. Asia experts were relieved, but it must have infuriated the president that so many thought he had backed down. “Trump lost his first fight with Xi and he will be looked at as a paper tiger,” Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University of China, told The New York Times.

There were other early warning signs of the clashes to come. At his confirmation hearings for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson appeared to draw a new redline in the South China Sea, noting that China’s access to islands there “is not going to be allowed.” Some dismissed the statement as overblown rhetoric, but Beijing did not. The state-run China Daily warned that any attempt to enforce such a policy could lead to a “devastating confrontation,” and the Global Times said it could lead to “large-scale war.”

Then there were the disputes about trade. To head the new White House National Trade Council, Trump nominated Peter Navarro, the author of The Coming China Wars, Death by China, and other provocative books that describe U.S.-Chinese relations in zero-sum terms and argue for increased U.S. tariffs and trade sanctions. Like Bannon, Navarro regularly invoked the specter of military conflict with Beijing, and he argued that tougher economic measures were necessary not only to rectify the U.S.-Chinese trade balance but also to weaken China’s military power, which he claimed would inevitably be used against the United States. The early rhetoric worried many observers, but they took solace in the idea that neither side could afford a confrontation.

It was the decisions that followed that made war all but inevitable. In June 2017, when North Korea tested yet another long-range missile, which brought it closer to having the ability to strike the United States, Trump demanded that China check its small ally and announced “serious consequences” if it refused. China had no interest in promoting North Korea’s nuclear capacity, but it worried that completely isolating Pyongyang, as Trump was demanding, could cause the regime to collapse—sending millions of poor North Korean refugees streaming into China and leaving behind a united Korea ruled by Seoul, armed with North Korea’s nuclear weapons, and allied with Washington. China agreed to another UN Security Council statement condemning North Korea and extended a suspension of coal imports from the country but refused to take further action. Angry about Trump’s incessant criticism and confrontation over trade, Xi saw the United States as a greater danger to China than North Korea was and said he refused to be bullied by Washington.

At the same time, the U.S. current account deficit with China had swelled, in part because growing U.S. budget deficits required borrowing from abroad, thus driving up the value of the dollar. That, combined with Chinese intransigence over North Korea, convinced the White House that it was time to get tough. Outside experts, along with Trump’s own secretary of state and secretary of the treasury, cautioned against the risks of a dangerous escalation, but the president dismissed their hand-wringing and said that the days of letting China take advantage of Americans were over. In July, the administration formally branded China a “currency manipulator” (despite evidence that it had actually been spending its currency reserves to uphold the value of the yuan) and imposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. To the delight of the crowd at a campaign-style rally in Florida, Trump announced that these new measures would remain in place until China boosted the value of its currency, bought more U.S. goods, and imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea.

The president’s more hawkish advisers assured him that China’s response would prove limited, given its dependence on exports and its massive holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds. But they underestimated the intense nationalism that the U.S. actions had stoked. Xi had to show strength, and he hit back.

Within days, Xi announced that China was taking the United States to the World Trade Organization over the import tariff (a case he felt certain China would win) and imposed a 45 percent counter tariff on U.S. imports. The Chinese believed that the reciprocal tariffs would hurt the United States more than China (since Americans bought far more Chinese goods than the other way around) and knew that the resulting inflation—especially for goods such as clothing, shoes, toys, and electronics—would hurt Trump’s blue-collar constituency. Even more important, they felt they were more willing to make sacrifices than the Americans were.

Xi also instructed China’s central bank to sell $100 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds, a move that immediately drove up U.S. interest rates and knocked 800 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in a single day. That China started using some of the cash resulting from the sales to buy large stakes in major U.S. companies at depressed prices only fueled a nationalist reaction in the United States. Trump tapped into it, calling for a new law to block Chinese investment.

With personal insults flying back and forth across the Pacific, Trump announced that if China did not start treating the United States fairly, Washington might reconsider the “one China” policy after all. Encouraged by Bannon, who argued privately that it was better to have the inevitable confrontation with China while the United States still enjoyed military superiority, Trump speculated publicly about inviting the president of Taiwan to the White House and selling new antimissile systems and submarines to the island.

China responded that any change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan would be met with an “overwhelming response,” which experts interpreted to mean at a minimum cutting off trade with Taiwan (which sends 30 percent of its exports to China) and at a maximum military strikes against targets on the island. With over one billion Chinese on the mainland passionately committed to the country’s nominal unity, few doubted that Beijing meant what it said. On October 1, China’s normally tepid National Day celebrations turned into a frightening display of anti-Americanism.

It was in this environment that an incident in the South China Sea led to the escalation so many had feared. The details remain murky, but it was triggered when a U.S. surveillance ship operating in disputed waters in heavy fog accidentally rammed a Chinese trawler that was harassing it. In the confusion that ensued, a People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate fired on the unarmed U.S. ship, a U.S. destroyer sank the Chinese frigate, and a Chinese torpedo struck and badly damaged the destroyer, killing three Americans.

A U.S. aircraft carrier task force is being rushed to the region, and China has deployed additional attack submarines there and begun aggressive overflights and patrols throughout the South China Sea. Tillerson is seeking to reach his Chinese counterpart, but officials in Beijing wonder whether he even speaks for the administration and fear Trump will accept nothing short of victory. Leaked U.S. intelligence estimates suggest that a large-scale conflict could quickly lead to hundreds of thousands of casualties, draw in neighboring states, and destroy trillions of dollars’ worth of economic output. But with nationalism raging in both countries, neither capital sees a way to back down. All Trump wanted to do was get a better deal from China.

**THE NEXT KOREAN WAR**

It is December 2018, and North Korea has just launched a heavy artillery barrage against targets in Seoul, killing thousands, or perhaps tens of thousands; it is too soon to say. U.S. and South Korean forces—now unified under U.S. command, according to the provisions of the Mutual Defense Treaty—have fired artillery and rockets at North Korea’s military positions and launched air strikes against its advanced air defense network. From a bunker somewhere near Pyongyang, the country’s erratic dictator, Kim Jong Un, has issued a statement promising to “burn Seoul and Tokyo to the ground”—a reference to North Korea’s stockpile of nuclear and chemical weapons—if the “imperialist” forces do not immediately cease their attacks.

Washington had expected some sort of a North Korean response when it preemptively struck the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States, fulfilling Trump’s pledge to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring that ability. But few thought North Korea would go so far as to risk its own destruction by attacking South Korea. Now, Trump must decide whether to continue with the war and risk nuclear escalation—or accept what will be seen as a humiliating retreat. Some of his advisers are urging him to quickly finish the job, whereas others warn that doing so would cost the lives of too many of the 28,000 U.S. soldiers stationed on the peninsula, to say nothing of the ten million residents of Seoul. Assembled in the White House Situation Room, Trump and his aides ponder their terrible options.

How did it come to this? Even Trump’s harshest critics acknowledge that the United States had no good choices in North Korea. For more than 20 years, the paranoid, isolated regime in Pyongyang had developed its nuclear and missile capabilities and seemed impervious to incentives and disincentives alike. The so-called Agreed Framework, a 1994 deal to halt North Korea’s nuclear program, fell apart in 2003 when Pyongyang was caught violating it, leading the George W. Bush administration to abandon the deal in favor of tougher sanctions. Multiple rounds of talks since then produced little progress. By 2017, experts estimated that North Korea possessed more than a dozen nuclear warheads and was stockpiling the material for more. They also thought North Korea had missiles capable of delivering those warheads to targets throughout Asia and was testing missiles that could give it the capacity to strike the West Coast of the United States by 2023.

Early in the administration, numerous outside experts and former senior officials urged Trump to make North Korea a top priority. Accepting that total dismantlement of the country’s nuclear and missile programs was not a realistic near term goal, most called for negotiations that would offer a package of economic incentives and security assurances in exchange for a halt to further testing and development. A critical component, they argued, would be outreach to China, the only country that might be able to influence North Korea.

But the administration preferred a more confrontational approach. Even before Trump took office, when Kim blustered about developing the capacity to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon, Trump responded on Twitter: “It won’t happen!” On February 12, 2017, North Korea fired a test missile 310 miles into the Sea of Japan at the very moment Trump was meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate, in Florida. The next morning, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, announced that the United States would soon be sending a signal to North Korea in the form of a major military buildup that would show “unquestioned military strength beyond anything anyone can imagine.” Later that month, Trump announced plans for a $54 billion increase in U.S. defense spending for 2018, with corresponding cuts in the budget for diplomacy. And in March 2017, Tillerson traveled to Asia and declared that “the political and diplomatic efforts of the past 20 years” had failed and that a “new approach” was needed.

In the ensuing months, critics urged the administration to accompany its military buildup with regional diplomacy, but Trump chose otherwise. He made clear that U.S. foreign policy had changed. Unlike what his predecessor had done with Iran, he said, he was not going to reward bad behavior. Instead, the administration announced in the summer of 2018 that North Korea was “officially on notice.” Although the White House agreed with critics that the best way to pressure North Korea was through China, it proved impossible to cooperate with Beijing while erecting tariffs and attacking it for “raping” the United States economically.

Thus did the problem grow during the administration’s first two years. North Korea continued to test missiles and develop fissile material. It occasionally incited South Korea, launching shells across the demilitarized zone and provoking some near misses at sea. The war of words between Pyongyang and Washington also escalated—advisers could not get the president to bite his tongue in response to Kim’s outrageous taunts—and Trump repeated in even more colorful language his Twitter warning that he would not allow Pyongyang to test a nuclear-capable missile that could reach the United States.

When the intelligence community picked up signs that Pyongyang was about to do so, the National Security Council met, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed the president on his options. He could try to shoot down the test missile in flight, but shooting carried a high risk of missing, and even a successful intercept might provoke a military response. He could do nothing, but that would mean losing face and emboldening North Korea. Or he could destroy the test missile on its launch pad with a barrage of cruise missiles, blocking Pyongyang’s path to a nuclear deterrent, enforcing his redline, and sending a clear message to the rest of the world. Sources present at the meeting reported that when the president chose the third option, he said, “We have to start winning wars again.”

**LEARNING FROM THE FUTURE**

These frightening futures are far from inevitable. Indeed, for all the early bluster and promises of a dramatic break with the past, U.S. foreign policy may well turn out to be not as revolutionary or reckless as many fear. Trump has already demonstrated his ability to reverse course without compunction on a multitude of issues, from abortion to the Iraq war, and sound advice from some of his more seasoned advisers could moderate his potential for rash behavior.

On the other hand, given what we have seen so far of the president’s temperament, decision-making style, and foreign policy, these visions of what might lie ahead are hardly implausible: foreign policy disasters do happen. Imagine if a ghost from the future could have given world leaders in 1914 a glimpse of the cataclysm their policies would produce. Or if in 1965, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson could have seen what escalation in Vietnam would lead to a decade later. Or if in 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush could have been shown a preview of the results of the invasion of Iraq. In each case, unwise decisions, a flawed process, and wishful thinking did lead to a catastrophe that could have been, and often was, predicted in advance.

#General Introduction

India currently has [a population of 1.28 billion](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html). Its population is expected to increase throughout most of the 21st century, reaching its zenith of 1.75 billion around 2060 before beginning to contract, according to [the UN's medium fertility projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). Based on this projection, India will surpass China as the world's most populous country before 2030. As a developing country with a [population pyramid that's currently bottom-heavy](https://www.populationpyramid.net/india/2015/), India is projected to see a larger and larger proportion of its population reach older ages as the country develops throughout the century. The effect is a population pyramid that is expected to [flatten and lengthen proportionally](https://www.populationpyramid.net/india/2100/)--the country will enjoy a demographic windfall in the early part of the century and will likely see only mild problems related to population aging. According to a [2000 map](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/gpw-v3/gpw-v3-population-density/inddens.jpg), most of India's population centers (areas with more than a thousand inhabitants per square kilometer) are situated in the [humid subtropical areas of its north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_India#/media/File:India_climatic_zone_map_en.svg), near the borders of Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as on its tropical wet southwestern and western coasts.

&nbsp;

During the summer of 2018, NITI Aayog --an Indian government think tank-- reported that the country is ""[currently suffering from the worst water crisis in its history](http://niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/new_initiatives/presentation-on-CWMI.pdf)"" (non-HTTPS PDF). 600 million people across the country are facing ""high to extreme"" water stress due to their lack of access to clean water. This has resulted in around 200,000 deaths per year from polluted water. The report said that 70 percent of India's water is contaminated and highlighted the severely underdeveloped state of India's water infrastructure. The overall situation is not likely to improve in the future, as increasing development and a growing population will lead to an increase in water demand, which the report predicted to be double the available supply by 2030. The report also noted that water shortage will lead to significant food security risks for the country.

[*Full NITI Aayog water management report*](http://pibphoto.nic.in/documents/rlink/2018/jun/p201861401.pdf) *(non-HTTPS PDF via third party--proceed with caution.)*

&nbsp;

Most of India is [agricultural land (60.5%) that is arable (52.8%)](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html). By land area, this makes it ""[the second largest in the world, after the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_India#Output)"", despite only having [roughly a third of the United State's land area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area). However, there is evidence that the large amount of land is not being used to its full potential, and that there is room for India to make massive gains in output of all major agricultural products by improving its productivity (tonnes per hectare) so that it is close to those of developed countries. The largest hurdle towards this is the country's underdevelopment--as the [World Bank's 2008 overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_India#Problems) reported, ""Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation."" The lack of cold storage, food packaging, and safe and efficient transport system results in one of the world's highest food spoilage rates, according to the Wikipedia entry. Despite its underperformance, India is still the sixth-largest net exporter of agricultural goods as of 2013 and its agricultural sector accounts for 15% of its total GDP. Due to the ongoing water crisis that's unlikely to be resolved and likely to intensify, it seems likely that agricultural productivity will decrease.

&nbsp;

Depending on whether the European Union is counted as a country, [India ranks third or fourth in terms of GDP (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP\)), sitting comfortably between the United States and Japan with USD 9.5 trillion. Per capita, [India ranks 119-127 with roughly USD 7,100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP\)_per_capita), and is positioned between Uzbekistan and Laos. It should come as no surprise that India has one of the most uneven wealth distributions in the world, and that this is growing--[in 2012, the top 1% had 28.7% of wealth](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=FB790DB0-C175-0E07-787A2B8639253D5A) (PDF), behind only Indonesia and the United States (based on available data). This was a 10 percentage point increase over the 15.7% recorded in 2002. Despite having services account for 61.5% of GDP, ""slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture"". ""The outlook for India's long-term growth is moderately positive due to a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy"" ([World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html)). However, there are considerable headwinds such as the water and potential food security issues raised earlier in this introduction, as well as issues with the country's underdevelopment and overpopulation in general. 

&nbsp;

Bangalore, one center of the country's information technology industry, is considered the most dynamic city in the world --more so than Silicon Valley-- [according to Jones Lang LaSalle](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/indias-rising-sectors/). The country is the world's top exporter of information and communication technology, according to the [Global Innovation Index](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_gii_2017.pdf) (PDF)--its large and educated English-speaking population allowed it to become the top information technology services exporter, as well as a destination for outsourcing and a source of programmers for western nations. Overall, the country is ranked 60 on said index, with a score of 35.5/100. Key weaknesses include education and the business environment, while strengths include the number of science and engineering graduates, elite universities that are globally competetive, high R&D spending by global companies, and a massive domestic market. India's technology profile bears some resemblance to China's.

&nbsp;

*Most of the following section on climate change will be based on* [Climate: Observations, projections and impacts: India](https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2040/12/India.pdf) *(PDF), published by the University of Nottinghham:*

A wide range of temperatures is experienced across India because of its varied geography. Despite that, India is generally considered a hot country, as many regions experience temperatures greater than 35C during summer. With temperatures projected to increase 3C in the south and 4.5C in the north under the A1B emissions scenario (CMIP3), the risk of deadly heatwaves will be significantly higher. This is especially significant in the northern humid subtropical region, which contains many population centers--the combination of humidity and high heat will lead to high [wet bulb temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature#Wet-bulb_temperature_and_health) in the densely populated region (""A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan""). [A global study](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/22/humidity-may-prove-breaking-point-for-some-areas-as-temperatures-rise-says-study/) concluded that India is the most at risk from high wet bulb temperatures, as the northern region most affected is also the most densely populated.

&nbsp;

Rainfall is expected to increase 5-10% across the country, though there are significant uncertainties with this projection. ""Water stress could increase in India with climate change"" was the consensus of various studies, although there are large variations on details such as magnitude. Wheat and rice --the country's two most valuable exports-- are generally projected to see declines along with mustard and soybean, while coconut yields could increase. There exists high uncertainty in projections of extreme climactic events like extreme precipitation, extreme flooding, and tropical cyclones. There is broad consensus that India is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, with the number affected ranging from 7.6 million to 21 million people.

&nbsp;

Many of the challenges India faces could be solved by developing its rural areas. Unfortunately, the large wealth disparity, the intense water crisis, and the apparent lack of will to solve such a pressing and fundamental problem point towards a country that will not be likely to develop quick enough to meet challenges presented by and intensified by climate change. However, with India's technological capacity, it is possible that innovative solutions will appear. It is this writer's opinion that the country will likely see humanitarian crises of historic proportions and might see increasing amounts of widespread civil unrest in rural areas over this century.

#Questions

* The densely-populated northern part of the country is likely to experience deadly wet bulb temperatures that might make it uninhabitable--when combined with severe water shortage and consequent food security issues, it is likely that India will generate many prospective refugees. Where would they head towards? Keep in mind that Pakistan and India have historically been hostile to each other and that China seems very unlikely to let in large amounts of refugees due to its culture and its own resource issues, while minor neighbours such as Nepal, Bangladesh, and Nepal would likely shut their doors out of fear of getting overwhelmed. 

* India is supposed to be the west's counterweight to China on the Asian continent. However, the largest democracy in the world is deeply entangled with China as it is India's largest trading partner, with the United States trailing behind by ten billion in total trade. Relations are said to be friendly despite frequent border conflicts between the neighbours. With climate change potentially leading to a weaker and divided India, what sort of vulnerabilities will open up, and how might they be used by the east and/or the west? 

* Combining most of what we've covered so far--how will climate change affect the consolidation of the [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership), of which India is a potential member?

27,"What is the DPRK's goal with obtaining nukes? Do you really think they want to extort America and break up the alliance with the South, like the CIA recent assessment? Or is it for defensive purposes / regieme security?",66.0,7tjfs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/7tjfs7/what_is_the_dprks_goal_with_obtaining_nukes_do/,67.0,1517133142.0,"To sum up what I understand is the new CIA assessment of the DPRK's goals: The DPRK wants the world to recognize them as a nuclear power. They want to threaten the US with nukes to eventually make them remove their military that is stationed in South Korea, and break up the US alliance with South Korea, not to mention the international coalition against them. Their goal might then shift to uniting the Korean Peninsula under their control somehow.

I feel like the CIA's recent assessment of the DPRK's goals is the US justifying the risk they are taking pressuring the Kim regime. It also seems to be the US excuse for not engaging in talks and a reaction to the South's attempts at talks with the DPRK. It seems to be a new assessment / new way of thinking about the DPRK's goals. It's like we are attributing goals to them that were not originally their goals, but logically I guess that could be their goal. It's a logical conclusion to a failed attempt at dialogue and containment, and the entire international coalition against the DPRK falling apart, and that seems to be a stretch of reality.

I find it unrealistic that the international coalition against them (and the fight against nuclear proliferation in general) could fall apart. I find it much more realistic that the DPRK only wants nukes for defense and regime security. I don't think the US should abandon the idea of dialogue and containment. Too many diplomatic failures would have to happen for that to fail, and the risk of a conflict with the DPRK escalating is too much of a catastrophic failure to risk.

The assessment also seems to make the assumption that the DPRK doesn't care about sanctions at all, that they will let their people starve and just look for illegal ways to support their military and weapons program. I think the DPRK cares about them, but they see no way out, and no one is showing them a way out. Trumps irrationally (if miscalculated use of Twitter) pressuring them on Twitter is causing that. Their people are starving... the sanctions are working. Yet the sanctions aren't being used correctly. It's not the choices they are making it's the choices they are left with.",geopolitics,CIA

#General Introductions

With this post we have finally left the old world and entered the new world, six months after the series began. 

South America has been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook, from which a large portion of the information found in the spreadsheet was taken from. The region under discussion is comprised of the following five countries (listed by population; descending):

* Argentina

* Chile

* Bolivia

* Paraguay

* Uruguay

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

&nbsp;

#Observations

* Argentina, the most populous country in the region, is projected to see its population grow roughly 30% this century, while Bolivia, the third most populous, is projected to see roughly 50% growth. Chile and Paraguay are projected to see much more modest growths, and Uruguay will be in the midst of a steep decline by the end of the century.

* Population pyramids of the region suggest they are in the mid-range of development, as many of them have relatively slight bulges around their bottom and lower-mid age brackets. Bolivia's bottom-heavy profile reflects its relatively low level of development, while Uruguay's comparatively flat profile suggests a higher level of development.

* Though there are inconsistencies with poverty line estimates used by the source, there seems to be a high level of impoverishment in the region, with Bolivia having particularly high rates of impoverishment. The region's average GDP PPP per capita is $17,700, with Bolivia ($7,600) and Chile ($24,600) being range-defining outliers. This puts the region at the same level of wealth as southeastern Europe.

* Despite Chile having a high coastline-to-area ratio compared to non-island countries, sea level rise and its impacts do not seem to be of particular concern to its government. On the other hand, Argentina's main concern with sea level rise seems to be tourism (beaches, cliffs, and real estate), which is one of the main economic activities of the coastal region.

* Agriculture plays a relatively large role in the region's economies. Agricultural land is plentiful, though the vast majority is permanent pasture. Per capita food production in the region is adequate, with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay each producing 12,000 - 25,000 Calories per capita per day, while Chile and Bolivia each produce 3,000 - 7,000 Calories. Most countries have indicated that their agriculture sectors are among the most vulnerable to climate change, and project that many crops will see significant declines in yields. Argentina has projected that yields of soybeans and corn will increase ""considerably and moderately, respectively"", though its findings are not echoed by other countries.

* The region has an abundance of freshwater, with per capita renewable internal freshwater resources averaging at 26,000 m3. Argentina (6,800 m3) and Chile (50,000 m3) are the range-defining outliers. Despite this, the relatively low level of development means that there are many locales without adequate water infrastructure, and this is reflected by the apparently low amount of irrigated farmland in the region. The information contained within the UNFCCC communications and other sources do not provide enough information for me to write an observation on the impacts of climate change on the region.

31,[Q&A] Trump May Have Helped ‘Reestablish Deterrence’ by Killing Suleimani: The former U.S. commander and CIA director says Iran’s “very fragile” situation may limit its response.,52.0,ekdewd,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ekdewd/qa_trump_may_have_helped_reestablish_deterrence/,43.0,1578233193.0,"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/03/petraeus-on-qassem-suleimani-killing-says-trump-helped-reestablish-deterrence/

As a former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and a former CIA director, retired Gen. David Petraeus is keenly familiar with Qassem Suleimani, the powerful chief of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad Friday morning.

After months of a muted U.S. response to Tehran’s repeated lashing out—the downing of a U.S. military drone, a devastating attack on Saudi oil infrastructure, and more—Suleimani’s killing was designed to send a pointed message to the regime that the United States will not tolerate continued provocation, he said.

Petraeus spoke to Foreign Policy on Friday about the implications of an action he called “more significant than the killing of Osama bin Laden.” This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Foreign Policy: What impact will the killing of Gen. Suleimani have on regional tensions?

David Petraeus: It is impossible to overstate the importance of this particular action. It is more significant than the killing of Osama bin Laden or even the death of [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi. Suleimani was the architect and operational commander of the Iranian effort to solidify control of the so-called Shia crescent, stretching from Iran to Iraq through Syria into southern Lebanon. He is responsible for providing explosives, projectiles, and arms and other munitions that killed well over 600 American soldiers and many more of our coalition and Iraqi partners just in Iraq, as well as in many other countries such as Syria. So his death is of enormous significance.

The question of course is how does Iran respond in terms of direct action by its military and Revolutionary Guard Corps forces? And how does it direct its proxies—the Iranian-supported Shia militia in Iraq and Syria and southern Lebanon, and throughout the world?

FP: Two previous administrations have reportedly considered this course of action and dismissed it. Why did Trump act now? 

DP: The reasoning seems to be to show in the most significant way possible that the U.S. is just not going to allow the continued violence—the rocketing of our bases, the killing of an American contractor, the attacks on shipping, on unarmed drones—without a very significant response.

Many people had rightly questioned whether American deterrence had eroded somewhat because of the relatively insignificant responses to the earlier actions. This clearly was of vastly greater importance. Of course it also, per the Defense Department statement, was a defensive action given the reported planning and contingencies that Suleimani was going to Iraq to discuss and presumably approve.

This was in response to the killing of an American contractor, the wounding of American forces, and just a sense of how this could go downhill from here if the Iranians don’t realize that this cannot continue. 

FP: Do you think this response was proportionate?


DP: It was a defensive response and this is, again, of enormous consequence and significance. But now the question is: How does Iran respond with its own forces and its proxies, and then what does that lead the U.S. to do? 

Iran is in a very precarious economic situation, it is very fragile domestically—they’ve killed many, many hundreds if not thousands of Iranian citizens who were demonstrating on the streets of Iran in response to the dismal economic situation and the mismanagement and corruption. I just don’t see the Iranians as anywhere near as supportive of the regime at this point as they were decades ago during the Iran-Iraq War. Clearly the supreme leader has to consider that as Iran considers the potential responses to what the U.S. has done.

It will be interesting now to see if there is a U.S. diplomatic initiative to reach out to Iran and to say, “Okay, the next move could be strikes against your oil infrastructure and your forces in your country—where does that end?”

FP: Will Iran consider this an act of war?

DP: I don’t know what that means, to be truthful. They clearly recognize how very significant it was. But as to the definition—is a cyberattack an act of war? No one can ever answer that. We haven’t declared war, but we have taken a very, very significant action.

FP: How prepared is the U.S. to protect its forces in the region?

DP: We’ve taken numerous actions to augment our air defenses in the region, our offensive capabilities in the region, in terms of general purpose and special operations forces and air assets. The Pentagon has considered the implications the potential consequences and has done a great deal to mitigate the risks—although you can’t fully mitigate the potential risks. 

FP: Do you think the decision to conduct this attack on Iraqi soil was overly provocative?

DP: Again what was the alternative? Do it in Iran? Think of the implications of that. This is the most formidable adversary that we have faced for decades. He is a combination of CIA director, JSOC [Joint Special Operations Command] commander, and special presidential envoy for the region. This is a very significant effort to reestablish deterrence, which obviously had not been shored up by the relatively insignificant responses up until now.

FP: What is the likelihood that there will be an all-out war?

DP: Obviously all sides will suffer if this becomes a wider war, but Iran has to be very worried that—in the state of its economy, the significant popular unrest and demonstrations against the regime—that this is a real threat to the regime in a way that we have not seen prior to this. 

FP: Given the maximum pressure campaign that has crippled its economy, the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, and now this assassination, what incentive does Iran have to negotiate now?

DP: The incentive would be to get out from under the sanctions, which are crippling. Could we get back to the Iran nuclear deal plus some additional actions that could address the shortcomings of the agreement?

This is a very significant escalation, and they don’t know where this goes any more than anyone else does. Yes, they can respond and they can retaliate, and that can lead to further retaliation—and that it is clear now that the administration is willing to take very substantial action. This is a pretty clarifying moment in that regard. 

FP: What will Iran do to retaliate?

DP: Right now they are probably doing what anyone does in this situation: considering the menu of options. There could be actions in the gulf, in the Strait of Hormuz by proxies in the regional countries, and in other continents where the Quds Force have activities. There’s a very considerable number of potential responses by Iran, and then there’s any number of potential U.S. responses to those actions 

Given the state of their economy, I think they have to be very leery, very concerned that that could actually result in the first real challenge to the regime certainly since the Iran-Iraq War. 

FP: Will the Iraqi government kick the U.S. military out of Iraq?

DP: The prime minister has said that he would put forward legislation to do that, although I don’t think that the majority of Iraqi leaders want to see that given that ISIS is still a significant threat. They are keenly aware that it was not the Iranian supported militias that defeated the Islamic State, it was U.S.-enabled Iraqi armed forces and special forces that really fought the decisive battles.",geopolitics,CIA
32,The Geopolitics of North Korea ---- The Red Line,46.0,gd9wlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gd9wlv/the_geopolitics_of_north_korea_the_red_line/,9.0,1588591802.0,"Myself and my team just finished an hour-long deep-dive show into the Geopolitics of North Korea, its foreign policy and what it means for the region. We also take a look into the likely outcomes of war, and where their nuclear program is up to at the moment.

For this episode we have  
ERIC GOMEZ >>> CATO Institutes director of Defence Policy Studies and East Asia expert  
JACOB BOGEL >>> Founder of AccessDPRK. The worlds most detailed open-source map of the DPRK  
SOO KIM >> RAND Corporation, CIA and the Department of Homeland Securities North Korea expert. 

One of the main focuses of the piece is about how important the nuclear program is to the Kim family, and how it completely changes the balance of power in the peninsula. We also go into what China, Russia, South Korea and the US are all hoping to gain from North Korea, and wether they are likely to achieve it. We even sat down with Eric and gamed out what a war between the North and South would actually look like, and the results were pretty surprising. 

Its designed to be a crash course on everything you would need to know about the situation, and we learned a lot making it.

We also decided to leave in some of the more controversial points, such as the NKs missile count, submarine programs and US nuclear response plan. 

The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks.

Would love your input and feedback as well.

33,IP theft is a common issue in a historical perspective and not just an issue of the Chinese government,43.0,9yfn35,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9yfn35/ip_theft_is_a_common_issue_in_a_historical/,15.0,1542623611.0,"Chinese IP theft isn't an isolated issue, when IP theft is basically done by all capable powers. I remember the time when Japanese companies were known for the activities of copy and stealing IP from the west. Japanese visitors became fake products presented which they made pictures off. Japanese cars in the 1960s and 1970s imitated American design language. Looking even further into history it was Germany before WW1 who copied British products, which made the parliament in London enforcing a **Made in xxx** label on products. The copied products from Germany were cheaper and had at least a comparable quality, which made **Made in Germany** popular. The Netherlands introduced an law for patents as late as in 1912. 

But of course history is developing and the US was accused of stealing IP via CIA and it's stations in NATO countries. At that time it was easy since all communication was done over analog lines or ISDN. [The case Enercon is an good example](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deutschlandfunk.de%2Fvorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html%3Fdram%3Aarticle_id%3D97135&edit-text=&act=url) / [Source](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/vorsicht-freund-hoert-mit.724.de.html?dram:article_id=97135). But of course it would be quite a lie, when the Germans were painted as innocent. [The German BND spied on Austrian companies for 20 years](https://derstandard.at/2000081647150/Die-Liste-Wen-der-deutsche-Geheimdienst-in-Oesterreich-ausspaehte)

Especially the collaboration of NATO intelligence services to fill gaps of knowledge and circumvent domestic laws was an issue for every domestic industry. The collection of meta data was opening the doors into the local networks. Another attack vector is of course the lack of multiple vendors for operative systems and network technology. Even when Chinese companies like Huawei under a suspicion, Cisco had in the last years so many problems with vulnerabilities and backdoors, that using such a product can be considered as careless. 

We must conclude that IP theft is wide spread and is not just done by China. The accusation of China as the evil is making blind for a solution of such a problem. It's obvious when governments are active supporting IP theft more laws don't help. And the IP theft by non governmental actors like companies is not negligible at all. The protection by laws will not work, when the incentive is that high. Even when a company is getting sanctioned and will declare bankruptcy the knowledge will be sold. Sanctions don't help either when they remove a market for the domestic industry. The development of laws for the protection of IP in various countries was made in most cases when the domestic industry was fully developed and had an advantage on some fields. 

The history about IP protection raises the question to which degree IP protection is outdated, when protection becomes quite expensive. The dream every country has to follow international treaties or will be punished can't be achieved. Companies are often careless, because of the cost of protection. We don't have even a network device certification. It's the reason why China has it's own Linux distribution and China has it's own network device vendors. This is a strategic advantage. The opportunity cost of software is quite a factor which prevents a landscape of competitors offering products focused on security. 

What's left is IMHO just the conclusion a country has to support innovation on all fronts as a long term strategy. Education in school, companies and university are key factors to prevent a decline. The collaboration of government and companies for the education of blue collar workers is extreme important to close the gap between academia and practical experience. Just pushing academics into the companies doesn't work.  The treatment of employees only as a human resource isn't a solution since it doesn't create respect and loyalty. The latter is a factor against IP theft.

#General Introductions

Due to the tiny populations of many island nations (e.g. Tonga, with 104,000; or Tuvalu, with 10,000 people) and their inconsequential GDPs, countries in the subregions will be grouped into one introduction.

&nbsp;

**Australia**

With [a population of 25 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Australia) spread over 7.7 million square kilometers of land, Australia is one of the most sparsley populated countries on the planet, [with 3.1 inhabitants per square kilometer](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3218.0Main%20Features752016?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=3218.0&issue=2016&num=&view=)--it is a country the size of the United States, but with fourteen times fewer inhabitants. This is due to a [climate that is largely inhospitable to human settlement](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification_maps_of_Australia#/media/File:Australia-climate-map_MJC01_1.svg), as a large swathe of the inner landmass is a desert surrounded by a thick ring of treeless grasslands. As the climate suggests, [the country as a whole does not receive much rain](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Rainfall-distribution-in-Australia-Australian-Government-Bureau-of-Meteorology-Climate_fig1_250119451) and is [already the subject of frequent and severe droughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought_in_Australia). It comes as no surprise that almost [all important settlements are concentrated on the temperate southeastern coast](https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2017/07/Population-density-australia-June-2016.jpg), with smaller settlements on the subtropical eastern and southwestern coast. Despite having a tropical climate, the northern coast is basically undeveloped. Much of this can be attributed to [the very young age of the large country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia), which was first settled in 1788 and federated into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.

As is to be expected of a young, growing, and sparsley populated country, Australia's population is [projected to continue its steady, linear rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)) from its current population of 23 million, to 33 million in 2050, to 42 million by 2100. The vast majority of this growth will be driven by immigration, as [the country's fertility rate in 2016 was 1.79](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3301.0Main%20Features42016?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=3301.0&issue=2016&num=&view=), which is below the replacement rate. [Most of the immigrants are from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Australia#Country_of_birth_of_Australian_residents) the United Kingdom (1.2 million residents as of 2016), while New Zealand, China, and India are all significant contributors (roughly 500,000 each), with a total of 28.5% of the resident population having been born overseas. With a steady flow of migrants, Australia faces relatively mild population aging, with a population pyramid that's [currently quite balanced](https://www.populationpyramid.net/australia/2015/) predicted to face [substantial flattening and lengthening up until 2100](https://www.populationpyramid.net/australia/2100/).

[Australia has vast amounts of mineral resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia), and has successfully exploited them to become one of the world's largest exporters of minerals. The country is [mostly agricultural land](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html) (53% of land), with the vast majority of it being permanent pasture (47%) and the remaining being arable (6%). Its most valuable agricultural products are [animal products (especially cattle and milk) and wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Australia#Major_agricultural_products). Rearing livestock leaves a substantial water footprint as [it takes many times more water to create a Calorie of animal product than crops and generates significant water pollution](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/5146067), which is significant in a country that is already water-stressed. Despite this, [Australia's large size and small population means it has two arable hectares per person and is a leading food-exporting nation](https://theconversation.com/how-many-people-can-australia-feed-76460) (65% of farm production exported), which means both food security and economic value are not very significant issues even in the face of a burgeoning population and potential water scarcity, as [agriculture only makes up 3.6% of GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html), while industry is 26%, and services covers the remaining 70%. 

Australia is expected to be strongly affected by climate change over this century. [An Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report from 2016](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap25_FINAL.pdf) predicts with high confidence that there will be: ""more frequent hot extremes, less frequent cold extremes""; an increase in fire weather in most of southern Australia; a range of rainfall changes, the dry end of which ""would have severe implications for agriculture, rural livelihoods, ecosystems, and urban water supply, and would increase the need for transformational adaptation""; and an increase in frequency and/or intensity of extreme climactic events in many locations. There was also a vague suggestion that ""some sectors in some locations have the potential to benefit from projected changes in climate and increasing atmospheric CO2"".

&nbsp;

**New Zealand**

New Zealand has a population of 4.5 million and is in many ways similar to Australia, but poorer (apologies to New Zealanders reading this). 

Its population is slated to [continue growing linearly until 2050](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant)), when it will begin to gradually plateau and its population pyramid will see [gradual aging through 2100](https://www.populationpyramid.net/new-zealand/2100/), signified by flattening and lengthening. Unlike Australia, [it is experiencing mass emigration to Australia](https://www.populationpyramid.net/migrants/en/new-zealand/2013/), though immigration from other countries (most notably, the United Kingdom) more than makes up for the emigrants. It has a similar GDP composition, with 4% agriculture, 26% industry, and 70% services.

[High emissions climate change projections](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/likely-impacts-of-climate-change/overview-of-likely-climate-change-impacts) for New Zealand have not shown a temperature increase as large as those projected for Australia, while rainfall will dramatically increase in frequency and intensity on South Island while slightly decreasing on North Island. Though its cities are coastal, the [18-59 cm projected rise in sea levels through 2100 has not been deemed a significant threat](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/climate-change-effects-and-impacts-assessment-guidance-manual-local-51). Owing to the country being so far south, climate change impacts are not expected to be stressful and might bring increased productivity in agriculture.

&nbsp;

**Papua New Guinea**

Papua New Guinea is a country of 7 million with an equatorial climate. Its population has been projected to continue growing linearly and it is [expected to experience a demographic windfall](https://www.populationpyramid.net/papua-new-guinea/2100/) as its currently bottom-heavy population pyramid matures over this century. As a third-world country, Papua New Guinea still relies heavily on agriculture (22% of GDP) and industry (43%). 

Like most other countries, Papua New Guinea is [expected to see an increase in temperature (2.2 - 3.4C by 2090, high emissions scenario), changing rainfall patterns, and a rise in sea levels](https://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/14_PCCSP_PNG_8pp.pdf). There will likely be a decrease in tropical cyclones, though they will be more intense, and there will be more days with extreme rainfall. Due to its low level of development, these changes, though not as extreme as other countries, are expected to deal higher damage to the economy.

&nbsp;

**Melanesia (sans Papua New Guinea), Micronesia, and Polynesia**

Without [adequate historical data](https://adaptation-undp.org/explore/melanesia), projection of [future climate changes are uncertain](https://www.adaptation-undp.org/explore/micronesia). Based on the limited data available, what can be said with some confidence is that these areas are expected to see 1.0 - 3.1C increases in temperature by the end of the century and will see mildly rising sea levels (0.19 - 0.58m). Because these island nations have economies based on agriculture, subsistence, and some industry, it is likely that they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and will see large amounts of dislocation.

#Questions

* New Zealand is currently experiencing mass emigration to Australia. With climate change due to affect Australia much harder than New Zealand, will we see a reverse in this trend in the future? 

* As a follow-up to the previous question: there are billionaires such as Peter Thiel [who see New Zealand as ""the future""](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand) and have built retreats (in a literal sense) there in an apparent attempt to safeguard themselves from civilizational collapse. Although the linked article doesn't mention climate change, given the information presented above, New Zealand does seem like a relatively-stable and isolated safe-haven, with the bonus of being picturesque. Assuming there will be an influx of ultra high net worth individuals into New Zealand, how will the country's status and relations change? Will it become some sort of ""Monaco of Oceania""?

* Papua New Guinea shares an island with Indonesia, which dwarfs it on every metric. I am not familiar with Indoesia-Papua New Guinea relations, but what are the chances that Indonesia will somehow annex a Papua New Guinea that has been weakened by climate change?

* With 28.5% of its population foreign-born, Australia is the major western nation with the highest amount of immigration. Putting aside immigrants from allied countries like New Zealand and the United Kingdom, China is the largest source of migrants. Tensions between China and the west is rising and there is strong evidence that China is seeking to exert control over Australian politics using the local diaspora. How will climate change affect this geopolitical struggle, if at all?

It is mainly based on navigable rivers along with extensive barrier islands shielding the coastline.  One thing that wasn't mentioned was the extensive presence of natural harbors on both coasts.  He even said that the US has more navigable waterways than the rest of the world combined. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1QJ3hcLwHI

Here is another one saying basically the same thing. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUsVZ-gF0GA&t=49s

However, according the the CIA world factbook the US doesn't have more than the rest of the world combined with the world having a bit under 2.3 million kilometers of navigable waterways while the US has a bit over 41,000.  China has more.  Russia also has a large network if interconnected waterways at their population centers.

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2093.html

This theory also doesn't take into consideration the massive economic power of California and Texas, both of which don't have extensive navigable waterways.  There are also strong economies in Florida, the Pacific Northwest and the Southwestern states which are mostly deserts.  According to this idea the southwest should not have such an economy.  The inland northwestern states are also growing rapidly with Boise, Idaho being one of the fastest growing areas in the US. 

The waterways only really help for products with a fairly low value for their weight like grain and gravel.  Those are not exactly the drivers of modern economies. 

What is the explanation for this?  The only explanations for the success and power of the United States that I have seen before this has been garbage like saying that Americans have some fundamental qualities that allow America to perform so well.  I think that there is nothing exceptional about people in America.

Central America and the Caribbean have been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook. The region under discussion is comprised of the following seven countries (listed by population; descending):

* Honduras

* Guatemala

* El Salvador

* Nicaragua

* Costa Rica

* Panama

* Belize

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

* Populations in the region are generally projected to increase by the end of the century, with El Salvador being the sole exception with a modest decrease projected. Honduras is projected to see a roughly 50% increase, while Guatemala, Panama, and Belize are projected to see roughly 100% increases. Nicaragua and Costa Rica are projected to see modest increases.

* With the minor exception of Costa Rica, countries in the region have population pyramids that are generally bottom-heavy, reflecting their statuses as developing nations. Despite this, El Salvador and Nicaragua seem likely to experience problems related to population aging by the end of the century based on demographic projections, while Honduras and Costa Rica seem likely to experience mild issues.

* The region is impoverished, with GDP (PPP) per capita well below the world average of $17,500, at $11,200. The average has been significantly skewed upwards by Panama, which is a regional outlier at $25,400, as the regional median is $8,200. Honduras and Nicaragua are particularly impoverished, with $5,800 and $5,900. It is notable that Guatemala has a larger percentage of its population living below the poverty line than Haiti, according to the latest available data from both countries. This is notable because Guatemala's GDP (PPP) per capita is more than four times larger than that of Haiti. However, measures of population poverty should be taken with a grain of salt due to limitations and inconsistencies. The region is likely to face problems adapting to climate change due to its vulnerability and low wealth.

* With the exception of Panama and Belize, capital cities in the region are far from coasts, and this seems true of most major population centers as well. The region's two largest countries --Honduras and Guatemala-- have populations that tend to reside in mountainous regions, which limits the impacts of sea level rise. Coasts of the hurricane-prone region are threatened by inundation by storm surges that are exacerbated by sea level rise that will likely lead to destruction of coastal resources and infrastructure. Costa Rica's city of Puntarenas, with a population of 134,000, could have 90% of its residential areas flooded during storms if the sea level rises by a meter, which is considered a conservative projection for the end of the century by some.

* The region is very rich in freshwater, as it has an average of 21,106 m3 per capita per year, while the global average is 5,900 m3. Though there is a large range of values (2,488 m3 to 34,990 m3), even the second-lowest value is substantially above the global average (Guatemala, at 6,858 m3). However, the developing status of these countries means that access to freshwater remains and will likely continue to remain a significant issue for sizeable portions of their populations due to poor or lacking infrastructure, and that aspects of climate change that affects the supply of freshwater, such as changes in precipitation patterns, increased temperature, and salination by seawater inundation, will likely have outsized impacts on the quantity and quality of accessible freshwater for many, if not most.

* Agriculture plays a large role in the economies of the region, contributing more than ten percent to five of the seven countries--including the top four countries by population. With the exception of Belize, there seems to be decent amounts of agricultural land in every country with healthily diversified uses. Most countries in the region produce 3,000 - 7,000 Calories per capita per day, with the exceptions being El Salvador and Panama, which produce less then 3,000. The generally-rainfed nature of agriculture in the region makes it more vulnerable to the instability introduced by climate change. Staple crops such as maize, rice, and beans are generally projected to see yield reductions over the century. Coffee, which is a very important commodity crop in ther region, is relatively sensitive to growing conditions and will likely see its growing zone shift significantly. Given the economic and political significance of agriculture, the relatively low food production, and the impoverishment of the region, food security is likely to be an issue.

#General Introductions

Central America and the Caribbean have been divided using regional divisions found in the CIA World Factbook.

Countries that are overseas territories of other countries (e.g. Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe) and countries that contain less than 0.5% of the region's total population have been excluded for expediency. Guyana and Suriname have been included in last week's discussion covering western and northern South America, while Belize will be included in next week's discussion covering Central America. 

The region under discussion is comprised of the following seven countries (listed by population; descending):

* Cuba

* Haiti

* Dominican Republic

* Jamaica

* Trinidad and Tobago

* The Bahamas

* Barbados

Information relevant to the discussion can be found in the Google Spreadsheet linked below. Countries have been listed in order of their population sizes. Please note that Google Translate was used to search and cite certain UNFCCC communications that were not available in English.

#Observations

*  Populations in the region are generally projected to see modest changes over the century, with some seeing decreases (Cuba, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados) and others seeing increases (Haiti, Dominican Republic, The Bahamas). Jamaica is a notable exception to this, as it is projected to see its population halve over the century, reaching 1965 levels.

* Population pyramids indicate that the region is generally developing, with many pyramids being significantly skewed towards younger age ranges. Cuba and Barbados are the exceptions, as the former has a bimodal distribution and the latter is relatively flat.

* The region is at the world average in GDP (PPP) per capita ($17,500). Trinidad and Tobago and The Bahamas are relatively wealthy, each having more than $30,000 GDP (PPP) per capita, while Jamaica has $9,200 and Haiti has a staggering $1,800, making it one of the poorest countries in the world and a major outlier among new world countries covered so far. The region is likely to face problems adapting to climate change due to its high vulnerability and relatively low wealth.

* The region is poor in freshwater, as the average per capita renewable internal freshwater is 2,221 cubic meters per year. This is less than half of the global average of 5,900 cubic meters per year. Barbados has an especially low amount of this statistic, at 282 cubic meters per year, while Cuba and Jamaica have the highest amount, at 3,332 and 3,780 cubic meters per year, respectively. It seems likely that climate change will cause the region to experience water stress, as countries generally project reductions in precipitation and increased temperatures. Sea level rise (discussed below), when combined with hurricanes, will likely cause salination of water reserves through inundation.

* Larger countries in the region contain a decent proportion of agricultural land, with a varied and balanced mix of pasture and arable land. Smaller countries generally have much less agricultural land, percentage-wise, with The Bahamas being only 1.4% agricultural land. Despite the variety, all countries in the region produce less than 3,000 Calories of food per capita per day. With the exception of Haiti, agriculture plays a relatively small role in the regions economies. Climate change is expected to negatively affect agriculture in the region, largely due to increased water stress and flooding. Because of its significant impoverishment leading to already high rates of malnutrition, climate change ""could devastate Haiti’s overall food and economic security without adoption of appropriate adaptation measures"".

* The region is comprised of many island nations with significant proportions of their populations living at or near coasts, and with coastal attractions are significant drivers of its economies. Sea level rise, combined with the high incidence of hurricanes and the low altitude of the land, can cause major changes to land use (e.g. reducing agricultural land) and salination of water reserves. There is a wide variation in projected sea level rise, with some, like Cuba, projecting a 20-35 cm rise by 2100, while others project rises of around 40-70 cm.

43,Brief History of American Intervention in Yemen,30.0,qld0zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/qld0zi/brief_history_of_american_intervention_in_yemen/,4.0,1635883866.0," **Brief History of American Intervention in Yemen**  
 **2009 - 2021**

&#x200B;

In 2009 the United States Government made a deal with President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen requesting access to conduct operations against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The same group responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole, the attempted airline bombing on [Christmas Day over Detroit in 2009](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-sentenced-life-prison-attempted-bombing-flight-253-christmas-day), but more famously known for the massacre in France in response to the [Charlie Hebdo](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/14/europe/charlie-hebdo-france-attacks/) magazine attacks. AQAP was operating out of Southern Yemen at the time. In exchange, the Obama administration would [supply Saleh with weapons, money, and intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen/yemen-president-tackles-boosting-security-with-u-s-idUSTRE60116K20100102) to help fight against the AQAP.

[After support had arrived](https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/12/07/yemens-double-game-2/), President Saleh headed North with his new weapons, planning to attack his political rivals, the Zaidi Shi’ite Houthis. There are conflicting reports that the US Government knew this was President Saleh’s plan all along. Saleh had been using the supplies provided by the US Government to fight AQAP, but he also had been using them to fight his war in the North.

Unfortunately, Saleh’s war was not going as planned. Every time he attacked the Houthis, he lost. This failed military adventure had the exact opposite effect than intended. It allowed the Houthis to garner political and military power from their quick achievements throughout the North, making America’s allies in Yemen (Saleh) weaker.

The same thing was happening with the CIA’s drone war against AQAP in the South. Every time a drone strike was carried out, the [collateral damage](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/14/hidden-toll-of-us-drone-strikes-in-yemen-nearly-a-third-of-deaths-are-civilians-not-al-qaida/) was more significant than the number of dead jihadists—a reoccurring theme with Obama’s drone campaigns throughout the Middle East. With the increasing number of innocents killed, AQAP began to increase its numbers from the survivors of the drone strikes.

With enemies increasing in the North and South, the Americans were losing ground and influence. By 2011 Yemen became a big player in the [Arab Spring](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/arab_spring/Yemen), protesting American intervention within their Government. Saleh had been funded and armed yet ultimately failed not only in his wars to the North but his promised support fighting AQAP. At this point, Yemenis did not feel represented by their Government.

During the protests of the Arab Spring, President Saleh managed to hold onto power until he was injured in a second assassination attempt. A bombing that almost took his life. The Gulf Cooperation Council decided to remove President Saleh after his failures and months of protest. [Taking Saleh’s place](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-obama-idUSTRE7AM29B20111123) would be a new democratically elected President, his Vice President, Mansour Hadi. Who just so happened to be the only candidate on the ballot.

This election of a [single candidate](https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html) upset the Yemeni people. The only support realistically garnered by Hadi was from the Muslim Brotherhood group Al-Islah. After Saleh had recovered from his wounds, he decided that he wouldn’t be replaced so easily. It turned out that Saleh himself happened to be a Zaidi Shi’ite Houthi; with a large portion of his Army, joined his former enemies to the North, and [began a new war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-push-offensive-in-aden-killing-dozens-with-artillery-fire/2015/03/31/79f53d9e-d729-11e4-bf0b-f648b95a6488_story.html) against former Vice President and now current president President Hadi.

With most of the Yemeni Army underneath Saleh’s control, he began to march south, and by the end of 2014, he had [control of the capitol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0HH2BQ20140922). The Houthis had been successful and chased Hadi all the way South to the coastal city of Aden. The Wall Street Journal was now [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-citizen-held-hostage-in-yemen-released-by-houthi-rebels-1433178829) that the Obama administration had no problem with the Houthis and that if they wanted to help us fight AQAP, that was fine with them. The Obama administration started to provide the Houthis with intelligence to use against AQAP in January of 2015. Within two months, the Obama administration stabbed the Houthis in the back and decided to take the [Saudis and AQAP’s](https://www.fcnl.org/sites/default/files/documents/yemen_war_aiding_aqap_and_iran.pdf) side against the Houthis in operation Decisive Storm. 

The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-us.html) how the United States had shifted support from the Shi’ite Houthis to the Sunni Saudis and AQAP—giving the green light to the Saudis and providing intelligence, funding, and bombs. This war was launched without knowing what victory could look like in this region, and [US generals reported](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/17/us-generals-think-saudi-strikes-in-yemen-a-bad-idea.html) intervention ‘a bad idea’.

This new policy and backing of Saudi intervention in Yemen began a five-year-long siege on the people of Yemen. The US has provided [jets](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/middleeast/yemen-unrest/) and [naval support](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/20/politics/iran-united-states-warships-monitoring/), along with intelligence to the Saudis. Along with increased [sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/yemen.pdf) and the blocking of ports within the Gulf of Aden. Saudi Air Force has reportedly targeted [hospitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-hospital-bombing.html), water purifications plants, food sources, and sewage centers. These targeted airstrikes are the leading cause of [famine](https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/yemen-emergency) and a massive [outbreak of cholera](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7411249/) within the country. According to humanitarian aid workers, over [80,000 children have died](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983) from malnutrition and cholera, a disease easily treated with clean drinking water and essential antibiotics.

By 2017 Abdullah Saleh no longer had the support of the US or Saudi forces. He remained in command of the Houthi forces, who made up the majority of the Yemen military in the country. US foreign policy now backing the Saudi and AQAP, Saleh was becoming desperate. He had tried to make a secret deal with the Saudis by turning on his Houthi forces, and he was quickly [killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/former-yemen-president-saleh-killed-in-fresh-fighting) by his men just outside the countries capital days later.

Not much changed during the Trump administration. [The Saudis were unhappy about the JCPOA](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/10/11/why-the-saudis-would-cheer-the-de-certification-of-the-iran-deal/) deal made only a few years earlier, and Trump had decided to appease the Saudis even further by breaking the agreement with Iran. Not only was the JCPOA dead in the water but, the administration also continued Naval and Air support for the Saudi military. A deal was signed at the end of the Trump presidency to end the Saudi and AQAP support in Yemen. However, Pompeo did add the Houthis to the international terrorist list a week before leaving office. An important note is that they hadn’t been on this list the entire time during these interventions.

Biden, to his credit, has been trying to focus on ending all military support within this part of the Middle East. Next would be to begin flooding Yemen with as much humanitarian aid and supplies as possible. The unintended consequences of our foreign policy have led to thousands and possibly millions dead within the poorest country of the Middle East.

49,How to defeat ISIS and Islamic Extremists in general - bombing won't do it,20.0,2j1384,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/2j1384/how_to_defeat_isis_and_islamic_extremists_in/,46.0,1413125711.0,"http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/how-to-defeat-isis-and-islamic.html

Stop Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait from funding them. They are their major donors.

Ban all Wahhabi schools in America and ask Europe to do the same. Stop Saudi Arabia funding extremist Madrassas in Pakistan. This will reduce future recruits for Islamic Extremists - be they ISIS or some other follow on group.

Even if you defeated ISIS militarily, some other Islamic Extremist group would spring up in it's place.
If you want to defeat ISIS, you should read how the SAS defeated Islamic Terrorists in Oman in the 1950's.

1. You have to take the local support base away. A guerrilla army cannot operate without local support.

2. You have to take their source of arms and funding away. See above that means getting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop supporting them.

3. You have to offer a better alternative than the one ISIS offers. That means as a first step to stop bombing people. Bombing ISIS is bound to kill innocent civilians as ""collateral damage"" which will just make things worse. It also means stopping the bombing of Pakistan and Yemen. The SAS in Oman took great pains to NOT to kill civilians. America kills far too many of them - it's a large part of the reason for ordinary people's support for ISIS.

4. You have to stop Turkey giving support to Islamic Extremist groups across the Northern border of Syria.

5. You have to stop Israel giving support to Al-Nusra (an affiliate of Al-Qaeda) across the Southern border of Syria.

6. Iraq
There will never be a military solution to ISIS, unless there is an acceptable political solution to Sunni's in Iraq. Iraq is an artificial country with Kurds in the North East, Sunni's in the middle and Shia's in the South. The sectarian hatred within Iraq is now so great after a decade and more of war, hostility, death, violence and poverty, that an inclusive political settlement is probably no longer possible. There will have to be a 3 State solution to Iraq to defeat ISIS. With the Kurds, the Sunni's and the Shia's all having their own country. For now ISIS should be contained in the Sunni dominated region that they now control in Iraq. They should be contained by the Kurds in the North West (as is already happening) and by the Shia militias, Iran and the Baghdad government in the South. A US bombing campaign will only strengthen ISIS support and serve to exacerbate the current crisis. Given time ISIS provincial government of the region will collapse from their lack of military progress, the lack of a unifying enemy to recruit further fighters, the difficulties of governing a large mostly poor, disparate group of people with numerous different tribal loyalties. Basic economics and human nature should be allowed to kill off ISIS. US bombs and bullets will have the opposite effect - as it has for the last 12 years.

7. Let Assad defeat ISIS and other Islamic Extremists in Syria.
Assad has the support base among the population in Syria that will allow ISIS to be defeated there, providing there is no interference or help to ISIS and other Islamic Extremist groups from neighboring countries (Turkey, Israel and Jordan - as there currently has. As well as stopping the money and arms supplied by the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait). The vast majority of Syrians are moderate Muslims and the last thing they want to see is Islamic Extremist Wahhabis and Salafis take over their country.

8. Withdraw American support for Israel.
Israeli war crimes such as the indiscriminate murdering of civilians in Gaza we have just witnessed and the constant Ethnic Cleansing and illegal settlement building in the West Bank is the other major source of recruitment for Islamic Extremists like ISIS and Al-Nusra.

9. Stop ISIS from selling their oil

A far simpler, less costly and much more effective measure than bombing people, would be to take steps to severely reduce the $2m+ a day of funding that ISIS is currently getting by selling it's oil production. But Congress are not voting on any measures like that.
ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day which it is selling at between $25 and $60 a barrel on the black market.
The crude is being transported in oil tanker trucks, mostly into Southern Turkey.
Presumably this is currently being done with the connivance (or even active collaboration) of the Turkish government.

We know that Kurdish oil is being loaded onto oil tankers at Ceyhan in Turkey from other reports.

What is congress and the media doing to investigate and prevent ISIS from selling their reported $2m+ a day of oil production?

Whoever is helping ISIS sell their oil, transporting it or buying it, is providing direct and material support for a designated terrorist organization.

A policing action in Southern Turkey to stop oil, weapons and fighters crossing the border with Syria, would be an effective counter measure to ISIS's current strength.

There are ongoing battles between the Kurds and ISIS to control the large oil refinery at Baiji and oil fields near the Kurdish border
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-iraq-crisis-oil-idUSKBN0GZ2BK20140904

Taking control of an industrial oil refinery would be a key strategic win for ISIS and should be prevented. If ISIS does manage to gain control of it, it should simply be blown up with a few bombs, preferably after warning the local population that bombs are about to be dropped to avoid civilian casualties. The Iraqi air force NOT the US should do this (there will be less blowback from an attack by Baghdad).

N.B. There are now reports of Obama bombing ""mobile"" small oil refineries that are capable of refining around 500 barrels of oil a day. This is a drop in the bucket - ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day and Obama is not hitting any of the oil fields. Most of ISIS's crude oil is being sold in Southern Turkey - see above. 

These are the ISIS refineries we're bombing. A drop in the bucket of ISIS oil revenues - around 1% http://mktplc.org/1wPv2tG

Why Obama's current strategy simply will not work and why he is lying to you

Both the FBI and CIA are against Obama's proposals to tackle ISIS because they won't work. Congress approved them anyway http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/httpclerk.html 

The Generals don't think that Obama's tactics are going to work either. They are now openly talking up the probability of a war against ISIS lasting another 20 years and so are Dem leaders:-

50,China Can’t Always Get What it Wants in Thailand (Asian Times),24.0,9fo96n,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9fo96n/china_cant_always_get_what_it_wants_in_thailand/,5.0,1536891902.0,"Yesterday, the Asian Times published an article titled [""China can't always get what it wants in Thailand""](http://www.atimes.com/article/china-cant-always-get-what-it-wants-in-thailand/).  The last time an article was posted about Thailand was during the King's cremation, over a year ago.  I am going to provide a summary and some context..  Even though Thailand is the 2nd largest economy in SEA, it doesn't get as much coverage as Myanmar, even though I think its the most vital country in Mainland Southeast Asia for China and the US.

&nbsp;

**SUMMARY**

&nbsp;

The article explains the how the Thai Military Junta has engaged with China since 2014. Initially the ever closer relations was motivated by the US demands that democracy be restored in Thailand, but since Trump has come to power,  the Thais have begun to show their characteristic restraint, independence and caution when it comes to dealing with larger powers. 

&nbsp;

The author begins the piece by describing an incident with Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli during the cremation ceremony of King Bhumibol Adulyadej last year.  According to the article he raise 

&nbsp;

> Undiplomatic fuss when told new King Maha Vajiralongkorn was unavailable for a private audience because of his central role in the sacred ceremony.The Chinese official aired further displeasure when told neither was Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-ocha available for a one-on-one meeting during the elaborate event, attended by global dignitaries to pay condolences and last respects to a monarch many Thais viewed as semi-divine.Zhang was only placated after Mandarin-speaking Princess Sirindhorn, Bhumibol’s daughter, agreed to interpret part of the ceremony from his diplomatic viewing box, though the palace had earlier forbade simultaneous translation of the chants in line with historic protocol, according to Thai officials familiar with the events who requested anonymity.

&nbsp;

According to the article, the intention of the visit was also to extend an invitation to Vajiralongkorn, the than Crown Prince, to visit China. 

&nbsp;

While the consensus view is that China has made both strategic, military and diplomatic gains. the Thai Junta has ""have subtly withheld from Beijing, often in the name of upholding sovereignty and independence.""  > The author list several issues

&nbsp;

1.The US$5 Billion 873 KM Railway Line that will link Kunming in China via Laos to Thailand's east coast ports.  The project has suffered delays with the completion date pushed back from 2018 to 2023, and most likely won't be completed at that date, due to Thai insistence to use Thai workers and firms on the construction of the line. Only recently allowed some Chinese engineers to come and help with design. Furthermore, the Thais have preferred to put their attention on rail inks around Metro Bangkok. This link is **critical for China** because without this link the US$6.00 Billion China financed railway in Lao is useless. Since Construction has in December 2017.

&nbsp;

>Eight months later, however, the project has still made little building progress beyond a two kilometer track stretch reaching to the outskirts of Bangkok, analysts monitoring the construction say..

&nbsp;

2.Thailand purchases 3 Sub from China, at the initial displeasure of the US. The US has complain that it won't use the Thai naval base in the Gulf of Thailand,if the Satthip naval base, if the Chinese built subs are based there, fearing Chinese spies. One official said they might base the sub in the less strategic Andaman coast.

&nbsp;

3.While Prayut  has embraced Chinese business delegations, there has been little Chinese investment in Thailand. However, there is one sector that the Chinese have shown interest, is the surge in the number of Chinese tourist to Thailand. Rising from 1 Million per year in 2014, to 13 Million in 2018, 1/3 of all foreign tourist in Thailand, or making up 4% of Thai GDP  When there was the incident where the Thai Defense Minister criticized Chinese tour operators when a boat sunk in Thailand killing 47 Chinese tourist,  China didn't make a big fuss, as it sometimes does with tourist, because of strategic ambitions such as the Kra canal to by pass the Malacca Strait.

&nbsp;

**COMMENTARY**

&nbsp;

I am not sure whether the incident with the Vice Premier and the Crown Prince is true, because I haven't found any reports of such an incident, it could be in the Thai language website in the form of rumors as with a lot of press regarding the Royal family in Thailand. That being said, China has a habit of showing who is boss during funerals. If China felt the relations with Thailand was important, why did they only send a Vice Premier instead of the Premier (there are 4 VIce Premiers). The US sent Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis.   While in protocol a Vice Premier is higher than a Defense Secretary, but since the Thai rulers are a military Junta and US has extensive military links with the Thais, it makes show how important the relationship is to the US. Its like with the funeral of Lee Kuan Yew, they sent the Vice President, Li Yuanchao. The Americans sent Bill Clinton.   Both King Bhumipol and Lee Kuan Yew loomed large of their countries and Asia for over 1/2 century, in the case of Bhumipol even before the creation of the PRC.  The Thais are one of the few remaining monarchies in Asia are sticklers for diplomatic protocol and ceremony.  If you look at the order in which the Thais listed the foreign dignities who attended the Royal Cremation last year, heads of state and [monarchs who attended were listed first](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30330011). In Singapore they just listed in [alphabetical order for Lee Kuan Yew funeral](http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/list-foreign-dignitaries-close-friends-attending-mr-lee-kuan-yews-funeral). For Thailand Lesotho was listed first of the foreign dignitaries, because both the King and Queen attended the ceremony.  If only the monarch himself/herself attended he/she was listed after monarch / head of state who was accompanied by his/her spouse. 

&nbsp;

I wouldn't be surprised if the incident with the Vice Premier actually did happen. Chinese diplomats have a habit of putting their foot in their mouth [like in Namibia](https://www.namibian.com.na/70694/read/Geingob-tells-Chinese-ambassador-We-are-not-puppets). The American have a much better understanding of the cult of personality around the Thai Kings, because the CIA helped create it. they financed Bumipols rural development projects, his propaganda machine during the Cold War as a way of boasting the monarchy to curb the spread of Communism among the rural population.

&nbsp;

As regard to the railway. Building any railway / road project in Southeast Asia particularly in high density areas is always going to take a long time, regardless whether a country is a democracy or dictatorship, and the main reason is land acquisition. In the Bandung - Jakarta high speed rail link financed by China, they only bought 40% of the land after 4 years. Its most likely cheaper and faster to use Chinese workers, given Thailand itself has labor shortages. Unlike in other countries in SEA with relatively high unemployment rates like Indonesia or cultural suspicion of China like Vietnam, Thais doesn't have any of those factors. So why are the Thais so insistent that they do the construction themselves? Its sensitivity of building rail links from China into Mainland Southeast Asia. For centuries Mainland SEA has been cut off and protected from immigration and incursions from China because of climate and terrain. The only time they did invade a country in Mainland SEA outside of Vietnam was the disastrous Sino-Burmese War of 1765-69. The Thai Junta want to make sure they are the ones determining the route, the switches and signaling. 

&nbsp;

As for the submarines. The Thai Navy has been lobbying to get submarines for years. However, Thai military has a history of graft and questionable purchases, particularly the Thai Navy.  The Thai Navy is the only country in SEA to have an aircraft carrier that now spends most of its time anchored   

&nbsp;

Like with the railway, the submarines  contracts and acquisition have been facing delays [and little progress](https://thediplomat.com/2018/09/where-is-the-new-china-thailand-submarine-deal-headed/), even though the deal was signed in 2015. If the Thais were serious about the subs, it usually takes about 4-5 years from signing of the contract to delivery of the first sub, based on experiences of Malaysia with their sub purchases from France it took five years from the signing of the contract to delivery, and it includes training, because like Thailand, the Malaysian had never operated submarines before..

&nbsp;

Thailand doesn't get a lot of press lately, and as a result people overlook its importance.  If China could get access to Thailand, it wouldn't have to butter up to Cambodia and Myanmar. Chinese strategic objectives could be met through Thailand alone.  For China its not going to be easy to influence a country like Thailand for the following reasons:

&nbsp;

1.Thailand has been under Western-Japanese influence since late 19th century. because it was never colonized formally by the West or Japan, Thais don't have the antipathy they have toward the Japanese or Westerners.  Thailand was an ally of Japan during the War, Japan is the largest foreign investor in Thailand, and has been like this for 50 years.

&nbsp;

2.The Thai political system is fractured. You have the military, the King-Palace and civilian politicians. Because of the presence of the King, the last time Thailand had a strong military dictator was in the 1930s, since the 1950s the Thai King and military have symbiotic relationship. There are different centers of power. Both the Thai military s close ties with the US military, and the Thai King was educated in British public (ie private) schools and graduated from the  Royal Military College in Australia. China would have an easier time if Thailand was a civilian democracy.
 
&nbsp;

3.The difficulty with trying to influence a country like Thailand is its much more costly than Myanmar or Cambodia. its economy is 7 times larger than Myanmar's,  The Thai economy is a full employment, they draw in workers from poorer neighbors. 

&nbsp;

4..Even though Thailand has the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of greater China, at 9 Million, Thai Chinese  are very assimilated largely due to policies adopted by the Thai government in the 1940-50s, when they closed Chinese medium schools  and ""forced"" ethnic Chinese to take up Thai names. That was after a series of anti-Chinese riots in Thailand in the 1930-40s.

&nbsp;

>In a series of presentations, conferences, and phone calls over the last year the discussion of Chinese intelligence and information operations invariably raises the question: “How do the Chinese compare to the Russians?

&nbsp;

The article was the first installment of the five part series titled ""Ministry of Truth"" which focused on China's state sponsored influence operations. Here are the other articles in the series 

2. [China’s ‘Three Warfares’ in Perspective.](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/chinas-three-warfares-perspective/)

5. [What We Talk About When We Talk About Chinese Communist Party Interference in the Public Square.](https://warontherocks.com/2018/03/talk-talk-chinese-communist-party-interference-public-square/)

&nbsp;

[Peter Matthis is a former analyst for the CIA, and now works as a fellow for Jamestown Foundation] (https://www.petermattis.com/).

&nbsp;

The reason why I decided to post his here, was three weeks I posted an article from the Economist titled [China is misreading Western populism](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9qao19/china_is_misreading_western_populism/).  My opinion is that a lot of problems China has with understanding Western populism has to do with how they conduct influencing operations, which forms a structural barrier to understanding Western populism, particularly the US.  There are other articles that provide a more in depth overview how China conducts its influencing operations [SinoInsider](https://sinoinsider.com/), but they don't do a nearly a good job as Peter Matthis in framing how China conducts its influencing operations.  He has elaborated  his comparisons of Russian and Chinese operations in a chapter of a book of the Axis of Authoritarianism [Russian and Chinese Political Interference Activities and Influence Operations](https://www.nbr.org/publication/axis-of-authoritarians-implications-of-china-russia-cooperation/) which was published a month ago.

&nbsp;

Before beginning, there are two things I like to point out.  First, its provides a framework to understanding Chinese influencing operations and how the PRC conducts its foreign affairs.  The actual contemporary examples appear in the subsequent articles. 

&nbsp;

NOTE: I know this will be a unpopular topic, because there is a bias toward great man diplomacy in /r/geopolitics (I repeat this sub infamous header). First, it involves understanding what diplomats and other minor state actors.  Their actions tells a lot more about a country's policy toward another country than someone sitting in Moscow or Beijing writing a policy paper.. More important, it tells more about a country's world view than strategy. Why operations are like habits, it takes a long time to change. ASsthe article will show, the methods China and Russia use haven't change much since the 1930s.  

&nbsp;

**PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE, AND IF YOU HAVE THE TIME ALL 3 OTHER ARTICLES ABOUT CHINA. A SUMMARY IS JUST A SUMMARY**

&nbsp;

**SUMMARY**

&nbsp;

The article start off by listing recent incidents of suspected Russian and Chinese influencing operations in the West. For Russia, they list Russian involvement in the US elections in 2016, and Chinese influence operations in Western allies like Australia and New Zealand.  The difference between Russian and Chinese influencing operations can be neatly summarized by this sentence  

>I have attempted to describe the differences with three distinctions between Russian and Chinese influence operations: set-piece operations vs. playing the man; service-led operations vs. service-facilitated operations; and agents of influence vs. influenced agents. 

How the author cautions this aren't perfect distinctions, and both system use a variety of methods, and China is using some methods from the Russian in relation to [Taiwan](https://jamestown.org/program/counterintelligence-remains-weakness-in-taiwans-defense/).

&nbsp;

Both Moscow and Beijing approach influencing operations as a normal way of doing business. In contrast, the US approach toward covert actions as usually distinct from routine business of foreign relations **NOTE: This is not my word, I am just summarizing what he is saying**.  I think the distinction between diplomacy and covert action even in the US is blurrier than the author admits.  

&nbsp;

**Set-Piece Operations vs. Playing the Man**

&nbsp;

The Russians are experts at set piece operations

>These have ranged from forged or otherwise manipulated documents being used to discredit a target to planting rumors that the United States unleashed the AIDS virus as a biological weapons program. The objective may be as specific as an individual or as broad as poisoning the environment.

These methods were developed in the Soviet Ministry of Defense. It developed out of research into  psychology and operations research. By mapping how decisions were made, the Russians could design operations to influence the decisions.

&nbsp;

The Chinese focus on individuals rather than effects (or outcomes).Its person to person relationships that carry the weight in China's information operations. Many of the first generation diplomats and negotiators operate as intelligence officers. The history of the CCP can illustrate how the party manipulates an adversary, with the most notable example was the Xian incident.

>In December 1936, as the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-sheik closed around the CCP, two of Chiang’s generals, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, kidnapped him and forced him to agree to the second CCP-Kuomintang united front to fight the Japanese. The public story for many years was that Zhang and Yang were motivated by patriotism and a desire to unite the Chinese people against the foreign threat. Earlier that year, the CCP had dispatched future premier Zhou Enlai and espionage specialist Li Kenong to open a channel and negotiate with Zhang, whose forces posed a more immediate danger and was the senior of the two. Thanks to a long-time friend and former aide of Yang, Nan Hanchen, Zhou and Li possessed inside information on both generals’ motivations that helped them exert pressure internally without revealing the CCP’s hand. As a result of these efforts, Zhang and Yang slowly turned against Chiang as the year went on. Then, in December, without communist prompting or knowledge, they decided to kidnap him to a force a CCP-Kuomintang truce that Zhou then negotiated. The lesson? By building the relationships, unexpected opportunities will arise.

&nbsp;

**Service-Led Operations vs. Service-Facilitated Operations**

&nbsp;

In Russia, the intelligence operations take a leading role.  While in China, intelligence agencies take a supporting role. The KGB played the lead role in managing Moscow’s program to influence foreign governments, societies, and events. Even directed the some of the resource of the International Department and International Information Department which was responsible for the overt side.

&nbsp;

The Chinese intelligence services, however, seem to play a secondary role in influencing external actors and events. The principle organizations — the Liaison Department of the PLA’s Political Work Department and the United Front Work Department — report to the Politburo through a completely separate chain of command that deals mostly with party affairs.  The services and influence organizations — particularly the Liaison Department and the United Front Work Department — do play a role in setting up and facilitating the activities of a multitude of friendship and cultural associations.  The Chinese participants in exchanges organized in these groups are rarely intelligence officers themselves, but rather party elite who understand the party’s international objectives and have been trained in managing foreigners.

&nbsp;

**Agents of Influence vs. Influenced Agents**

&nbsp;

Russia relies heavily on intelligence officers, their ability to pound the pavement and socialize, and their recruited agents. The Russian services appear perfectly willing to recruit agents simply for active measures, and they also cultivate collaborators who may not understand with whom they dealing or why.  They often putting out false information.   The first was simply to hire or recruit individuals to produce manipulative cultural products to discredit political figures and hostile institutions. The second was ever-more sophisticated ways of producing doctored or forged documents that could then be passed discretely to newspapers or researchers.

&nbsp;

The CCP approach generally appears much softer, perhaps because the formal intelligence organizations play a less visible role. He list individuals as Sheri Yan (now jailed for bribery) and Chau Chok-wing of Australia or Chinese-American Katrina Leung.  The kind of elite relationship-building that these individuals demonstrate and seem to be the hallmarks of Chinese influence are what make flirtations with ethics violations difficult to dismiss out of hand. 

&nbsp;

Secondly,  the author describes how Mao Zedong tried to influence foreign contacts from the beginning.  A good example is Edgar Snow and the Red Star over China/  They also influenced US officials who erred in exaggerating the fault and corruption of the KMT and Chiang Kai-sheik. 

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

&nbsp;

The way to describe to describe the difference is  Chinese are human- or relationship-centric while the Russians are operation- or effects-centric.

&nbsp;

**ANALYSIS AND OPINION**

&nbsp;

Here I am going broader analysis of why Russian and particularly China use the methods they use.   Much of it is rooted in the domestic situation and history, but more importantly how they conduct foreign relations in general. What is interesting is often people say Asians look at context, and Europeans focus on teh individual, but with regards to Chinese/Russian foreign policy operations its the reverse.

&nbsp;

**HISTORY**

&nbsp;

The difference between the Russians and the Chinese, the Russians had been much more influenced by outside influences than the Chinese, whether Mongol or European. For centuries, Russian noble families would often speak German/French, or in the case of the last Tsar, English.  When the Manchus invaded China, it was the Manchus that integrated into the Chinese system, in fact they were already acculturated to Chinese customs and norms, even before they captured Beijing in 1644. The Chinese never been culturally ""conquered"" the way the Russians had. The Chinese wouldn't even think of trying what the Russians did in the West even with similar societies like Japan/South Korea.  Even if they, didn't they wouldn't do a good job. For centuries, China was the owner of the candy store, they rarely looked out into the street. For centuries, the Russians were the poor street urchins looking into the European candy store, 

&nbsp;

If you asked most Chinese people about the Meiji Restoration, they wouldn't be able to name any of the 3 Nobles of the Restoration. In large part it has to do with the way Chinese history is taught, too much time is spent studying Ancient Chinese history like most Westerners were taught Greco-Roman history 100 years ago,   Most Russians would be much more familiar with the French Revolution, than the Chinese are with the Meiji Restoration..  The Meiji Restoration impact on China was greater than the French Revolution had on Russia.  In both cases it resulted in eventual war with France in the case of Russia, war with Japan in China's case. The French invasion of Russia happened 23 years after the Revolution, the first Sino Japanese War happened 26 years after the Meiji Restoration. To most people it would seem the gap between the French Revolution and Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 is much smaller than the beginning of the Meiji Restoration and the First Sino-Japanese War, but its only 3 years difference

&nbsp;

**RUSSIA  IS MORE VULNERABLE THAN CHINA**

&nbsp;

First Russia is more vulnerable than China both domestically and from a geopolitical sense.  This vulnerability has existed since 1800s, and didn't cease even during the USSR  Ethnic Russians made up 80% of Russia's population, and most of the other ethnic groups are Muslim majority ethnic groups.  The main threat to Putin is the enlargement of the EU to Ukraine.  Russian commentators like to point to enlargement of NATO that often accompanies it.  Even being a member of NATO doesn't change a regime, look at Turkey..  Just like in Soviet times, there isn't a ""hard border"" between  Baltic states and Poland during Soviet times, and especially now between Ukraine and Poland, and Ukraine and Russia. Even Brexit directly decreases the chance of Ukraine joining the EU, because it gives Poles less incentive to stay.  One of the biggest benefits the Poles got from being a member of the EU, was access to British labor markets (https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-37792967/brexit-the-poles-heading-for-the-exit-after-referendum).To do the type of operations the Russians do in the Europe, you have to have the interest, and the knowledge, which the Russians possess.

&nbsp;

China does face the same vulnerability, because its a more closed society than Russia is and it is more separated and not as connected with its neighbors Japan and South Korea, as the Russians are with Europe. The average Chinese person knows more about the West than he/she does about Japan/South Korea. The economic development are still much higher than China, and the political development over the last 100 years very different... As for Taiwan and Hong Kong, their politics is dominated by identity politics, which is relevant to the situation in mainland. Ukraine joining the EU is relevant and connects with most Russians, because it tugs at fundamental question of Russian identity to what extent should Russia partake in the European project.

&nbsp;

**ASIAN AND EUROPEAN GEOPOLITICS: CHANGE AND CONTINUITY**

Many Chinese and Russians embrace the notion of a Eurasia, that if the US retreat everything will go back to where it was in 1700, 1800 or 1900.  Setting aside the EU, in many ways the geopolitical map of Europe hasn't change.  Setting aside the EU, you still have Britain, Spain, France, Prussia (Germany) and Russia. Russia is still large, backward and poor.. Britain is still struggling with the question of her engagement with Europe in 1800 as she is today.  European geopolitics is like a football game where everyone has been playing each other for generations.The Russian method of using set piece to score goals in such an environment is perfect, because you have a good idea of how the populace of such countries will react  

&nbsp;

First even in East Asia are more disparate than Europe   Interaction between states is limited  Over the last 1000 years, the only three countries China interacted regularly was Vietnam, Mongolia and Korea.  Even contact with the Japanese was limited. China also has to deal with countries she had little contact with and very different from their precolonial manifestations, like the Indians and the Javanese (Indonesians).  Some countries like Singapore and Philippines are new. The relative demography of China/India vs Southeast Asia are very different than they were 200 years ago. In 1800, China had a population of 500 Million.  Java only had a population of 4 Million, if you add the rest of Indonesia its 5-6 Million (Labour Relations in Java 1650, 1800, 1900 Ulbe Bosma, IISH).  And they weren't united into one nation state. Now its 267 Million to China's 1.35 Billion.

**CONCLUSION**

I could write a lot more, but I decided to keep this short. I could go into other aspects why Russia / China choose their respective approaches.

52,[x-post from r/foreignpolicy] Does the CIA oppose the US lifting its embargo against Cuba?,17.0,3oab4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3oab4e/xpost_from_rforeignpolicy_does_the_cia_oppose_the/,8.0,1444528355.0,"There was an episode of The West Wing in Season 6 (2004/2005) where Leo McGarry secretly visited Cuba to investigate opening ties with Cuba. Later, the episode discussed how the CIA would never let this happen (or at least never WANT it to happen). It got me curious -- is there any truth to this in the present?

In researching the US-Cuba situation, I read that with all the Cuba refugees/immigrants who had fled their ""oppressive dictator"" living in Miami, and Florida being so important for electoral votes, U.S. presidents basically became forced to be anti-Cuba. So, clearly, there's a lot more going on than just ""Stop the Commies!""

Maybe one of the reasons the CIA would be opposed is due to Cuban spies arrested on US soil, like Ana Montes (senior analyst at the DIA, arrested 2001) and Kendall Myers (US State Department official, arrested 2009)?

The world is increasingly shaping up into 3 major economic power blocs.

The US
Major allies - UK, Israel

The EU

China, Russia
Allies - India, Brazil, South Africa, South America (excluding Columbia), most of SE Asia, most of Africa.

The US and the EU are rapidly declining in relative power, while China, SE Asia and the BRICs are rapidly growing.
This process will continue over the next 20+ years.
The leaders of the US and the EU have accelerated this process over the last 15 years and there are no signs of this slowing down, let alone changing.

Chart of Real projected GDP 2000 to 2030 http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/files/2011/04/image073-1-1.png

These estimates were produced in 2009 and dramatically under estimate the rate of decline of both the US and EU.
The EU currently has the worst economic policies in the entire world, closely followed by America.
America's share of global GDP was already down to 21.5% at the end of 2011. 

The fault lines of which of the smaller countries are allied with which major power bloc (and how strongly they are allied) will change gradually over time.  

This process will be much like the shifting of the tectonic plates in the Earth's crust, pressure will build up and then there will be a noticeable shift causing an earthquake. There will be small earthquakes and there will be some big ones. 

There has just been a minor earthquake in Ukraine. 
The nett result of the US engineered coup in Ukraine has been to drive Russia and China closer together faster and hasten the end of American hegemony.

Much larger earthquakes that will occur in the fairly near future are :- 

The bursting of China's current massive debt bubble 

The bursting of the West's massive financial asset and debt bubble (the largest the world has ever seen by far and already 20 times larger than the one in 2007). 

The alignment of OPEC countries
OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is currently aligned with the US but this will shift over time with the changing customer base for energy. 
The US is already energy neutral and is set to become a significant nett exporter with natural gas and fracking. 
The growth area for nett energy usage is China and SE Asia and countries within OPEC will gradually align themselves more with China.
The EU will become less important as an energy importer, due both to it's relative economic decline and to the exploitation of it's own large natural gas reserves from Fracking. 
There will be increasing tensions between the countries that make up OPEC as different countries move toward China at different rates. 
We have already seen an argument develop between Saudi Arabia and Qatar as competition within OPEC for energy export markets hots up. Previously Saudi Arabia and Qatar were 100% allied in their quest for regime change in Syria.

The alignment of Japan, Australia, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand
Pressure will build on these countries as their export markets shift from the US and/or the EU towards China and the rest of SE Asia.

Germany 
Germany is the lynchpin of the EU and is the only solvent country within the Eurozone (apart from tiny Finland). 
Europe will remain a major power bloc, with or without the EU. 
Germany's export driven economy has enjoyed an boom over the last decade because it's currency has been artificially devalued via the Euro and the Eurozone. 
Unlike the rest of the EU, Germany has low unemployment at 5% - the EU average is 12%. 
Germany is now negotiating it's own trade deals with China (which are in principle against the terms of the EU). 
Germany cannot look to the rest of the EU to increase it's exports, the rest of the EU is in dire economic trouble - it must look to growth areas and the only significant growth area is China and SE Asia. 
The German people are gradually rebelling against the prospect of Germany trying to bail out the rest of the Eurozone. (This is an impractical task, given that the rest of the Eurozone is 3 times larger than Germany and Germany struggled with integrating East Germany during the global economic boom of the 1990's and East Germany was only 10% of the size of West Germany.) 
Germany has asked for it's large gold reserves back from storage in the US and France. 
Merkel has been the most conciliatory (in the West) towards Russia over Ukraine. Germany is dependent on Russian energy supplies and there are no obvious alternatives. 

Africa 
Obama moved US troops into 30 more African countries in 2013. 
The US now has a military presence in 49 out of 54 African countries. 
China has signed natural resource deals with over half of Africa over the last 5 years. 

Conditions are now ripe for conflicts over Africa's natural resources to hot up - just as there was in the 20 years prior to WW1 between the major European powers. The main difference being that China is offering economic incentives to persuade African countries to their side, while the US is still using coercion, coups, bullets and bombs.

Military Power 
The US has seen the growing threat to it's hegemony from China. 
The Pentagon already has plans in place to surround China with military bases and fleets of stealth planes. The effectiveness of this strategy is extremely doubtful and it is extremely expensive, thus weakening the US even more economically. 
China meanwhile has already seen how easy it is for the Americans to be thwarted by guerrilla warfare in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. China will be seeking to embroil the US in a series of relatively small regional conflicts and will be seeking at all costs to avoid a direct military confrontation for as long as possible.
Given the very weak caliber of America's current leaders they are likely to continue playing straight into China's (and Russia's) hands for the foreseeable future, but a major confrontation will come about somewhere down the line.
The US government will not give up global hegemony without fighting for it, even if it is a lost cause. 
The coming conflict may be a hot or a cold war. 

The US Dollar as Global Reserve Currency
The US dollar will be replaced as the Global Reserve Currency at some point in the medium term. 
A loss of confidence in the dollar (and economic carnage in the US) will follow the bursting of the current massive financial asset bubble which has been engineered by the Federal Reserve private bank. 
The dollar will be replaced by a basket of currencies including Chinese Yuan and probably including Special Drawing Rights. 
China and Russia have already initiated numerous actions over the last 3 years to bring this about. 
http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/the-greatest-threat-to-us-national.html 

The latest of these are Chinese Renmimbi trading hubs in both London and Frankfurt announced late last week. Presumably the Chinese and Russians are accelerating their existing plans in response to the US engineered Coup D'Etat in Ukraine. 

US Politics 
The easiest and most effective way for the Chinese and Russians to strengthen their positions will be to bribe US politicians to adopt the policies they want the US to pursue, via dark money and front organizations. 
If they can continue to use this angle it will be far, far cheaper than conducting an arms race or fighting a war.
Other countries have already used this method to bribe US politicians to achieve their aims.
Citizens United and recent Supreme Court rulings have made this much easier to do.

The United States political system is currently experiencing a perfect storm of moneyed-interest corruption: wealthy groups and individuals are being allowed to donate virtually unlimited amounts of money to political candidates/groups while retaining anonymity from both the public and government watchdogs. This has been made possible by a loophole in the tax laws surrounding the 501(c)(4) status and a legion of faux-nonprofits have sprung up to launder the money of the elite, for use in the auction of US “democracy.”
In many ways, the United States has devolved into a plutocracy, with a powerful elite acting as the gatekeepers who decide which politicians are considered by the public. Because these elite interests give money to both sides of the mainstream political debate, they have bought influence over almost every politician in Federal office today.

America has already wasted over $6tn in fighting two utterly pointless and counter productive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and got nothing. American politicians are very easy to tempt into regional wars.
$6tn is equivalent to $60,000 for every American household or to put it another way, every American household is $60,000 poorer because of the counter productive war policies of their own government.

Time is on the side of the Chinese and Russians.
America is growing much weaker, due it's current economic policies which are wiping out it's middle class.
China and the BRICs are getting stronger.

See this for how this plays out over the next 20 to 50 years:

Some previous examples of Foreign Powers bribing US politicians :-

Some of the billions of US taxpayer dollars given to Israel every year in ""foreign aid"" is used to bribe US politicians to vote for more ""aid"" and to do Israel's bidding. The scale of Israel's overt bribery http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-scale-of-israeli-bribery-of-us.html This does not include how much dark money is used because it is very difficult to trace dark money funding. Nor does it count how much money is spent on other political lobbying to get US politicians to do Israel's bidding - e.g. by funding AIPAC, related political influence peddling groups and US media.

Other countries are catching on.

""Bandar Bush"" buys votes in Congress for war in Syria
Multiple intelligence sources in Washington, London, Beirut, and Paris claim that Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan has paid off key members of the U.S. Senate and House leadership, as well as key ministers of the French government, with ""incentive cash"" to support an American and French ""shock and awe"" military strike on not only Syria but Hezbollah positions in Lebanon.
Prior to the agreement on the last-minute Russian-U.S. “Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons” worked out between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State John Kerry in Geneva, Kerry ordered all U.S. diplomats out of Lebanon in preparation for a U.S. strike on targets mainly in south Beirut and south Lebanon. That move prompted Lebanese intelligence to examine Bandar’s lobbying activities in Washington and Paris.
Bandar was chiefly behind the shipment of weapons to Syrian rebels from arms caches seized by Islamist Salafist and Muslim Brotherhood guerrillas in Libya from Muammar Qaddafi's forces. That operation, which was botched by a series of circumstances, including the dissemination of an anti-Muslim video on YouTube and a failed covert operation conducted under the auspices of a classified President Finding signed by Barack Obama and implemented by then-National Security Adviser and current CIA director John Brennan, resulted in the September 12, 2012 attack on a Central Intelligence Agency annex in Benghazi. The attack resulted in the deaths of four U.S. government personnel, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.
Rival Libyan groups loyal to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, respectively, also contributed to the failure of the weapons buying operation in Benghazi. Pro-Saudi Salafists were upset that pro-Muslim Brotherhood rebels were reaping huge amounts of cash from Libyan weapons being shipped on Qatar Airways cargo flights from Benghazi to Turkey for later distribution to Syrian rebels. Afghanistan veterans of the Saudi-funded Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which battled Qaddafi's forces for a number of years and were members of Al Qaeda, got their revenge on Qatar and the CIA by attacking the U.S. ""diplomatic annex"" in Benghazi. The Obama administration launched a cover-up to keep secret the nature of the CIA's weapons transfer operation from Libya to Syria.

Bandar Bush's move to get America to start an overt outright war in Syria was only thwarted by the huge public outcry against it and the thousands of phone calls made by the public to Congressional offices.

The war in Syria has always been about rival gas pipelines, money and power (isn't it always?).
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have already spent over $6bn in funding & arming mostly Islamic Extremist groups fighting against Assad - bribery of US politicians is by far the cheaper option.

The easiest & cheapest way for China to take over global hegemony from the US is to bribe US politicians with dark money.
They have already started in a small way in a couple of State legislators.
The Chinese have bought a 50 sq mile area of land in Idaho and set up an ""economic development zone"" in it. In reality this is to facilitate more Chinese imports into the US.
The Chinese have set up a similar but much smaller ""economic development zone"" in Michigan.
The $5bn deal to buy America's largest pork producer has been approved.
The Chinese have purchased 3 small US retail banks to facilitate financial transactions between China & US. These banks also offer Yuan / Dollar currency exchange - something that is not otherwise easy to do for normal businesses & people.
China's medium term plan is to replace the US Dollar as the Global Reserve Currency, replace the IMF & World Bank for international loans and to replace the Federal Reserve as the primary arbiter of global monetary policy. 

With current US government policy it is only a question of time before it is widely recognized that the US has lost it's hegemony. With current policies that time is not that far away. Perhaps about 20 years. (It will take longer than 20 years for the new shape of the world to fully pan out - perhaps another 30.)",geopolitics,CIA

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stratfor_email_leak

>WikiLeaks founder **Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad,** and especially its targeting of activist organizations.[5] He also called the company a ""shadow CIA"" and stated that the emails would ""reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.""[24]

>Al Akhbar, citing internal emails from the **Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi**, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]

>An email involving **a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.**[11]

>emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, a former **Goldman Sachs director, along with other informants, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets.** They created an offshore ""share structure"" known as ""StratCap"" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations.

---

**Rethinking Russia**: The main argument of your book is that the international factors played a key role in the Syrian civil war. What kind of factors are those?

**Christopher Phillips**: I make three main arguments about how those international factors both led to the escalation of the conflict and prolonged it. The main conclusion is that the international context that the Syrian uprising began in is the key to its transformation from a domestic uprising into a major civil war.

In 2011, the environment of the Middle East was really changing as the result of the 2003 Iraq war. The Iraq war unleashed a whole load of different unexpected forces that destabilised the region in different ways. It weakened the USA, which prior to that was dominant in the region. Then it attempted regime change in Iraq: it toppled the Saddam’s regime, but could not actually pacify the country. This outcome shifted the perceptions of US power inside and outside America. The Americans, as a result, were less interested in being involved in the Middle East in general. When Barack Obama came to power, he was very much of the opinion that George W. Bush had been wrong to get so involved in Iraq, and that he had the mandate to step back. From the very beginning, you have the USA not wanting to be as active in the region as they have been in the past.

In that vacuum you have all the other powers coming to the fore. There were the ambitious states like Qatar and Turkey, both of which in different ways benefitted from the political and economic consequences of the 2003 Iraqi war. Both states saw in Syria an opportunity to enhance their own positions. There were Iran and Saudi Arabia, who have been having a long-standing rivalry that goes back to the 1979 revolution, but until 2003 Iraq acted as some kind of a barrier between the two. With Saddam’s removal, Iran was allowed to expand its influence into Iraq and globally, and Saudi Arabia started to worry about this expansion. When the Syrian unrest exploded, Iran felt that if it lost Syria, it would lose all its recent gains, and Saudi Arabia felt that winning Syria over to its side was an important opportunity.

Then, of course, there was Russia that in 2003 saw a failure of the USA in Iraq, and began to see an opportunity in Syria. It has been sort of shy or maybe weak after the end of the Cold War, but as the 2000s progressed, it became more and more confident and willing to step forward. When unrest began in Syria – a traditional ally of Russia – it worried that if the US allies won in Syria, then Russia would lose another country to the USA in the Middle East. As time progressed, Moscow began to see an opportunity in Syria to take advantage of American weakness, and to show that Russia stands by its allies – unlike what the US has done in Syria.

This created a scenario in which these six external actors – Turkey, Qatar, Russia, USA, Saudi Arabia, and Iran – are not all looking at Syria with the alarms “there is a civil war here, we must try to stop it”, but rather are looking at an opportunity to enhance their own regional goals. This regional environment is crucial.

The second conclusion is that once the conflict is under way, the individual decisions made by these leaders played a major role in tipping the balance from a domestic uprising to a civil war. The external actors contributed to the violence of the civil war. In my book, I put a lot of emphasis on the role of the USA in fuelling the flames of war. It is odd that you have USA that is weaker and actually less interested in getting involved, but at the same time the language it uses is that of a hawk. Barack Obama called on Assad to stand down in August 2011, and the next year in August 2012 he said that if the regime used chemical weapons, that would be the red line. This language suggests that the USA is going to take on Assad and bomb this regime like Libya and Iraq.

**RR:** Especially considering that the English language offers excellent options like “Assad might want to consider stepping down”, rather than “Assad must step down”…

**CP:** Exactly, this is very charged rhetoric. What is interesting is that we know now from Barack Obama’s private interviews, and I have also interviewed some of the policy-makers from his Administration, that Obama never wanted to get involved in Syria, that he thought that the language would be enough, and that he did not plan to follow up. But no one communicated this to the Middle East.

**RR:** How is this possible that the Arab Street never actually got the message that the USA will not be getting involved, and some parts of it still continue to call on Washington for action, and shame Obama for the lack of it?

**CP:** In the Middle East there is a huge myth about the USA, that the USA is very powerful – just look at the weaponry it has deployed in Iraq and elsewhere, this country must be behind everything. This is what is feeding the conspiracy theories. And this is promoted by both US allies and US enemies. Iran and Syria say: “Look how powerful US is, and we stand up to them”. The Saudis and the Turks say: “Look how powerful the US is, and we are their allies”. When the leader of this country says that there is a red line for Assad, everyone thinks that he means it. And it came as a real shock to people that there was no help coming. Actually this played a major role in escalating the conflict, because the people were much more likely to take up arms since they thought that the USA was going to help them. I know based on the interviews that the US closest allies – Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar – told the members of the Syrian opposition that the intervention was coming and all they needed to do was to capture some territory and then the US would come. These countries were incentivizing the opposition to fight rather than to negotiate.

On the flipside you also get Russia and Iran reacting to this strong rhetoric of the United States. They do not know whether the US is bluffing or not, in the beginning they are not really sure on what to do about Assad as they do not really approve of him gunning people down in the streets. Iran sent advisors over to Damascus asking Assad to hold back, telling him that they support him but he should not kill people. When the US then says that Assad must go, the Russians and the Iranians then suddenly transform their view of the Syrian conflict, and see this as a regional conflict against the US. Standing by Assad becomes totemic. Assad cannot fall, because if he falls, then the US will win.

This is a story about the USA using hawkish rhetoric that it does not plan to act on, which plays a major role since it pushes everyone – inadvertently in many ways – to conflict.

The third point is that once the war is under way, there are two processes in the background that make the war more likely. There is the agency of the individual state leaders who, once the war begins, push the people more towards war, and once the war is under way in 2012-2013, all of the actors play a role in prolonging the conflict. They do this by doing what political scientists call “a balanced intervention”. Rather than one side intervening and giving one of the protagonists enough to win, multiple actors intervene. They send weapons, finances, in the case of Iran – troops, in the case of Russia in 2015 – planes, sending the support to each protagonist. They provide for each side enough to keep fighting, but not providing enough to win. This has happened on both sides. Pro-Assad states (Russia and Iran) have consistently provided for Assad more than the anti-Assad states provided to the opposition, but still they did not provide enough. Assad is still too weak to conquer the whole of Syria. It is not a complete stalemate because the conflict has ebbed and flowed, but the structure of the conflict is that no side can really win. The sides do not have enough resources to win, they have enough resources to continue fighting, and these resources are coming from the outside.

**RR:** But is it really fair to say that the American engagement was words only? What about supporting opposition groups, acting through allies, bombing ISIS, etc?

**CP:** The US has been involved on multiple levels. The big myth is that the US has not done anything in Syria. It has done a lot. When people complain about the USA not intervening, they mean that Washington did not send its air force or troops on the ground against Assad. What the USA has done, they sent the air force against ISIS in the east, and offered various levels of support to the opposition: political support to the political exiles and endorsing the elements of the armed opposition, since June 2013 or maybe earlier. The CIA has been involved in a program of arming some opposition fighters, definitely through Jordan, possibly through Turkey as well, and at one point there was also a separate Pentagon program arming a different set of rebels specifically against ISIS, and more recently they have been arming and supporting the Kurdish fighters through the Syrian Democratic Forces. However, by US standards, all this is quite modest. They were very concerned whom these weapons were going to, and they were also worried about the large prevalence of the jihadists within the opposition.

**RR:** How do you understand Russia’s Syria policy? How much importance do you give to the anti-ISIS fight in all this?

**CP:** Russia’s policy needs to be understood in two parts. Up until 2014, Russia’s view of Syria was mostly defensive. You could see it in the support given to Assad in the UN, financial support, and supplying some weaponry – and that was about it. Actually, at that time the leading ally of Assad was Iran, not Russia. As one Russian analyst told me, the key word was not Assad, it was “regime change”. Moscow wanted to prevent regime change in Damascus. There are genuine fears in Moscow and Tehran that if regime change gains momentum, they might be next. The intervention in the Ukraine shifted Putin’s perspective on Syria. I think it meant that he began to see opportunities vis-à-vis the United States. It was about increasing and improving Russia’s position. I was in Moscow just after the annexation of the Crimea, and I saw that it was a very popular action, even though it was followed by a round of sanctions. Putin wants to be on the world stage, he wants to be recognized as a world leader, he does not want to be seen as a pariah. He can sell to the Russians that he is standing up for the Russians in the post-Soviet space, but actually what he wants is to be able to go to the world events and be seen as an equal to the US President. That is why Syria was perceived by him and his policy makers as an opportunity. Intervening meant that there was a plan that Russia can go into Syria, and can then make itself a leading international actor on Syria. This would therefore necessitate the USA to resume communications with Russia because after the intervention, if you want to sort out the problems in Syria, you would now need to go to Moscow. That was a very conscious shift by Putin.

**RR:** Did it work?

**CP:** I will come back to it. This was his primary motivation, but there were others. We should not underestimate “the fight against ISIS” argument; I think it was Putin’s genuine concern on multiple levels. Russia has a history with violent jihadism. Let’s not forget the bombing in the airport Domodedovo in 2011, and people in the West tend to forget it. They assume that when Putin talks about the necessity to fight ISIS, that he is being cynical. But there is a genuine concern there and, of course there was a large flow of Russian Caucasian fighters going to Syria to fight.

However, experts say that if Putin is in this war to fight ISIS, why is he then attacking all sorts of groups that are fighting Assad, not only ISIS? I think that there is a degree of cynicism there, but I spoke to the Russian policymakers, and they told me that they see Assad as the defence against ISIS. They think that if Assad is defeated, and it does not matter whether by the moderate opposition or anyone else, eventually ISIS will be victorious. For the Russians, saving Assad and eliminating Assad’s enemies, no matter how moderate they are, actually is a way to fight ISIS. This is how I think it needs to be understood.

**RR:** Why do you think this connection does not get noticed? Should we blame the Russian army for not talking enough to the diplomats? Or is Russia talking, but no one is listening?

**CP:** Actually, what I noticed in my interviews was how well informed the Russian diplomats were about the Syrian situation. I did not speak to many Russian military figures, because when I was doing the interviews in Russia, its military intervention had not started yet. I was very conscious of how much they understood of what was going on inside Syria. They also understood very clearly the US position. Lavrov very early on understood that Obama’s administration does not want to get involved in the Middle East.

However, if I were to criticize the Russian foreign policy community, I think they slightly misjudged their understanding of the Syrian regime. They understood the geopolitics quite clearly, but there was this assumption which goes back to your question on whether it worked. There was an assumption that this war was a little thing, and if a major super power like Russia stepped in, it would be sorted out in six months. Russia misjudged how weak Assad’s military was. He oversold the state of his military to Moscow, who then realised that this is not a machine fit for fighting, but is held together with a sticky tape. Russia also misunderstood the level of Iranian penetration in the regime. Sometimes it is presented as if Russia and Iran are on the same page in Syria, they are not. They are allies of convenience, but they have very different priorities in Syria. If you look where they are located, the Iranians are interested in the route to Hezbollah, so they are focusing on the strip from Damascus airport, through southern Damascus, over the Qalamun Mountains into Lebanon. The Russians are based on the coastal side with a base in Tartus. Also their constituencies are very different. The Russians are focusing their energy on the Syrian military, and they are focusing on the Syrian Alawites and Christians. The Iranians are focusing on the non-military militia, on national defence forces who they helped build, and they are focusing on the very small Shia community. They both want to save Assad, but they are parallel to each other, and I think that this is one of the misunderstandings that the Russians made of Syria. They presumed that they will get to dictate the terms. But actually the Iranians have been spending three to four years deeply penetrating the regime, and the Russians had limited influence, because Assad has another patron whom he can turn to if the Russians push him in the wrong direction. There was a very interesting incident when another cease-fire of Aleppo broke three weeks ago, and the Russians were not the ones who broke it. It was the Syrians and the Iranians, and the Russians had to play catch-up. The fact that the Syrians have the audacity to do that shows that they are not simply in awe of the Russians, they are conscious that they can leverage Russian power with the Iranians, and the other way round. Paradoxically, this very weak dictator Assad has been able to suck in these two large powers to pursue his own agenda. My observation would be that I am not certain that the Russian military knows how to extricate itself from Syria if it does not get the result it desires.

However, I need to mention that the war in Syria is not that costly for Moscow. Officially, Russia has lost only 20 servicemen, which is of course terrible for their families, but it is the same number that Turkey has lost in a month and a half. In terms of money, the estimated cost is $4 million a day, but Russia’s military budget is $50 billion a year. Furthermore, after Russia showed its weaponry in Syria, it already signed about $7-8 billion of new arms contracts. So in a way, it is up financially. While most Western commentators are expecting a Russian quagmire in Syria, I think it will be hard for Russia to extricate itself, but it is not costing them enough at the moment to cause an unwanted exit.

**RR:** Could you, please, comment on the Russian-Turkish relations? There was a lot of tension, there was a terrible incident, sanctions, apologies – and now everything is back to normal. Is it?

**CP:** The Turkey-Russia situation is quite interesting. It is about an imbalance in regional power. Erdogan has a greatly inflated sense of Turkey’s importance and power. He felt that it would not hurt Turkey to send its militia into Syria or into Iraq to bully the Iraqi government, and when Russia entered Syria, it mistakenly applied the same approaches to Russia and very oddly shot down this Russian jet and killed the Russian fighter pilots. Erdogan was simply not used to a serious rival in the region and, of course, Russia responded very quickly and very harshly with economic sanctions. Turkey’s economy was already suffering, and cutting down the flow of Russian tourists was disastrous. Russia played hard ball with Turkey and forced it to retreat. Turkey has shifted its perspective on Syria: it is being less aggressively anti-Assad, it is prioritizing the conflict with ISIS, and it made amends with Russia by apologizing. Russia basically said “you must say you were wrong”, and Erdogan admitted it, and as a result the sanctions have been lifted. Turkey is now more coming in line with the Russian view than Russia coming in line with Turkey’s view.

What was interesting about this was that Russia absolutely used economic power here. It did not threaten Turkey with invasion; it simply said that Turkey needed Russia economically more than Russia needed Turkey.

**RR:** Do you think there was some build-up prior to the accident, related to Crimea? There were numerous protests in Turkey in favour of the rights of the Crimean Tatars – far more than anywhere else…

**CP:** This is all related to Erdogan’s desire to position himself outside of Turkey as a beacon for Muslim minorities – whether these are Turkmen in Syria or Tatars in Crimea or Bosniaks in Bosnia. He wants to present himself as a kind of hero. I am very cynical about his motives; I do not think he actually cares about these people; he is trying to play to a domestic audience. He was never going to do anything about the Tatars in Russia or Bosniaks in Bosnia, he just wants to present himself to his home base as a sort of powerful regional leader. And it cost him in Syria where he sent in his militia, which then radicalized, and now Turkey is being accused of facilitating the rise of ISIS by turning the blind eye on these groups going back and forth across the border. A lot of this came as a result of Erdogan’s personal viewpoint, rather than from Turkey’s strategic interests.

**RR:** Could you please describe the positions of the six countries involved in Syria at the moment? Where do they stand now, especially the USA with President Trump entering the White House?

**CP:** It is a war that nobody won. No one is in as better position than they were in January 2011. Everyone is worse off; it is just a matter of a degree. Broadly speaking, the states that wanted to topple Assad – the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey – are all in a weaker position. They all spent a huge amount of effort trying to get rid of Assad, and did not succeed. The USA looks weaker in the eyes of its allies. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey wanted Washington to take the lead against their enemy, but Obama decided that it was not in the US interest to do so. Obama thinks that he did the right thing for the US, even though it might have been the wrong thing for the Middle Eastern countries.

Now the US position will be determined by the actions of the new President. We do not know much about what Trump will be like in his foreign policy. We can use what he has said during the campaign, although distinguishing between campaign talk and what he might actually do when in office. If Trump’s campaign can be of any indication, he seems to be far more in favour of unilateralism rather than multilateralism. He does not seem to be in favour of any UN or NATO based solutions in Syria. Something that is going to be an alliance led campaign, like the one against ISIS, seems less likely. From that we can presume that he is not going to be likely to intervene against Assad. He has spoken against ISIS, so he will probably continue the campaign started by Obama. He has also spoken about his admiration for Vladimir Putin. There could be a deal put forward with regard to Syria and Russia, perhaps suggesting that America would end its support for the rebel forces and cede the Syria crisis for Putin to deal with, arguing perhaps that it is difficult for Russia to actually deal with it. He would be criticized for this brutal approach, but he is playing to the domestic audience, who have said repeatedly that they do not want to get involved in the Middle East anymore. But, of course, we do not know whether he will act upon the ideas expressed during the campaign or whether he will change them once confronted with the reality of the highest office.

As for the countries that supported Assad – Iran and Russia, they are not in a stronger position either. In January 2011 they both had an ally who controlled the entire territory of Syria, then a stable state. Now they are spending a lot of money trying to keep a small strip of land that allows them to say, “Look! Assad has not fallen, we have won.” But there is a huge area of ungoverned territory which is risky for both of them. And we still do not know who is going to win. Iran and Russia can declare a temporary increase in their regional position, but we still do not know whether it is sustainable. The only way to sustain it and claim victory is to walk out of Syria, but if they are going to stay there embedded in that country for 15-20 years, it might prove quite costly in the long run.

The Author makes three (3) critical mistakes.

---

>A) China will not oppose ROK/US intervention upon DPRK regime change or government change.

- Rival factions within DPRK will seek Beijing's support, hence with PRC intervention, weaker factions can gain China's approval as a defacto Beijing puppet regime to stabilize North Korea. Factions within the DPRK military can cooperate with PLA intervention force much more easily than cooperating or surrendering to ROK/US forces if their survival or power depended on it. This is obvious course of action when faced with possible annexation by ROK/US.

- Sino-DPRK 1961 MDT treaty is not void during period of instability; in fact, DPRK can say rival factions are CIA-sponsored insurgents, invoking helping from China, so China will still be legally obligated to defend DPRK during regime change, and especially if ROK/US crosses the DMZ under the pretext of ""humanitarian assistance"" or ""securing rogue nuclear weapons.""

- ROK/US to ""race"" China to DPRK facilities basically insinuates that PLA special forces are incapable of handling, securing, and recovering rogue nuclear materials by themselves. As a rising Great Power seeking to cement it's image as a responsible and capable power, it would likely insist that the DPRK nuclear materials will be in safe hands through Chinese intervention, and that US/ROK intervention may cause more harm than neccessary. If US still insists on using it's own special forces to capture DPRK rogue materials, then China would see this as a challenge, and demonstrate it's military prowess accordingly.

-----------

>2) ""Any plans for separation line in North Korea should be accompanied with conditions for Chinese withdrawal from North Korean territory.""

- This assumes that separation line moves from the DMZ to some area around Pyongyang, and assumes the ROK forces can ""beat"" PRC forces in a race to DPRK capital... (does the DMZ magically disappear and China get bogged down by winter storm or something?)

- This also assumes that upon securing and stabilizing DPRK territory, China will return this to ROK control.

- Under Sino-DPRK 1961 MDT treaty, the separation line will still be the DMZ, and it's likely China insist that ROK return DPRK sovereign territory back to the new faction government that China approves and installs with Beijing-backing.

-----

>3) ""China may want to project some military forces to prevent Russia from intervening to capture Rajin-Songbong ports; **The potential for Chinese-Russian conflict is also very real**""

- This is some science fiction - Russia would **NEVER** intervene to capture land from DPRK upon regime change. This author is fomenting an imaginary conflict between China and Russia, it's ridiculous.

They may have some different interests and some similar interests, but neither seems to want any kind of direct military conflict with the other, right?  

Both countries seem to be operating in increasingly close quarters in Syria, yet they’re not cooperating. We often hear from Russian and American officials that the two countries are deconflicting and communicating on various levels in order to reduce the chances of an accident, which is good.  

But what if an accident happens? For example, we know that both countries often embed special forces personnel and advisers with the SDF (in the US’s case) and the Syrian Arab Army (in Russia’s case). What if, for example, an American bomb accidentally ends up killing some Russian personnel embedded with the SAA? It could be because the Russians didn’t inform the US that they would have embedded troops at that location, or it could be that they did inform the US, but that not everyone on the American side had been brought up to speed. Maybe there was some miscommunication or someone forgot to do something important. And, of course, things could go the opposite way - the Russians could accidentally kill American advisers embedded with the SDF, and for similar reasons.  

Realistically, what would happen in that scenario? How likely is it that any escalation would be contained? How robust are the de-escalation mechanisms that are in place (if there are any). How likely is it that both sides would seek to de-escalate? Would de-escalation be less likely if the Russians accidentally killed Americans, or vice versa? Is there any precedent for this type of thing?  

From a purely practical point of view, it seems obvious that a war is not in either country’s interest, and the military and political leadership in both countries know that, right? Especially given that these are two nuclear powers. But how likely is it that, in the heat of the moment, cooler heads will prevail? It’s easy to talk about how, in theory, both sides would seek to de-escalate, but what’s to stop some overzealous mid-level officer from ordering a retaliation in the heat of the moment? And how do we know escalation won’t end there?  

On a related note: what, if anything, do you think *would* lead to an actual escalating military confrontation between the US and Russia? Could, say, a war between the US and Iran lead to it, considering how geographically and politically close Iran and Russia are? I’ve heard Trump wants to make Mike Pompeo Secretary of State and put Tom Cotton in charge of the CIA. They both have somewhat confrontational views towards Russia.

2. What accounts for the disparity in the choice of force? Like in Western Europe, USA used economic force to build a formidable military alliance while in Japan, USA rather ironically occupied Japan to demilitarize Japan and eventually build a strong economy. And Saudi Arabia remains an ally of the USA. On the other hand, in Vietnam, Afghan, Chile, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, Iran have been acquired with, then with the power of force. And the long-lasting has always been those with of SA, EU, JAP etc which was based on mutual trade and prosperity and of course included geopolitical considerations. But, the question is does liberalism has a better effect in building alliances? i.e. this aspect concerns on the bilateral relationship between USA and the other nation.

4. How are emerging countries destinies going to be determined in the future?

**Summary**

Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said Aug. 21 that Islamic State militants cannot be defeated without a comprehensive approach that takes into account the group's presence in both Iraq and Syria. While neither Dempsey nor Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directly stated that the United States intended to carry out operations in Syria, their comments indicate that there is a potential for increased U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict in pursuit of the Islamic State. Were Washington to decide to strike directly in Syria, it could align itself with any number of groups. Each scenario presents different levels of risk, and with more risk comes a greater chance of success.

**Analysis**

The most limited U.S. option in Syria would be to carry out a set number of targeted airstrikes focused on high-value Islamic State leaders, possibly including top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The detailed intelligence needed for such an approach would require the United States to cooperate with several regional actors. And while such strikes could degrade the Islamic State's leadership, Dempsey noted Aug. 21 that air power alone would not significantly hinder the group's capabilities. It would, however, offer a means of combating the militant group without the United States necessarily becoming entangled in the Syrian civil war, something Washington has avoided so far.

Washington could also opt for a more comprehensive approach. This could include targeting significant concentrations of Islamic State forces, their energy infrastructure or their supply depots and logistics networks across Syria and Iraq. Were the United States to pursue this course, it would need to factor in the impact of these strikes on the balance of the civil war. More directly, the U.S. Air Force would have to take into account the air power, air defenses and command and control capabilities of the al Assad regime.

In the more comprehensive scenarios, the United States would then have to choose between coordinating with the Syrian regime to determine targeting and flight parameters -- preferably covertly with the help of Iraq or even Iran -- or actively deterring regime interference. Both options are very risky politically. Cooperation with al Assad would open the U.S. administration to serious domestic and foreign political blowback, while the second option could derail critical nuclear negotiations with Iran, a key ally of the Syrian regime.

Ultimately, even a broader air campaign would serve only to weaken rather than cripple the Islamic State. In order to severely degrade the group's capabilities, the United States would need to get involved in the Syrian conflict in a manner similar to its involvement in Iraq. In Syria this would entail active partnership with one or more of the key belligerents in the civil war -- involvement that carries its own risks.

In one version of this scenario, the United States could choose to partner with the forces fighting the al Assad regime by bolstering them with air power. Washington is already working with rebels to a large degree through a CIA program that provides arms and training. The Obama administration has also sought congressional funds to transition this into a more comprehensive U.S. Special Operations Command effort. Were the United States to partner with rebels through enhanced weapons transfers, embedded special operations forces or air power, it would upgrade the relationship significantly and risk severe blowback. The Syrian rebels are not a homogenous or unified force and their affiliations are murky and in flux. Both domestic U.S. and international critics would fault the administration for potentially directly or indirectly supporting extremist forces, especially if U.S. weapons were found in jihadists' hands. The United States would also face difficulty pushing the rebels toward fighting the Islamic State because rebel combat power is currently directed against regime forces. And any U.S. alignment with rebels would embroil it in conflict with the Syrian regime, especially while Syrian air defenses and air power are still a viable force. This, by extension, could affect nuclear talks with Iran.

Conversely, the United States could elect a gradual rapprochement with the Syrian regime in mutual support against the Islamic State. This relationship would likely have to be open; a more covert working relationship would stand in the way of comprehensive operations. The United States could do this by removing sanctions against the Syrian regime, transferring select equipment or by providing air support. This has the advantage of bolstering the U.S. position in nuclear negotiations with Iran. It would also provide a more viable means of defeating the Islamic State over the long term. This option is not viable, however, because it would necessarily involve a reversal of the current U.S. position. Abandoning rebel allies would also severely degrade U.S. alliances with Turkey, Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council and would open the Obama administration to domestic political attacks.

Finally, there is an interim option: Washington could bolster the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, in a manner similar to its partnership with the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga. One of the advantages of the People's Protection Units is that they have already proved capable in previous combat with the Islamic State. This alliance would also be of less concern to the Syrian rebels and the al Assad regime, but it would also have a smaller impact because the People's Protection Units operate only in Kurdish-populated areas. U.S. ally Turkey is also suspicious of the group because of its ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which operates inside Turkey.

The least risky scenarios the United States can pursue -- limited airstrikes or alignment with the People's Defense Forces -- are also the least likely to damage the Islamic State in the long run. In Iraq, the United States is pursuing cooperation through longstanding relationships with the Iraqi government and the peshmerga. The Syrian situation, however, is much more complex. In upping its chances of success, Washington also opens itself to a host of secondary risks and negative side effects. Given the administration's risk-averse nature, the United States may very well elect to pursue the independent, more limited approach in Syria. Overall, however, the fact remains that the United States has no easy options in Syria.

Nevertheless, Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, offers that the US ignored or even actively killed off in order to *prevent* a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive as a justification for a policy of imposing regime-change.

Even in the first Obama administration, Iran agreed to the terms of a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey according to which Iran would have exported its enriched uranium in the hopes of receiving the reactor fuel it had been denied, only to see the Obama administration pull the rug out from under them AFTER Iran had said yes to the deal, upsetting the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just a week earlier endorsing the same terms that Iran had agreed to

http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

One American expert on Iran affairs, noted that the very day after Iran had agreed to these terms, the US proceeded to impose yet more sanctions on Iran

http://garysick.tumblr.com/post/611735702/giving-the-finger-to-iran-and-turkey-and

The Bush administration had started out imposing an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -

http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/

which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty to be able to make their own reactor fuel (which thanks to US sanctions, Iran was not able to import as usual.) This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal by making demands that *no country would accept.*

The second Obama admin eventually dropped the zero enrichment demand, http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-backed-key-u-s-shift-toward-iran-nuclear-deal-1441753099?mod=rss_US_News

and thus signaled that it is willing to actually resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. 

The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are POSSIBLY finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.

That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the pro-Israeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.

http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam

There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity.

http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530

So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs. 

To make up for the lack of evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program in the past, the issue is instead framed as concern about Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes in the indefinite future.

In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably.

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes.
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There is a significant difference: the *capability* to make nukes is not illegal but the media coverage obfuscates this significant difference. In fact the NonProliferation Treaty is actually also intended to *promote* nuclear technology (which has to be shared ""to the fullest extent possible"" and ""without discrimination"") -- thus having the ""capability"" to make nukes is not a violation of the NPT but actually an inevitable part of following the NPT.  

The US National Intelligence Estimate concluded that while Iran was engaged in ""nuclear-related studies"" until 2003 (for which the actual evidence is very questionable - more below) there's no sign they're interested in nukes now -

a conclusion that the Israelis agreed with, http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/mossad-cia-agree-iran-has-yet-to-decide-to-build-nuclear-weapon-1.419300 

The Russians noted there was no evidence of nukes either http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/10/iran.russia

There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.

>Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php

According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:

>I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html

And

>With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

and

>The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece

Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director

>The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703

and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required, in addition to suspending enrichment of uranium entirely for more than 2 years in the past, and currently.

>""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it

Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA
http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511

So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks) say Iran is not making nukes

And actual arms inspectors

>Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case. 

http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=13286 And 5 European ambassadors to Iran say that too
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace


And actual nuclear experts
http://original.antiwar.com/yousaf-butt/2014/06/18/what-is-the-quality-of-scientific-evidence-against-iran/

http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/22/us-nuclear-iaea-nonaligned-idUSL2187147520071122

The US has been pushing some documents as proof that Iran supposedly engaged in nuclear-related studies (Called the ""Alleged Studies"" by the previous IAEA director, and ""Possible Military Dimensions"" by the new, US-backed IAEA director) until 2003 however the evidence -- to the extent the US has actually let anyone including the IAEA or Iran to see -- has been laughed at
http://www.ips-dc.org/whipping_wisps_into_storm_clouds_iran_and_the_alleged_studies/

There have also been a variety of half-baked leaks of ""proof"" of a nuclear weapons program in Iran, for example the ""AP Graph""
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-graph-suggests-iran-working-bomb
which turned out to be a hoax
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/ap-iran-nuclear-program-graph-explanation as was the general quality of the scientific evidence against Iran
http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/Flawed-graph-weakens-case-against-Iran-nuclear-program-video

The US had even pressured the IAEA to accept these documents as proof against Iran, but the IAEA refused, and the IAEA director Elbaradei called the allegations ""hype"" leading to some in Congress to accuse the IAEA of ""censoring"" the reports and hiding a ""Secret Annex""
http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/05/iaeas-man-in-dc-no-secret-annex-on-iran/
which proved Iran's nuclear weapns program's existence. The Israelis even accused the IAEA head Elbaradei of being an ""Iranian agent"" http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4146150,00.html.

The US went after Elbaradei, http://no.alt.diskusjoner.usa.narkive.com/dCbdwInF/jakten-pa-elbaradei including tapping his telephones http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57928-2004Dec11.html.

The IAEA replied that charges of it censoring info on Iran are ""baseless and politically-motivated"" http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917
and that there was still no evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran,
http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917

But once the new US-backed IAEA Director, Amano, came into office after a highly contested election http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/26/us-nuclear-iaea-election-idUSTRE52O7P220090326
in which he had secretly sworn loyalty to the US
http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks, and http://www.ips-dc.org/current_chief_of_iaea_releases_its_brakes_on_rush_to_war_with_iran/

Amano released the so-called ""Secret Annex"" that the previous iAEA director had refused to endorse, which supposedly proved everything about Iran's nuclear weapons program -- but despite the pre-release hype, it turned out to be a dud that didn't say anything new, and actually showed the evidence against Iran was ""thin"" as a former IAEA inspector concluded
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1109/Iran-nuclear-report-Why-it-may-not-be-a-game-changer-after-all

Later, the trial of a CIA whistleblower showed that the CIA may have even been planting evidence in Iran, so it could frame Iran
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-20/cia-s-nuclear-bomb-sting-said-to-spur-review-in-iran-arms-case
This book is all about that
http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338

In short, the previous US policy of trying to use the exaggerated threat of a non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons program as a pretext and justification for a policy of imposing regime-change in Iran, was a giant backfiring fiasco. It only led to Iran's further development of its nuclear program which now the US has to negotiate down, and also created a nationalistic backlash in Iran, where the vast majority of poeple support their governments position.
http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR910.html
http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/652.php

And actually Iran had been making BETTER offers that the US ignored
> In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  **Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered.**

According to the UN, from 1980 {after the Islamic Revolution} Iran's Human Development Index improved 67%, and Iran became a Highly Developed country.

China's HDI improved 70%, in comparison.


>According to UNDP calculations, between the years 1980 and 2012, Iran’s HDI value increased by 67 per cent – or at an average annual increase of about 1.6 per cent. During the same period, for other countries in the High Human Development group (the group containing Iran), the average annual gain was only about half of what Iran managed – 0.73 per cent. For all countries on the planet, the average gain was even less – only 0.69 per cent. This means that **Iran’s annual growth in its HDI was over double the global average**. Simultaneously, this would imply that – from a human development standpoint – during the period 1980-2012, Iran’s policy interventions were both significant and appropriate to produce improvements in human development.

This was *despite* post-revolutionary chaos, low oil prices, an 8-year war with a US-backed Saddam which included being targeted by chemical warfare (with direct US complicity, http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/ ) sanctions, sabotage, and Iran *single-handedly* hosting the world's largest refugee population of *4.5 million people.* http://www.unhcr.org/3b6814092.html
 
In comparison, Iran's HDI before the 1979 Islamic Revolution when the US-backed Shah was in power, was low and not rising http://www.photius.com/rankings/human_developement_index_1975-2005.html
 

This perhaps explains why most people in Iran are in fact content with their govt according to multiple independent polls (even taking into account any self-censorship by the respondents
)
http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/652.php

Every official in Iran, btw, is either elected directly or appointed by an elected body 
and Iranians regularly turn out for their elections at a rate of about 60% http://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Parsons_0.pdf

The level of educational attainment alone is amazing. http://www.mei.edu/content/educational-attainment-iran

FYI, for example, before the revolution, only about half the people were even literate.http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427elojmjo966q; 

Lieracy rates for women in particular was about 40%, but today more than 60% of Iran's university population is female, where they also form a significant portion of students in the sciences and high-technology fields

>Almost 60 percent of accepted applicants in recent years have been women, with tertiary participation rates among women doubling over the last two decades. http://wenr.wes.org/2013/04/wenr-april-2013-an-overview-of-education-in-iran/

https://web.archive.org/web/20000418102534/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/INST/jul99/iran.html

In fact Iranians as a whole are some of the best educated people in the world, 

>Iran’s education sector is the Middle East’s largest and most dynamic. A country of nearly 80 million, 60% of its population is under 30. It has one of the highest tertiary-education-to-workforce ratios in the world, 4.5 million tertiary students in any given year (significantly more than any other Middle Eastern nation), and ranks globally between Australia and the United States (US) as having 43% of its population holding tertiary qualifications. Remarkably by international standards, female tertiary education enrolment has also outstripped male student enrolment, with 60% of Iranian university students being women.
http://dearinassociates.com/tapping-iran-dynamic-education-sector-an-introduction-for-australian-institutions-and-business/

and Iran has some well-recognized universities that put out world-class graduates http://www.newsweek.com/surprising-success-irans-universities-87853 

And Iran is judged to be a world leader in areas such as biotech and nanotech

http://www.cientifica.com/nanotechnology-in-iran-well-organised-and-impressive/

And the ""fastest growing nation"" in the sciences, generally
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country/

Apart from educational attainments, Iran's healthcare system is considered to be a world model, responsible for extending lifespans by an average of 22 years
http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2013/apr/01/un-stats-life-longer-and-healthier-iran

Not only does Iran have one of the world's highest ratios of doctors to patients, its medical delivery system for the poor and disadvantaged is being copied even in the USA 
http://www.aarp.org/health/doctors-hospitals/info-06-2010/iranian_cure_for_thedeltas_blues.html

In addition to having the Mideast's only condom factory, Iran's drug treatment and HIV programs as well as its family planning and organ transplant programs are also considered to be world models

As a rapidly developing nation, Iran actually needs to diversify its energy resources, and rely less on oil (which it is actually short of)

Lacking any actual evidence of any nuclear weapons program, the US instead claims that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons ""capability"", a capability that is simply an unavoidable part of having a nuclear energy program. More than 40 nations -- *about 1 out of 4 nations on Earth* -- already have the capability of making nukes quickly if they wanted to

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

The reason they don't, is because nukes are overrated

http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

http://www.ippnw.de/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomwaffen/Mousavian_s_Lecuter_at_IPPNW_Berlin-October_22--2012.pdf

In reality, Iran's nuclear program was quite legal
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace

Not only had Iran allowed all *legally-required inspections* http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511

Iran voluntarily suspended enrichment for close to 3 years and had allowed *more inspections* than it was legally required to permit, with no evidence of a nuclear weapons program ever found

>""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be.""
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it

Iran had also been making *better compromise offers* than what was negotiated recently, but its offers were ignored in favor of an imposed regime change agenda

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html

And the US even killed-off deals *after Iran had said yes* to demands by the US

Amb Chas Freeman has noted

> In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered. http://lobelog.com/lessons-from-americas-continuing-misadventures-in-the-middle-east/

And IAEA Director Elbaradei has noted
>I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges. 
http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

Instead

>“They weren’t interested in a compromise with the government in Tehran, but regime change – by any means necessary,” http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

Instead of accepting any of these offers, the US kept moving goalposts and making increasing demands on Iran that were deliberately intended to be unacceptable including the demand that Iran *give up* its nuclear program first *before* negotiations could be held about that nuclear program. This was known as ""Zero Enrichment""

https://lobelog.com/laying-zero-enrichment-to-rest/

>""Iran must not have even one spinning centrifuge""

It was only when US finally gave up on the Zero Enrichment demand, in the second Obama administration, that the current deal became possible (*and not* because sanctions ""forced"" Iran to negotiate, since Iran had been trying to negotiate for a long time before)

And incidentally, by ignoring those *better* Iranian compromise offers in favor of creating yet another pretext for yet another stupid war in the Mideast for Israel, the US ended up causing Iran to *increase* the scope of its nuclear program. 

For example by denying Iran the right to *legally buy* fuel for a *medical reactor* that was not just *too small to be useful for nukes* but that the US had *given to Iran in the first place*, and was under *all applicable IAEA safeguards* (I'm referring to the Tehran Research Reactor or TRR) the US forced Iran to increase its enrlchment levels of uranium from about 3.5% to close to 20% - (which is still deemed as ""low enriched uranium"" well short of the over-90% enrichment required for weapons) in order to make its own fuel... 
 And then *that* quite predictable Iranian reaction was presented as evidence of Iran ""getting closer to making nukes"" -- never mind that Iranians repeatedly offered to cease higher-level enrichment if they could just buy the fuel from Argentina as usual, legally, but were ignored.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/opinion/30iht-edvaez30.html

Instead, the US demanded that Iran not buy the fuel, and not make the fuel, and those 800,000 Iranian cancer patients who relied on the reactor for medical isotopes should just go fuck themselves.  http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/302492/a-primer-on-irans-medical-reactor/

In fact as IAEA director Elbaradei noted, the US pressure on Iran only made the nuclear program more of a nationalistic issue there

>The line was ""Iran will buckle under the pressure"". But his issue has become so ingrained in the Iranian soul as a matter of national pride. They talk about their nuclear program as if they had gone to the moon. http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

and polls found that the Iranian *people* were actually more hardline than the govt on their nuclear program, with a growing portion supporting the idea of obtaining actual nuclear *weapons*
 http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR910.html

We also can't assume Iran must be seeking a nuclear *deterrent* through developing the capability to make nukes, though the Iranians themselves have stated that they were well aware that their nuclear program would provide them with weapons capability:


It is not logically possible to ptove that a country wont possibly one day, in the indefinite future, decide to make nukes however,  
aside from the fact that the Iranians suspended enrichment for years voluntarily as a gesture of good faith while in negotiation with the EU3 (which was undermined by the US
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html) the Iranians have long offered to voluntarily accept limits on their nuclear program *well-beyond* what is legally required, or accepted by other nation -not something a country seeking weapons capability would do.

81,Is it vital that one graduates with an IR/IS undergrad degree from a top program?,1.0,6sj6u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/6sj6u6/is_it_vital_that_one_graduates_with_an_iris/,4.0,1502253500.0,"Hello everyone, I apologize if this is not allowed. I lurk on this sub and realize that a lot of college students come here with questions - I am here to join their ranks.

Last May I completed my freshman year at a small liberal arts college. I will not list it so as not to doxx myself, but if someone asks me via PM I will share the information with you. Anyway, my college is not a particularly prestigious one, but it is well known in the region and has around 87/100 on US News and World Report in one of the ""Regional Colleges"" lists... Whatever that means. I have known that I wanted to double major in Economics and International Studies/Relations since I was in high school, and even though I got in to a few very good schools, such as Baylor and Boston College, I didn't receive any scholarships from these elite universities, and money was an issue for me, so I picked the college that gave me the most amount of financial aide - the liberal arts college that I attend now. I am an Economics and International Studies with Political Science double major, and I am actually quite close to a History minor as well. I would like to work for the US State Department or the CIA.

My college is quite small and I do not particularly enjoy the student body, I am very thankful that class sizes are small and I have easy access to my teachers. However, most of my teachers do not have a lot of experience in working on foreign policy - rather, they are all educators by trade, focusing on teaching students. I worry if this will put me at a disadvantage when compared with other graduates who took courses from well revered scholars and policy makers at places like Georgetown, Harvard, American University, etc. Additionally, my school's International Studies department is quite small, there are only about 7 students in my grade that are IS majors. There is no alumni group to network with, and my school is not located near New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, or other cities that have events and organizations for internships and other opportunities to network. We are in a small bubble and I feel isolated from the world that I desperately want to be a part of.

There is one key advantage for me at my current school: I am a very personable and outgoing person, and I virtually always make a lasting positive impression on people that I meet. Because of this, I have developed a bit of ""big fish in a small pond"" reputation, and have already been granted the opportunity to go on a month long Study Abroad in Russia, where I researched their history and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This coming year I will be spending a semester as an exchange student at a university in France, taking economic courses on the EU and hopefully becoming fluent in French. I believe that I will have the opportunity to study abroad in Africa and Latin America in the coming years if I stay at my small liberal arts college, my professors quite like me.

So I am stuck with this dilemma - If I am interested in going to an elite University to obtain a Master's in IR, and then work in some branch of foreign service, is it a good idea to consider transferring to one of the strong International Relations/Affairs/Studies programs and graduating there for undergrad? I think that my networking possibilities would be a lot stronger. Or would you all recommend that I stay put, go on as many study abroad as possible, try to get terrific LOR's, and graduate with a high GPA and be ready to roll to grad school? I know a lot of people in the D.C. area who claim that it's only worth getting an IR/IS Master's if you go to a top 10 program - Hopkins, Georgetown, MIT, Harvard, etc.

Do you all have any insight? Am I being an idiot? For whatever it's worth, I don't have much of an attachment to my current school, I see college as a means to an end. 

I understand that at the end of the day, the decision to stay or transfer is my own, so I am not looking for someone to tell me what to do, rather for you all to reflect on your experiences and provide me some perspective. Thank you.",geopolitics,CIA

 What happened to the CIA that brazenly went into other countries put in dictators loyal to the US to impose a global hegemony.    Ok that went to far but we should at least be trying to influence them like they are trying to do to us.

To make it short, I'm a 19 year old American applying for college to begin in spring 2016. I applied to University of North Texas for a major in International Studies - with a concentration in International Security and Diplomacy. 

I don't really know if this is a smart choice for a major, I would love to have a career in the State Department, CIA, or some other agency in the like that deals in national security, diplomacy, counter-terror, etc. The thing that makes me a little weary of the major is how well it would look for a future employer; the security/diplomacy seems perfect to me but what stands out to me is it is ""concentration"" within IS. Would the employers I mentioned (or the many other similar ones) rather have an international relations major for the type of roles I could face? 

My parents are both federal employees and unsurprisingly think it's a good idea, only my mother thinks I should study Arabic and the Middle East for the required language and region hours, and my father thinks it would be best for Russian/East Europe. However I would like your opinions, as my favorite subreddits and it would seem like many people here could give advice or information or words that could add to this. I would love any comments from anyone studying something similar as well!
