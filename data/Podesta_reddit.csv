EDIT: I just got back from eating, and this thread has gone off the charts. I'm really having trouble keeping up. From here on, I will only be able to reply to comments directly on my own comments, or ones that I am tagged in via ""/u/dataphreak"". In the mean time, it's time to start digging. We've exposed the Dow angle for motive to access the Secretary of State at the time, but there are plenty of other companies and dates. Each one deserves its own thread. Find stuff, post it, tag me in the comments, and I'll come check it out with you.

Stay safe.

1,2 years of compiled research available as PDF download or video format proves Pizzagate is 100% real. I have enough evidence for law enforcement in America to open up a real investigation.,6229.0,hn7crw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hn7crw/2_years_of_compiled_research_available_as_pdf/,1113.0,1594170479.0,"**EDIT: I don't have time to reply to everyone right now, but I will be leaving a detailed reply very soon. I will link in the comments. All you shills have zero effect on me. Keep drinking your cognitive dissonance cocktails.**

**Website:** [**www.seanspeaks.co.uk**](https://www.seanspeaks.co.uk) 

Hello people of the world. My names Sean. I am in investigative journalist who has covered Pizzagate extensively for the past 4 years. For anyone new to this subject, **pizzagate is about the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children in Satanic Rituals.** Its crazy how John Podestas leaked emails lead to this dark, satanic, pedo underworld where they do all this horrible stuff to kids. This scandal broke in November 2016 right before the presidential election. Since that day a massive disinformation campaign has been initiated to shut down all discussions of Pizzagate online. The Government and controlled Zionist mainstream media have done a fantastic job at completely discrediting the story without acknowledging any of the facts.

I have created this content in a easy, informative manner, to take the viewer on the same journey I did. **Caution: If you go down this rabbit hole it will completely change your perspective on life and the world around you.** Once you fully come to terms with what Pizzagate is actually about, it turns your stomach sick and compels you to do something about it.

Pizzagate is a giant jigsaw puzzle. When looking into this subject you need to treat it as if you were a detective investigating a crime. You would look at all the evidence to determine if the people implicated are involved in criminal activity or not. Pizzagate is an accumulation of circumstantial evidence which leads to one logical conclusion. **Serious corruption at the highest echelons of Government involving the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children.** The state will do anything, and everything in their power to stop this story from being fully understood by the public.

The evidence I have put together for you proves, without a shadow of a doubt, Pizzagate is real. It proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that law enforcement in the US must open up an investigation into Pizzgate immediately. **To be clear, that is what we need. A real investigation for trained professionals within the law.** This is not something people like me or you should be doing online. I have created my work this way so no one can argue and call it ***""fake news""***, or a ***""conspiracy theory"".*** My content is truthful, factual, and legitimate. End of story.

Once you fully understand the severity of this scandal. What you do about it is down to you. If you want to take a stand and fight back, for the sake of all the innocent children, then share this document far and wide. Share my videos on as any social media platforms as possible. Send my documents into law enforcement in you really want to. Call politicians, do something. We cannot sit back and allow this to go on any longer. If theres one thing we can all agree on, regardless our political or religious beliefs, of even the colours of our skin, **ITS THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN.**

Please help me wake as many people up as possible to the dark, sinister truth, which is Pizzagate. My presentation is part or the larger compendium which is called **#FREEDOMGATE.**  Freedomgate is my creation. Its a movement that all people of the world can get involved with for free. Freedomgate is about liberation, revolution, and freedom, for the entire human race. Full details can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate\_the\_revolution\_of\_the\_human\_race\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate_the_revolution_of_the_human_race_is/)

Please view my work in your own time. I just want to say that I love every single one of you who are out there fighting the good fight. We all just need to stick together, ride the wave, and see where it takes us. Thank you for reading. I appreciate you being here.

The moment I noticed it was missing, I checked the new section for the_donald, and someone had left the archived thread link in a comment, posted below this paragraph. The post made it to a little over 4 hours old and had over 5k upvotes, then poof. It was moderator removed due to being off topic. And granted, the screen cap says little more than ""there will be an attack on alfantis or a Podesta brother."" Still though, for them to allow something like this to remain for so long, and to make the top of r/all, it only raises questions. If anything, this post might get to the top of r/all and we see what happens. This is a throw away, no karma for me. At the very least, it keeps pizzagate in people's minds, and hopefully reminds everyone that there are always two sides to a story.

I would like to reiterate that the point of this post is not to prove pizzagate is real, and it is also not to prove the_donald should have left this post up.

'This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to 'pizzagate'

This doesn't mean the sub sucks because these theories and posts started. It was these theories and posts with (Imo)  sooooo much evidence to support them in turn brought in complete idiot accounts and people in to this community to discredit us and those theories. I mean Jesus christ guys, they shut down the pizzagate sub all together and then we had to go to Voat to discuss it. Imo- the DNC leaks proved that DNC rigged the primaries for Hillary against Bernie. Imo Seth rich was the leaker. Bang bang. Nothing like a good ol' random shotgun to the back at 4am with nothing stolen. And pizzagate... Well come on. If you have 1 brain cell and you did you research.. You know what's up.

Have a good day!

edit- someone brings up that Chris Cuomo, back when he had a CNN show, did a segment urging people not to read the Podesta WikiLeaks (shortly after Pizzagate came out), and suggested reading the WikiLeaks could even be ILLEGAL. Was Griffin (the recently charged CNN producer) his producer back when that segment aired? Who called for such an unusual segment, to scare people from searching online for a topic that - at the time - most did not care about or know about. Good point and would be great to pursue this connection also; i.e. where's that clip of Cuomo talking about the WikiLeaks?",conspiracy,Podesta

King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

/r/pizzagate now directs you to the following message:

**This subreddit was banned due to a violation of our content policy. Specifically, the proliferation of personal and confidential information. We don’t want witchhunts on our site.**

This is not the first time a sub has been closed down for contravening reddit rules relating to doxxing, brigading, harassment and witch-hunting. Amidst the cries of censorship, keep in mind that the admins are simply applying existing sitewide rules, and it's more than likely that reddit (and its majority owner [Avance Publications*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications)) have been pressured from external sources, with threats of litigation, removal of advertising revenue, etc. 

So, where does that leave /r/conspiracy?

""Pizzagate"" is a new aspect of an established conspiracy which has long been discussed, and will continue to be discussed, in this sub.

**The key issue is that we, as a group, must ensure we don't break the rules set out by the admins, or this subreddit could be next.**

The mods of /r/conspiracy have always been vigilant about preventing doxxing, brigading and harassment coming from this sub, and to their credit, the admins have respected our independence and rarely interfere in the way we moderate /r/conspiracy. 

This sub is many things, but it is not, and cannot under the terms of reddit, be a direct action group. 

We can discuss, theorize and rant about whatever we like, but there must be absolutely NO brigading and NO contacting or harassing individuals within or outside reddit, even if you suspect them of criminal activity. 

Anyone who engages in these activities poses an existential threat to this sub, so if you see any examples of this please notify the mods immediately, and we will remove the comments and report the offenders to the admins.

20,What I learned from my 2-week hiatus from Reddit,1603.0,6m77wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6m77wg/what_i_learned_from_my_2week_hiatus_from_reddit/,273.0,1499603797.0,"I recently visited a country that, much to my surprise, banned Reddit. Yes, I could've used a VPN but there was too much going on to really sit down and browse much anyway.

And in the two weeks of being detached from conspiracies (and the news in general), I learned this: a lot of it is a distraction that justifies our procrastination towards personal and unified greatness. It is, quite honestly, pointing a finger towards something else and ignoring the three pointing back at ourselves. We can read about war mongering overseas and don't contemplate the way we stereotype others. We can discuss the use of herbicide but then buy conventional produce instead of going organic. Or condemn Clinton and Podesta while doing nothing to strengthen our own moral compass.  

Upon reflection, I realize that focusing on conspiracies is sort of like Sodom and Gomorrah, and getting turned into a pillar of salt for looking back and watching the place burn. The only way out is forward: unmitigated, consistent focus on solutions and relentless self-improvement.  That's it. Because 97% of us can do absolutely nothing to ""take down TPTB"" in the way that we generally think (ie, combat, antagonism, etc). Exposure is valuable, yes, but only if it leads to meaningful change. 

It's getting to the point that I'm thinking if I comment on a conspiracy, I absolutely have to have some type of imperative or action-based statement accompanying it. Or, if I cannot spare the precious energy in the form of my attention, I should offer another form of it which is money (ie, donating to alternative news sites and YouTuber's). 

Our power lies in our ability to extricate ourselves from the awful--and often false--constructs manufactured in our society. For example, we can stop waiting for the oil industry to crumble and switch to solar within our homes. Downsize our vehicles or go electric. We can stop waiting for laws to be made that prevent degradation of the planet and go to a plant-based diet. We can stop worrying about the water scarcity problem and start rain harvesting, buy low water use toilets, re-design the backyard with drought tolerant plants, etc. 

For every such conspiracy-related problems (and there are many), we already have solutions. If we become that change, the problem ceases to exist. 

I understand that conversation among each other is extremely valuable... but what we say is important, too. Often our chatter is discussing the great and mighty powers of ""the elite"" and we seldom talk about the great and mighty power within ourselves, how we can enhance it, and how we can channel it to better humanity. 

I say this to everyone because I have been guilty of this procrastination. I look through my post history and if I'm honest, recognize that the majority of my comments are based in knowledge, sure, but not wisdom. Most of this sub are discussing a movie and obsessively complaining about how terrible it is, only to realize we have the power to hit the ""mute"" button and walk away from it. Not knowing the movie's plot doesn't necessarily make one ignorant or a lesser person, and in fact, they're far better off if instead of watching the movie, they're out contributing to a food bank or volunteering at a soup kitchen. 

I know I will always be drawn to the conspiracy community for its valuable insights. But the two weeks away from it reinforced that knowledge must be accompanied with action. And sometimes, one does not even need a great deal of conspiracy knowledge to fight the exact problems we all seek to expose here.

I love this community and its posters. The insights shared here equip all of us to be powerful agents of change. I hope we all learn to leverage our knowledge into action--I know I have a long way to go, but my hiatus sharpened my focus on the ""self-improvement"" part. 

I also hope we can become more solutions-oriented around here. I'll do my best to facilitate that as a poster, and I hope this post compels others to at least think about the usefulness in doing the same. ",conspiracy,Podesta

Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that every single person reading this post - every single one of you - was alive when this story became news in 2004.

That fact is intriguing because everyone reading this post has either never heard this story, or forgot about it (I'm betting on the first one, because it is truly unforgettable).

Furthermore, once you hear this story in its entirety, I can promise it will be seared into your memory forever.

Our main character is a man named Marc Dutroux. He was born in Belgium in 1956. He was twice convicted of kidnapping and raping underage children. The first time was in 1989. The second time occurred in 1996.

That was not a typo - you read that correctly. He was convicted and served a (much too brief) sentence in 1998. He served only 3 and a half years of his 13 year sentence because he was released for good behavior. Less than 10 years later, he was arrested again on the same charges (different victims).

In the second round of charges, he was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and abusing victims, some of them to the point of death.

What I am about to tell you comes from the statements made by his surviving victims (called the X Files), Marc Dutreox himself, and evidence from law enforcement. I've also added references/citations at the very end of this post.

Here we go.

Marc confessed to kidnapping, raping, drugging, torturing and filming children for many years. He also claimed he was doing it at the behest of a political elite who financed his career as a professional trafficker.

Not only did this political elite finance his efforts - they made specific requests of him. Sometimes they requested specific types of children (they were called ""party favors"" and he was asked to deliver kids of certain age, sex, race). Sometimes they requested specific means of torturing the children to fulfill their desires (orgies, satanic rituals involving sacrifices, torture games).

And sometimes they requested he film certain influential people engaged in these acts, for later use as blackmail.

He claimed many of his customers and financiers were world leaders. This was not a stretch of the imagination because he lived in Belgium, where the EU and NATO headquarters were located. This statement was also corroborated by victims who were able to identify specific politicians.

Anneke Lucas was one of his victims who testified against him. She claimed she was 6 years old when the cleaning lady hired by her mother sold her to the pedophile network in 1969. Her claims were extraordinary:

-She was raped over seventeen hundred hours before turning 12 years old.
-She was 6 years old when she was forced to participate in her first orgy, which included wearing an iron dog collar and eating human excrement.
-She would actually be delivered back to her parents from time to time. However, her parents themselves were complicit in the crimes and always sent her back to her abusers.
-Torture included being strapped to a butchers block used to execute other children. Other victims were forced to torture her for hours as part of their initiation.
-She was considered attractive and that made her preferred by her abusers. She claimed that she tried to use that to her survival advantage to the best of her ability, but by the age of eleven, she had become so broken that she was slated to be executed and disposed of.
-She said she was saved when one of her abusers negotiated for her freedom. That abuser would later sit as a defendant in the trial.

Other witnesses and victims would soon come forward, describing such things as “Black Masses,” with child and adult sacrifices taking place in front of observers and participants, which included prominent politicians and figures. This would be corroborated by a note found by police at the house belonging to Bernard Weinstein—a man who previously worked with Dutroux, but whom Dutroux had murdered. The letter contained very specific requests for certain types of victims for satanic sacrifices.

The letter was signed by a man who called himself 'Anubis'. It turned out 'Anubis' was the high priest of a satanic cult called 'Abrasax' whose real name was Francis Desmet. Police obtained a warrant and seized computers, documents, mail, actual human skulls, jars of blood, and all sorts of Satanic items - but none of this was enough to make an arrest.

As the Dutroux trial went public, other victims stepped forward and confirmed the testimony, offering up descriptions of sexual abuse and human sacrifice.

They also described “hunting parties” where elites would release naked children into the woods to hide, so that the elites themselves could hunt them down and slaughter them. Many of the stories from victims contained so many similarities, they were impossible to deny. For example, the hunting parties were often held at castles, where victims could not escape and were hidden from the public eye. Those not killed in the hunt were usually chased down and mauled/killed by Dobermans.

All of these victims echoed the testimonies of other, older survivors of ritual Satanic abuse from around the world.

It is also notable that Dutroux owned 10 homes valued at 6 million dollars.

It is also notable that Dutroux was not employed.

It is also notable that Dutroux received $1,200 per month in public assistance.

It is also notable that documents released by Wikileaks show large sums of money in various currencies were deposited into his wife's bank account.

It is also notable that those deposits coincided with reported kidnappings and missing children reports.

It is also notable that before his removal, judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes of sexual torture that took place in Dutroux's dungeon.

It is also notable that 20 potential witnesses for this case have died without explanation.

Does any of this sound familiar?
Are there any headlines today that sound like history is repeating itself?

Guys, not one single thing in this post is theory. It's all proven and on record.

You see the pictures attached to this post? Those are images of hunting games. They're paintings that people like Tony Podesta buy, and hang in his home, and invite others over to enjoy.

We all know Epstein was a sick sob who had friends in high places - the same friends that hang out with Tony Podesta.

You think Epstein was the only one? That he's somehow unique? Or was he the low level one they were willing to sacrifice to protect everyone else involved at a higher level?

Do you realize now that when it comes to trafficking, satanism, pedophilia, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, adrenachrome - that it is art imitating life? That these people who are so obsessed with the art that glorifes these things might actually, themselves, be engaged in these things?

Do you think normal, non-pedo, non-cannibal, average Joes would hang that garbage up in their homes?

Suddenly the claims that world leaders and governments being involved in this satanic horror show isn't so far fetched after all.

Suddenly its not so crazy to say that world agencies who claim to stop these crimes (WHO, UN) are actually facades that cover up the real work of procuring and enabling - yes, even participating - in these crimes.

Suddenly the whole house of cards comes crashing down.

With this one case, all the unbelievers are silenced.

For crying out loud, this trial was in 2004! Did you remember it? If not, do you wonder why it was not front page news across the world?

And if you're asking yourself HOW DO THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THIS - have you not yet figured out that the very people who are supposed to end it, are doing it?

Most everyone has watched an Epstein documentary on Netflix - I think there's been maybe 3 or 4 made since his death. And the one thing I heard people say over and over and over again was this: ""Where is Epstein's girlfriend and why hasn't she been arrested yet?""

Did anyone asking that question even try to find the answer? Or did you just shrug your shoulders and say, ""Well, it is what it is and there's nothing I can do about it"" and go on with your life?

Let me help you out.

Did you hear the news story from two weeks ago that President Trump fired federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman? He was the prosecutor in charge of the Epstein case.

AG Barr requested Berman step down, and Berman refused. So Trump fired him and Berman was replaced with prosecutor Audrey Strauss. And then suddenly BAM! Maxwell is in custody.

You now get a front row seat for the horror show that is about to come out.

You will not believe who is involved and how deep it goes. And you will not believe the lengths they'll go to in order to protect their secrets.

>Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress.

I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.


[Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?](https://spectator.org/the-invisible-awan-brothers-scandal/)

[Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers?

I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. 

Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm). Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511) and knew [Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch) and through [three degrees of separation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/) used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/). If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.






• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?

• The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. 

• The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. 





### The Media
Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.

>With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ) you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath.

Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569).

>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.

This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/transformers/).

This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes...

#[An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House?](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-11/alleged-muslim-spy-ring-why-rex-tillerson-cleaned-house)
>The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet.  Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood “[fifth column” has “infiltrated U.S. Government](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/30/capt-joseph-john-muslim-brotherhood-fifth-column-infiltrated-u-s-government/),” and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration.



 The media is [90% Democrat](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/) and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists?





 










>One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder — why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all?

>Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they can’t sell papers with such a story to tell?














###The Smoking Gun

[EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/exclusive-house-intelligence-it-staffers-fired-in-computer-security-probe/)

>[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html) is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.

>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.

>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.

>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.

Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/). Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. 

[House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/)
>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.


After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers.

>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.



The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/). House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. 

This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. 

Let's state that again...

###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data.

>“At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff,” Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.""





###The Bad Guy


###Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach


The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data.

[House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586)

>Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge.

>More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.


>The former staffer said “Jamal was always there,” but Imran would only work “odd hours.”

And who is investigating this fiasco?

>Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? 


D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the [Congressional members](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586) involved with the Awan Brothers. 

>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.

>""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.

Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. 

The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/) to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. 



>    Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.

>Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/).

Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.

>Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their [TOP SECRET CLEARANCE](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf).

[Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1)
>[frontpagemag](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield) |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.

>The [signatories to the letter](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf) were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.


Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/). Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418) and [Huma Abedin](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556) are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?

[http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/)
>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.

>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.




with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. 





















What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. 

While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. 

I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2 will help you clarify who is who.)


King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)


King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman


Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.


Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.


Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.


Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  


Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.


I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away.


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

Please use this thread to post anything you know about his time in the White House so far, aside from being anti crypto and pushing for more child vaccines has he done anything we aren't aware of?

From yesterday's [dispatch](https://davidseaman.substack.com/p/why-is-a-suspected-child-molester):

**We read their emails, so we know what we’re talking about:** Tony Podesta, obese brother of John Podesta and a man who resembles the 1980s Batman villain “The Penguin” to an almost hilarious extent, was emailing his brother — now a senior advisor at the White House, keep in mind — about how he was feeling so wired and horny sitting next to some children he didn’t know on a flight.

In another email exchange, the Satanic Podestas ask when the next family get together in the “torture chamber” will be.

In yet another email exchange, billionaire Herb Sandler (now deceased) sternly admonishes John Podesta for changing the “operation” for delivery of pizza and cheeses to his home.

The “protocol” for these deliveries had changed without Sandler being notified, and he was surprised and angry.

These folks take their cheese boards pretty goddamn seriously, I mean, jeez.

In yet another bizarre email exchange, John Podesta is notified that the “almost” 6 year old (so, a 5 year old child) will be delivered to his “heated pool” at a farm in the middle of the Virginia woods — at night — for the explicit purpose of “entertainment.”

Knowing that some child abusers are into water breathing restriction, perhaps the public needs more context into why seventy year old billionaire DC lobbyists — who inherited their money from the WWII days — are literally engaged in child trafficking orders, it would appear, to send children to their farm in the woods… which features a heated pool.

The farm isn’t a registered daycare center, nor are the men meeting in the woods caretakers for these children.

If John Podesta had drifted off into retirement, that’d be one thing. As a private citizen, perhaps the unanswered questions still swirling around his emails would fade away.

**But given the fact that proxies for the Podestas are engaged in a vicious deplatforming campaign of many independent journalists just a couple weeks before midterm elections in the US** (we lost our popular TikTok account just the other day to this sad campaign), and given the fact that Podesta is in the White House — advising our President on child vaccine policy, other child health matters, cryptocurrency (when his family is one of the largest holders of the dollar, its competition) — it’s fair and safe to say: we should all take one last look at those emails, to make sure we didn’t get this one wrong.

Are these just a bunch of innocent old men begging each other for time in the torture chamber and more walnut sauce, or is there a monster in the White House?",conspiracy,Podesta

Wikileaks, in case any of us forgot, was the foundation of some of the best resources for conspiracy theories in the last 20 years. 

For a short time in the 2000s/2010s, Assange's work was supported even by the corporate oligopoly known as the entertainment (strickly for liability reasons surely) industry. Until certain files were leaked. Not going to lie, that era is a bit memory-holed. But Rolling Stone used to release decent investigative articles when Matt Taibi was the editor and ran articles on Wikileaks annually. Major magazines like Time and Newsweek likewise covered plenty of WikiLeaks content. 

Things changed around the Bradley Manning release. Bradley is now Chelsea Manning but was Bradly at the time of the leak. Someone associated with Wikileaks got arrested. Assange was holed up in Ecuador for years (while being spied on). From my recollection, Wikileaks publish content sent to them and did not illegally obtain the data. 

Assange was no longer in the news. John McAfee became a pirate and was accused of murder. The US got insanely polarized in 2015-2016. And the Podesta leaks were the last straw with Wikileaks and Assange (Pompeo and the CIA discussed assassinating Assange), News slowly morphed in to clickbait titles and blatant yellow journlaism. Everything from sports to sneakers to brands were politicized. Even if you were apolitical, you would be forced at some point to express a political view. Like buying a coke or wearing Nike was suddenly related to the two party system. 

Nobody filled the gap Wikileaks left. No other major journalist or whistleblower group popped up to take their place. The Snowden leak went over a lot of people's head considering the Patriot Act and CISA courts. It was nearly impossible to find a place to discuss these things, as they required lengthy exchanges and lots of sources. The media rarely covered what Snowden leaked. They absolutely covered his escape to Russia and various other Snowden things. But rarely the content of the leak. 

And that leak happened when most Americans had social media and devices impacted by the ""technology"" Snowden exposed. Basically, everyone with a smartphone or who goes on the internet was impacted by the fact the US gov had advanced spyware.

But no, it was all just Trump in the news. Couldn't discuss anything remotely political without someone making it about Trump. 

The grounds for Assange contesting extradition included arguing the US prison system violates the UN/Geneva Convention human rights standards. And complete crickets in the US despite the fact Assange's extradition case would support a position like no bail and BLM. Why wouldn't the US media want to expose how terrible US prison conditions war after the summer 2020? 

The simplicity of it is Assange published things that upset powerful people and they used their power to destroy and torture him. And that's wrong. He didn't publish lies or dangerous misinformation. He shared mostly government documents where the government actors incriminated themselves. So they are making an example of Assange to show everyone what happens to journalists if they anger the American government, While the US is lecturing everyone about human rights, Assange is rotting in prison because what he published embarrassed/threatened powerful people. That should never be a partisan issue. If a government is committing crimes, the truth needs to be told. Assange wouldn't have had to publish those documents if governments were honest with their citizens. Their lies caused the need to publish the truth. 

Lies are at the root of all evil. And like parasites, they die when they no longer have someone to attach themselves to. Had we rejected lies sooner, Wikileaks would not have needed to exist. If the governments of this world were honest with the people they are supposed to serve, there would be no incriminating leaks because they wouldn't exist. 

So we are all responsible for allowing the Leviathan of Lies to slowly chip away at every aspect of our societies. But once that is acknowledged and we no longer participate in lies, they will cease to exist.",conspiracy,Podesta

My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

You were so out of touch and arrogant in your belief that everyone would vote for your nominee based on the simplified strategy that you weren't Trump.  While Sanders is still out there fighting for a living wage, medicare for all, and tuition free college, you only pop into the media when you feel like blaming someone for your loss, in support of Trump ordering missile strikes, or when you have something to sell.  Don't allow Clinton and establishment Democrats to revise history, we have records of what really happened.

I didn't check DNCleaks 

Everyone was worried about searching for PIZZAGATE and overlooked this. Pizza gate is just a small piece of the BIGGER picture!!! If you use twitter, add on to your hashtags #pizzagate #AlienGate 

Germany was the first country that was interested in Antarctica. Hitler's theory was the earth was hollow and the poles at the end of the earth were the entrance into the center. He said the bloodline elites lived in there (fallen angels or theory is they are reptilian) Hitler was so interested in what was there that he CONTINUED his expedition while WW2 was going on.

There is something there!!!! Julian was trying to tell us by alll the pictures in the leaks. My anon friend said Julian worked out a deal with the CIA and world govts to leak out certain emails to control the minds of the population. If this is true, then Julian would have to communicate with us thru hidden code. So, when searching in WL we need to look for code language. 

First off let me say... Cloning is real, all governments do it. The elites have been pre conditioning us about cloning for a LONG time. 
There's been many cloning movies that give us clues. The freemasonry symbol is identical to the movie Avatar. Which is about cloning humans and aliens
[Avatar and Masonry ](https://sli.mg/xemLLt)

 [Kayne West Cloning music video ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oEBMJOB86pQ) ,

 [Britney Spears Cloning center music video ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFIKP9rGhQ) 

the Simpsons have episode on cloning
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HLITQXRH70M

Here's an example of a Britney Spears clone. Looks nothing like her. She posted this on her twitter. 
 [clone ](https://sli.mg/5eZSU5) 

Here is info from a guy named Don Marshall, he said he's been to the cloning centers and tells all. He can easily be a puppet of the illuminati but he's giving us this info for A REASON. To condition the public...
[don Marshall ](http://donaldmarshallrevolution.com)

George Green was an insider and he tells us about how the elites are cloning and have contact with aliens. 
He said they used to hologram, but now they can clone a walking talking real life person since 2008. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PIKUslVwbs
I think the above two people are puppets but are part of the ""pre conditioning"" the public for what is to come. 

Also, Phillip Schneider worked for the govt building underground bunkers. He said there were 300 + in the US and mentioned Antarctica too. He said the govt budget for this type SHIT is half a trillion. Each bunker cost $17 billion and takes about 2 years to build. The govt averages 3 a year. He also says there is underground railroads the connect all the bunkers which blows the technology we have out of the water. Their technology and roadways make us look ancient. I think this is why trump says our roadways are 3rd world bc he prob knows what type of high tech stuff they have underground. There was a video he posted of the underground bunkers (I think) but it looks like it's been deleted. Phillip also told us there were grey aliens living underground too and he saw them with his own eyes. He said we make deals with them for exchange of tech/energy, so this could be where some of our kids are going. Phillip says 100,000 kids go missing per year, not counted for. Not kidnap but just disappeared.  After he gave this speech he was murdered!!!!

Max spiers is a UFO specialist and researcher. He was also researching the Clinton's as well. Well, he found out too much info and he was murdered too.

Also, you need to remember the Pope met with Patriarch Kirill of Moscow earlier this year, something that hasn't happened in 1000 years, and he told Krill the end is near. At the same time Putin moved The Ark of Gabriel (Has very bad energy) from the middle east  to Antartica. What stuns me about this is, Im reading a book right now called the Islamic Anti-christ. In the  Quran their Messiah is our Anti-christ in our bible. Is the Arc of Gabriel a way to welcome the demons and antichrist on our land?

Ok, Now the mystery of Julian disappearance:
So, if it's true that Julian worked for the CIA and wanted help he would have to send messages to us thru code the hidden code in the wiki misspelled tweets spells out HELP HIM. Why did he send that in code? Bc  someone was watching over him even before he was captured on Oct 17?
. [HELP HIM ](https://sli.mg/DBvByu) 

The US govt been trying to get their hands on Julian for a long time. For what? To maybe clone him? If so they would have to plan this out in great lengths. For years the US has been destroying the Ecuador economy [here ](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Meet-the-Banker-Brothers-Who-Destroyed-Ecuadors-Economy-20160613-0025.html) 
The elites KNOW they get their way if they bribe you. So, they destroy Ecuador economy then bribe Ecuador to give up Julian for cash to rebuild their country. 
The Don Marshall website posted above explains the different types of clones the govt is involved with. He also explains the clones take 5 months to fully grow. I find it really fkin weird that Julian's next appearance is Feb 19. That's 4 months and 3 days after he went missing on Oct. 17 
Could it be possible the US bribed Ecuador in exchange for Julian to clone him?? He is worth more ALIVE bc the public doesn't trust mainstream media. There trust is in WIKILEAKS but majority of the people don't  trust WL without Julian being in charge. WL will fail if Julian is killed. Then the elites won't  have a platform to use to control our minds... MSM fail, WL fail if he's dead. They can't just release him bc he will rebel and run. The elites NEED Julian more then ever especially after Trump won and is threatening to drain the swamp.  They need WL to help spread their propaganda. 

PROOF CIA IS RUNNING WL :One of the WIKILEAKS associates told us NSA and CIA are at war. NSA being the good guys. So, WL the other day RELEASES NSA Germany leaks. Like fkin kidding me? They are fkin stupid. WL is obviously ran by CIA right now bc they are taking jabs at NSA using merkels leaks who is caught throwing up NWO gang signs [here ](https://sli.mg/lHE8wf) 
A lot of people say this 4chan post is fake but I feel like it has some truth to it. That's how CIA works. They feed us truth with dis info. [NSA VS CIA ](https://sli.mg/uwE69h) 

So, having said all that... Its a lot to take in especially with all that has been revealed in the last 3 months. Antartica has to be where the Aliens are located and experiments, such as breeding and cloning etc. go on. In the last 2 years Millionaires are FLOCKING to New Zealand (near Antartica) and underground bunkers are in high demand right now. The elites are preparing for doomsday.

 We recently found out about pizzagate, which is extremely evil and sickening! Its a huge global pedo ring that involves all the world leaders, politicians, bankers, judges, FBI, CIA, and Hollywood and now... Aliens. WTF  This could explain the reason behind kids vanishing. Last week Turkey went nuts blowing up #pizzagate asking where their 9,000 children went. 9,000 refugees were suppose to go to Germany... but they DISAPPEARED! Yeah, put those dots together!! You can't give them cash bc wth they gonna do with it? lol Shit is barley worth anything up here in the real world. 
So, I think we all need to come together and research every end and demand answers:

76,There was a massive amount of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary. We've witnessed the coordinated installation of a nominee against the will of the people.,747.0,6f3t7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6f3t7n/there_was_a_massive_amount_of_election_fraud/,177.0,1496527455.0,"Whether you're a fan of Debbie Lusignan's commentary or not, she put together a very in-depth blog in real-time, state-by-state, chronicling massive amounts of election fraud. Everything's covered;

-Voter Roll Purging (State by state... see Brooklyn alone, where over 125,000 people were seemingly kicked off the rolls. This nationwide phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to potential Sanders voters.)

-Unsolicited Party Affiliation Switching (Lifelong Dems being switched to Lib, Repub, or Independent in closed primaries by the thousands. In one of the more eggregious primaries, AZ, their SOS even testified under oath that this had occured in unprecedented numbers. As above, this phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to Sanders voters.)

-Caucus Rigging (The shenanigans in Iowa and especially NV should have caused more outrage than they did.)

-Absentee Ballot Stuffing (See Wyoming and Montanta for extreme examples of this.)

-Unparalleled Precinct Slashing (This occurred in many states with once again AZ being a prime example. Polling locations were cut to record lows. Lines stretched into the thousands and wait times were documented to be upwards of 4-6 hours in certain counties.)

-Auditing Anomolies (See the results and testimony before the Election Board following the Chicago micro-audit.)

Historic Exit Poll Discrepancies (In 12 states, the discrepancies were well outside of the margin of error and in some cases in the double-digits. These discrepancies were almost entirely exclusive to the Sanders/Clinton race, with everything else matching up within the margin of error as expected. Look at the difference between the exit polls in the Republican Primary versus the Democratic... it's night and day. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that after the exit poll anamolies started to gain serious traction, they were eliminated in each state for the remainder of the primary. Independent exit polls were conducted in the states where official ones were cancelled and often showed massive discrepancies in regards to the official outcome... see CA.)

-Voter Database Breaches (This happened during a few key points pre-primary and during; the AZ breach being the most significant. Though unproven, many election integrity activists theorize that this is the means in which probable Sanders voters were unmasked and targeted for roll purges and affiliation switches.)

-Electronic Voting Machines (Ever since HBO's Hacking Democracy expose aired and bolstered recently by the work of Bev Harris at blackboxvoting dot org, the continued use of electronic voting machines, many of which have been banned in Europe at this point, is highly irresponsible. These machines have proven to be susceptible to remote hacking and provide no paper trail. In fact, there is proprietary software built into the machines themselves with the sole purpose of fractionally weighting the votes to meet a predetermined outcome. See Bev Harris' Fraction Magic mini-doc on youtube to see this exposed in real time. Whether or not this exploitiation was employed is up for debate, but by design this software leaves no evidentiary paper trail, making confirmation one way or the other next to impossible.

Then there is the outright underhandedness. While not necessarily fraud, ethics and fairness do come into serious question.

-Everything in the Wikileaks DNC and Podesta dumps. (This has all been thoroughly covered here.)

-Historically Minimal Debate Schedule (DNC originally only sanctioned 6 debates. Sanders/Clinton ended up having 9, but compare that to 08' when Clinton/Obama faced off 26 times.)

-Near Media Blackout for Sanders during 2015 and into 2016. (In terms of minutes of pre-primary MSN news coverage an estimated 327 minutes went to Trump, 121 minutes to Clinton, and a mere 20 minutes for Sanders despite his surging momentum.)

-Media Bias (To say that the MSM wasn't in the tank for Clinton would be the understatement of the year. See The Washington Compost's 16 hit pieces they ran in one day leading up to Super Tuesday II. Not to mention the media and pundit collusion well documented in the Wikileaks dumps.)

-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held ""open"" primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.

-Super Delegates (The fact that we willfully accept the notion that the vote of indivduals in positions of power count for much more than ours is baffling to me. It's this entirely undemocratic process that saw Clinton walk away with the same amount of pledged delegates as Sanders in a state like Wyoming that healthily won; with SD's included, Clinton walked away from that state, in a losing effort, with an 11 to 7 delegate advantage. Though this ties into media bias, it's worth mentioning that in nearly all MSM coverage, SD's were lumped in with pledged delegates whenever totals were presented to the public, even though SD's didn't cast their votes until the convention. To new and low-information constituents, this deceptive reporting gave the impression that Clinton's lead was always more significant than it actually was; this was done for the seemingly sole purpose of demoralizing the Sanders voting block and stifle upward momentum. As Al Franken pointed out, he felt that due to his political experience he knew what was best for his constituents and would cast his SD vote for Clinton despite his state going for Sanders. Franken was just one of many Reps and Senators that gave the middle finger to the will of their constituency.

-Rallies (Though this is more of a speculative side topic, it can't be ignored. From August 15' through June of 16', even when Sanders had no delegate path to victory, his rallies were attended by hundreds of thousands of indivuals, often filling stadiums to maximum capacity. In contrast, HRC could barely fill a broom closet, let alone a high school gymnasium. Sure, she had a handful of decent turnouts early on, but those number dwindled as the primary carried on, while Sanders' numbers surged in every conceivable way. In one her final rallies in L.A., there were more people protesting outside than HRC supporters inside. Looking at the gross disparity here, something just doesn't pass the smell test.

TL;DR - There was election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary, likely massive, if not an outright coup.

> Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his ""George"" magazine saw celebrity politics coming. The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its time but now looks prescient. George, of course, played the development pretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are dealing with now is dead serious. How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I'm certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.  And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to **produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.** The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.

84,For PizzaGate Skeptics,711.0,5g3ywi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5g3ywi/for_pizzagate_skeptics/,367.0,1480694130.0,"Long post here but I'm earnest in my hope that pizzagate skeptics will give it a read and comment.   There needs to be an actual debate rather than just snarky dismissals.   The media isn't doing its job.   They keep going on about ""conspiracy theorists"" and ""alt-right Trump supporters"" while failing to mention any of the relevant information.   That alone is suspicious to me.     

Please feel free to post this on skeptic boards.   

I really don't want to believe in Pizzagate.   Perhaps you can convince me I shouldn't.   

I think there is too much pedo hysteria in general.   It's tragic that men no longer want to work with children.   Unlike, say, the relative lack of women in STEM (science doesn't care what gender you are) the lack of men in teaching creates real life harm.   Children need both male and female role models, especially at a time when so many mothers are single.   Social scientists are increasingly becoming aware of just how [crucial](http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/dads-play-key-role-in-child-development/) men are to early childhood development.    I'm not sure what the solution is but clearly something needs to be done.   Anyway, long and short is that I'm not remotely interested in spreading false news about pedophilia.   

I don't support either the Democrats or Republicans, so I don't have a dog in this fight.  Actually, from what I gather most Pizzagate researchers believe this to be a bipartisan scandal.   

I also take false accusations very seriously.   It would horrify to me learn that I was engaged in a witch hunt.   I support the Men's Rights Movement's attempts to draw attention to the plight of men falsely accused of sexual crimes.   

One thing we know for certain: there are elite pedo rings currently operating in the United States.   Pedophiles make up at least 4 percent of the population, and billionaires are not excluded from that statistic.   

Another thing we can say with reasonable certainty: high ranking individuals in intelligence agencies are aware of these rings and probably using them for blackmail purposes.    A more horrifying possibility is that pedophiles are deliberately being placed in power because they are compromised.   

**Bad arguments against Pizza Gate**: 

- *It's a ""conspiracy theory"" and can therefore be dismissed.*  Apparently the corporate media thinks this is an actual argument.  It isn't.  

- *Snopes said it isn't true.*   See above.   

- *Pizzagate is made up of alt right Trump supporters who hate Hillary Clinton.*   This is obviously true in some cases, but based on my reading of the Voat forum there are plenty of left wing people involved as well.   

- *if it were true the perps would have been busted.*   Unfortunately past cases involving elite pedo rings, whether the Fraklin Coverup, the Dutroux Affair, Jimmy Saville etc. display a clear pattern of LEO's covering up for the perps.   Why they do this is uncertain.   Some of them may be involved.   Blackmail may be an issue (there is widespread suspicion that elite pedo rings are run by intelligence agencies).   Some LEO's may fear for their lives or those of their families.  

- *There are too many women being singled out for this to be plausible.  Pedophilia is a male thing.*   This is a myth.   Some studies have the percentage of female pedophiles as high as 40%.  

- *Parents and grandparents wouldn't pimp out their own offspring.*   Another myth.   Unfortunately busts of low level pedo rings show people doing exactly that.  

- *Politicians are fine upstanding people.*   I only include this argument because it's a common one for X politician of choice.   ""Trump's a good man!""   ""Obama's a good man!""   These are emotional arguments.   People project their own value systems onto their rulers.   This is unwise, since according to Dr. Robert Hare, the world's leading expert on psychopathy, politicians and business leaders are significantly more likely to be psychopaths than the rest of the population.  

- *We have no witnesses.  Someone would have spoken out.*   Pedo rings are often busted by computer divisions in LE.   Oftentimes none of the children will have said a word.  Pedophiles tend to be quite good at ensuring silence through shame and fear.    This is especially true of powerful pedophiles.   Nor is it outside the realm of possibility that some of these children are being killed.   It's a terrifying thought, but we're talking about people who have no problem killing millions in unnecessary wars of aggression.   

**Coincidences all?**  

I don't necessarily agree with the following arguments but for the sake of narrowing things down I'll pretend as though I do: 

- The pedo symbols on the two businesses next to and across from comet, one of which works with ""at risk youth"", are a coincidence.   

- The night performances usually just involve adults and teens.  

- Sasha Lord working with ""at risk"" girls in juvenile detention is a coincidence. 

- The painting, now removed, of a guy jizzing while playing ping pong with an alien and the words ""Shut up and Fuck"" was inappropriate for an all ages establishment, but these guys are just sex crazed, not pedophiles.   

- Having a sleepover at a pizza restaurant involving both children and adults isn't that unusual (?)  It's a community place.  

- Tony Podesta's art collection, which specializes in images of children, babies, abused children, dead children, cannibalism, pigs, pig-human hybrids, and photographs of naked kids is admittedly bizarre but he just has really strange taste.   

- John Podesta, who has a picture portraying cannibalism in his office, and used to have an image of a butchered pig as his screensaver before colleagues demanded he remove it, views cannibalism as a metaphor.   He's not an actual cannibal (duh).  Also, the fact that he lovingly describes his job during college of butchering pigs may imply that he is a psychopath, but not all psychopaths are pedophiles or cannibals.  

- Marina Abramovic, whose ""art"" revolves around satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism, is just an attention whore.   Shock art is her gimmick.   

- It is a coincidence that the painter Scott G. Brooks, [associated](https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455634) with the Comet crew, paints [pictures](https://theartstack.com/artist/scott-g-brooks/monsters-medicine-2011) of babies and toddlers and half-pig-half human babies and toddlers being tortured, sexually abused, and fed excrement [warning NSFL]

- Tony's close life long friendship with pedophile ""Denny"" Hastert is a coincidence.   There is no evidence that they molested kids when they taught together in Japan.   The ""certain unnamed island"" in Japan that Hastert was allegedly going to ""flee to"" after he was busted probably just referred to a getaway vacation house, not a place where he and Tony molested kids beyond the prying eyes of other teachers.      

- The giant sub-basement Tony created in his home is for art just like he said, not anything sinister. 

- Obama moving two doors down is irrelevant.   No one suspects Obama of anything.  

- The food references in the emails are odd but John is a foodie and especially likes pizza and hotdogs, like Obama.   You'd expect lots of odd food references.   Perhaps they were talking about drugs or escorts.   

- Amanda Kleinman, who performs at Comet and is listed first on their ""friends"" list, is fascinated by pedophilia and likes to joke about pedophilia and reference it in her music videos to provoke people.   Her music video ""Neutered Noel"", which features images of Chuck E cheese, pizza and pizza related images intercut with babies, children, puppies, babies wearing pizza outfits and a baby wearing a ""sugar babies"" outfit intercut with images of rape and sexual torture is an example of this.   

- That woman investigating the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking in Haiti committed suicide because she was depressed.   She was not murdered.   The same is true of all those past associates of Hillary who committed suicide.   Hillary has that effect on people.   

Okay.  So as you can see by my not-so-subtle sarcasm I'm not entirely convinced by all of the above arguments.   However, believe it or not, I'm still willing to entertain the notion that these are all coincides.   I mean, fantastical coincides do happen in life.    

**Here's what I'm having a hard time getting past:** 

- *Jimmy's Instagram*.   This is what got everyone interested, yet the media refuses to even quote Mr. Alefantis in their ""debunking"" articles.   So far the only explanation I've seen from Pizzagate skeptics is that they were all engaging in ""dark humor.""   This doesn't make sense to me.   I have a dark sense of humor.   I've laughed at pedophile jokes.   But these are pictures of real children who are known to the people in question.   It would never occur to me in a million years to make a pedophilic joke if a relative sent me a picture of his child.   Yet here are these people doing it not once but multiple times.   ""Chickenlovers,"" ""Hotard,"" ""Why does daddy like it in the butt,"" ""Gay baby"", Baby for sale -- ""don't touch"", ""Yum…baby"" etc.   I also find the non-sexual comments strangely objectifying.   People not using the children's names but saying things like ""Ginger!"" (red haired baby), ""That's a she baby not a he baby"" etc.   Who the fuck talks like this?   

- *That fucking mole on Tony's forehead.*   The police sketches of the two suspects in the abduction of Maddie McCan do not roughly resemble the Podesta brothers -- they are an exact fit.   Right down to the mole on Tony's forehead.   Long before Pizzagate broke, Maddie's parents were suspected of being complicit in the disappearance/murder.    While it would be absurd to imagine the Podestas creeping around a rich neighborhood abducting kids, their presence would make sense if the parents or someone close to the parents were part of an elite pedo ring.   Apparently they were already into swinging and BDSM.   Perhaps something went wrong during the night's ""entertainment.""   Another ""coincidence"": John deleted his emails the exact date she disappeared.   

- *Tamera Luzzatto referring to ""raw and uncut"" time with a toddler.*   Luzzatto was Hillary's chief of staff.  She and her husband were referred to in an article as the ""real life Underwoods"" from House of Cards, implying a Machiavellian and psychopathic bent.   In one of the emails about a pool party, she refers to three kids as ""entertainment"" and mentions their specific ages.   I was willing to dismiss that as the ravings of an old crazy lady who has a weird way of talking about kids, but I'm having a very difficult time understanding ""raw and uncut"" outside of a sexual context.  

- *Cumulative evidence.*    Any single fact about PizzaGate, if viewed in isolation, would be eyebrow-raising but not enough to suggest anything sinister.   But when all of it is viewed together, it does paint a picture, does it not?   Are people really ""crazy"" for thinking this warrants investigation?

**Edit**: I should also point out that at this point, Pizzagate is no longer just about the Podestas, the Clinton Foundation and Comet Pizza.   People are pursuing a lot of interesting leads.    One of the really disturbing things so far revealed is that an abnormally large number of groups specializing in work with ""at risk"" youth and child trafficking have pedo symbols for their logos and links to sketchy individuals (naturally people are also drawing unwarranted conclusions and seeing stuff that isn't there).   At minimum that should evoke concern.    

**Edit 2**: Two people so far have attempted to refute two of the four points I ended with.   

Re: Luzatto.  The statement reads, ""you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut.""   It has been suggested that she was proud of the baby (described as the ""future ruler of the world"") and was offering to show people ""raw and uncut"" footage of this future leader.   Still sounds weird as hell.   Perhaps she's just gotten a little loopy in her old age?  

Re: Podestas and McCann.  It is claimed that the police sketches are of one person.   Others claim investigators later revised their first impression and believe multiple people were involved.  

**Edit 3**: I should stress that I'm not here to ""prove"" pizzagate.   I was serious when I said I would rather be proven wrong and that I take false accusations very seriously.   If people make compelling arguments I will revise my current position, which is basically *at least some aspects of pizzagate are real.*   

**Edit 4**: Two posters have challenged the ""cumulative evidence"" point.   One suggests that ""autists"" are finding patterns that aren't there.   I think this is definitely true of people who think every symbol or food reference is a tell, but false on the specific points I listed, which do paint a coherent picture.   It is also claimed that people are shocked by the punk rock and gay BDSM scene.   I have found this to be true of some of the youtube Christian posters covering the story, but not for pizzagate researchers in general.   It is specifically the pedophile stuff that people are concerned about, not kinky sex.   

The other poster claimed that the cumulative evidence is largely based on art and innuendo.   I responded with what I think is a relevant point: if the intention of eg Abramovic and Kleinman was to shock people and engender discussion about cannibalism and the torture and rape of children through their art, they have responded to these allegations in a very odd way.   Instead of saying ""I wanted to provoke discussion of X, Y and Z and how pedophilia and child predators affect society etc."" or even just ""I wanted to piss people off"" they have simply claimed that everything is ""fake news"" by Donald Trump supporters.   Alefantis likewise.   

**Edit 5**: One poster suggested that we should stop specifically accusing these people of being pedophiles since there is no hard evidence.   I agree, but I don't see how it would be possible to enforce such a rule.   He also suggested hiring a P.I.  

**Edit 6**: I think this situation would be relatively easy to resolve.   All it requires is...actual journalists.   Ask Tony about his art collection.   Why is he obsessed with pedophilia and images of children being abused?   Ask Tony where he was on the day of McCan's disappeared.   Find out if the Podestas were in Portugal.   Ask Kleinman what she was trying to convey by her music video The Neutered Noel.   Ask Abramovic about the pedophilic photography and what the intent was.   Ask Alefantis about each specific sexual reference in the Instagram photos.  

If there's nothing to see here, and this is nothing more than a witch hunt, why not just clear it up?   If journalists did their jobs then this matter could have been settled weeks ago.   Dismissing everything as fake news and ignoring people's concerns are only adding to the suspicion.

He meant everything to me.

On June 28 2018, I posted a thread on here where I detailed my dad's unexpected and unexplained death within a month of the /r/pizzagate subreddit being shut down. At the time, it was just an inkling in the back of my mind that came up from time to time, and I thought this sub was a safe and openminded place to share - more to just get the crazy thought off my chest than anything. After the thread got some traction, I quickly found myself the subject of numerous rude posts and messages from some other subreddit called /r/topmindsofreddit, ranging from calling me a liar to delusional to disgustingly insulting my dad. I couldn't take it, deleted my entire post history, and tried to move on.

Given recent incidents involving Jeffrey Epstein, I am once again finding myself compelled to share my experience here. I am fully aware that it is completely circumstantial, but I need it to stop eating at me. So take it for what it's worth. At the very least, it's the sad rambling of a broken person missing his dad. 

**Background, credentials, etc:**
If you google my username, you can see references to the original post as well as my status as a former mod for the pizzagate sub. For proof of my career, I am willing to link a few articles to a mod identifying me as a digital forensic professional as well as my dad's obituary, but I really don't want to be doxxed if possible. I especially don't want my dad to be doxxed or defamed. Otherwise, this statement will suffice to convince anyone in the computer forensic field that I am as well: ""FTK beats EnCase because it builds a dtSearch index before you ever run keyword searches. Even though it takes longer to index initially, it's faster in the long run. I hate that little ""AD"" shaped dongle because it's so expensive, but only cheapskates use XWays. Blackbag is better for live-imaging Apple products, and the best way to bitstream image a drive is to physically remove it and use a Tableau TD2 set to dd/raw.""

With that out of the way, I want to talk about my involvement with the sub, the aftermath, and why I'm suspicious.

**My time on /r/pizzagate:**
I want to start out by saying that I initially got caught up in this by pure curiosity. I'm politically liberatarian, and neither side of the aisle really captures my particular worldview. I wasn't the type to push any narrative without evidence, but instead just wanted to see what was going on behind what seemed like an interesting dataset. At the time the Podesta emails had just leaked, and I was fascinated by some of the content because it seemed like possible steganography to me. Specifically, I was intrigued by a series of PowerPoints sent by a Chinese man to Podesta that seemed to contain nothing but photographs of flowers. It just tugged at my inner curiosity - there was no motivation in my initial participation other than that. 

On one of the first nights where the sub was created, I had engaged in a discussion with a handful of users about what steganography was, why certain documents interested me, and also about the importance of staying unbiased and withholding conclusions in any real investigation until all the evidence had been analyzed. I wound up getting a PM from the original user who created the pizzagate sub, who seemed somewhat erratic about his own safety and wanted to bring in other users as mods in case something happened to him. At the time I thought it was a bit of an overreaction, but since I had never been a mod for anything and was interested in digging into the data further I accepted.

Over the next month or so, my activities as a mod included sharing a method for the community to use a TAILS live CD to remain relatively anonymous online, encouraging the validation and replication of all claims (and debunking a few as a result), and sharing a few simple forensic techniques. The community grew dramatically from the initial 50 users or so, but I tried to keep order and keep people focused on the data and using the scientific method to establish any conclusions instead of baseless conjecture. I am pretty sure I was one of the only mods with any real experience in digital investigative work, so I tried to keep the community reigned in especially as it exploded in size.

Even so, I was still treating this largely as a curiosity I didn't take too seriously. I told other members how to keep their IPs hidden, yet I was doing everything from my home computer.

I didn't perceive any real threat, even as conversations drifted to include such topics as Jeffrey Epstein and the similarities between the whole spirit cooking thing and a group called The Finders from the 40s. There was a lot of other speculation at the time, but those come to mind because of their recent relevance. At the time it was all just a curiosity to me. Nobody had started shooting hard drives at pizza restaurants yet - it was all just growing into a giant fascinating web of weird ""performance art"" rituals, human trafficking suspicions, seemingly coded communications, and a lot of other bizarre things that firmly sunk a hook in my mouth. But I never saw any real need to hide my own IP because I was overconfident that this was just a puzzle to work on. 

Here's the thing: I had moved back in with my dad a few years back after a bad breakup and also after he lost his wife. We lived together for a few years until his death. (The TopMinds people seemed to think this is a sign I'm a loser, and I don't care at this point. He was my only family and I loved living with him.)

I have absolutely no social media, and never have. No MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, etc. I barely exist online aside from a few times I've contributed quotes to tech magazines and once in a brief Fox interview about an information security topic. But my dad did, and it was his name on the internet bill. Additionally, he had a long career in the Air Force since Vietnam and worked as a civilian for the DOD until his death. From an outsider's perspective, anything I was doing online could be realistically seen as his actions, even to the point where he had a similar career in the DOD.

**My dad's death:**
I want to start out by saying that I'm aware this could be a natural death. My dad was 66, which makes the chance of a sudden heart attack a possibility, but I also want to note that he was an avid fitness buff. We worked out together three times a week and he ate meticulously healthy, didn't smoke or drink, and had just gotten a checkup two weeks prior to his death where he said that his doctor told him he was in the shape of someone half his age. My dad was exceptionally healthy for his age and had never had a health scare. He did take mild blood thinners (and had done so since his 20s) but his blood pressure was the best it had ever been. 

Fast forward to the first week of 2017. The pizzagate subreddit had been shut down for nearly a month, after some sudden news coverage that painted reddit in a bad light. One night my dad went to bed, said he'd talk to me tomorrow, and that was the last thing he ever said to me. I woke up to banging on the front door the next morning, and was met with the coroner.

My dad was found dead in his truck in the middle of an intersection two blocks from home. There was absolutely no damage to the vehicle - he just stalled out in the middle of the intersection and died.

To say I was instantly destroyed is an understatement. In a second the only friend and family member I had was gone. I couldn't think straight.

The coroner went on to ask me if he had any health problems, etc, and upon receiving a negative asked to see his medication. I mentioned the blood thinners and she immediately interrupted me with ""must have been a heart attack,"" handed me a bag with his phone and watch (no wallet) and a card for a funeral home, told me I had one day to pay $200 to get his truck out of impound, and left.

And there I was, alone in the house, holding the watch I had just bought him for his birthday and a card for the people who had his body.

As time has passed, I've realized there is a lot of seemingly odd stuff associated with his passing. At the time I was so overwhelmed with grief that I couldn't even open my eyes. 

* The coroner personally came to my house. From what I've heard afterward, this is not typical procedure. This was even brought up in the original TopMinds fiasco as ""proof"" I was a liar since ""a coroner would never visit the next of kin."" Her coat said ""coroner,"" her business card said ""coroner,"" and when I looked up a picture of the coroner it was clearly her. No police, just this one person. 

* I was never offered an autopsy or a chance at any further examination (toxicology, etc). 

* The coroner's report seems rushed and misses basic details like the spelling of my dad's name and our address.

* There was not even a cursory investigation of the vehicle. The ""missing wallet"" I described was in the glove box, where he always kept it while driving. I found it myself after getting the truck out of impound. Clearly no search of the vehicle was performed. 

* I examined my dad's phone myself and there were no attempts to call 911 or anybody else. He was alive enough to let out the clutch and start driving through the stop sign, and didn't make it to the end of the intersection. This happened rapidly.

**Final thoughts:**
I don't know why my dad died. Maybe he did just suffer a sudden heart attack with no warning. Maybe I'm just chasing an explanation where none exists. Maybe the timing with the pizzagate subreddit closing was just a coincidence. But it just keeps eating at me and I had to put it out there. 

As a last note of whether some computer forensic guy on a forum would be a valid target, I agree that I'm probably stretching, but I've heard anecdotes from a few other former users that they've experienced bizarre happenings in the same timeframe, including a guy who thought he was being poisoned. These are all anecdotes - many from 4chan and Voat - so I take them with a heavy grain of salt, yet they are hard to ignore. 

Even so, on the notion of my potential impotance or lack thereof, at one point my credentials interested the CIA enough to where I had an interview with them years prior. I had filled out the online application, which informs you that you might receive a call in the following year if they're interested. In 2013ish I did indeed receive that call on a blocked number, telling me I'd be getting a call in a few days from a representative interested in interviewing me, and to wait for the call at 7PM for the next few days. Sure enough, two days later I got a call that lead to a phone interview with an elderly gentleman who identified himself as a former agent. He asked a lot about my take on current events and what books I was reading at the time. I didn't hear back from them after that, so I guess they didn't like my choice of books and my opinions on North Korea, but apparently I had initially interested them enough to lead to that phone interview.

Considering that I was the only person on the mod team for /r/pizzagate with any real world investigative experience, and the credentials I described on there were enough to interest an intelligence agency in an interview years prior, it's maybe not totally unfounded.

Or more likely I'm just looking for some answer I'll never find and connecting dots that aren't there. Even so, it's now off my chest again and I feel better.

I'll probably not be doing a ton of replies this time since I'm sure this will lead to more nasty messages about me and my dad from TopMinds, but whatever. I'll try to reply to any comments when I can. 

Thanks for listening.

Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that every single person reading this post - every single one of you - was alive when this story became news in 2004.

That fact is intriguing because everyone reading this post has either never heard this story, or forgot about it (I'm betting on the first one, because it is truly unforgettable).

Furthermore, once you hear this story in its entirety, I can promise it will be seared into your memory forever.

Our main character is a man named Marc Dutroux. He was born in Belgium in 1956. He was twice convicted of kidnapping and raping underage children. The first time was in 1989. The second time occurred in 1996.

That was not a typo - you read that correctly. He was convicted and served a (much too brief) sentence in 1998. He served only 3 and a half years of his 13 year sentence because he was released for good behavior. Less than 10 years later, he was arrested again on the same charges (different victims).

In the second round of charges, he was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and abusing victims, some of them to the point of death.

What I am about to tell you comes from the statements made by his surviving victims (called the X Files), Marc Dutreox himself, and evidence from law enforcement. I've also added references/citations at the very end of this post.

Here we go.

Marc confessed to kidnapping, raping, drugging, torturing and filming children for many years. He also claimed he was doing it at the behest of a political elite who financed his career as a professional trafficker.

Not only did this political elite finance his efforts - they made specific requests of him. Sometimes they requested specific types of children (they were called ""party favors"" and he was asked to deliver kids of certain age, sex, race). Sometimes they requested specific means of torturing the children to fulfill their desires (orgies, satanic rituals involving sacrifices, torture games).

And sometimes they requested he film certain influential people engaged in these acts, for later use as blackmail.

He claimed many of his customers and financiers were world leaders. This was not a stretch of the imagination because he lived in Belgium, where the EU and NATO headquarters were located. This statement was also corroborated by victims who were able to identify specific politicians.

Anneke Lucas was one of his victims who testified against him. She claimed she was 6 years old when the cleaning lady hired by her mother sold her to the pedophile network in 1969. Her claims were extraordinary:

-She was raped over seventeen hundred hours before turning 12 years old. -She was 6 years old when she was forced to participate in her first orgy, which included wearing an iron dog collar and eating human excrement. -She would actually be delivered back to her parents from time to time. However, her parents themselves were complicit in the crimes and always sent her back to her abusers. -Torture included being strapped to a butchers block used to execute other children. Other victims were forced to torture her for hours as part of their initiation. -She was considered attractive and that made her preferred by her abusers. She claimed that she tried to use that to her survival advantage to the best of her ability, but by the age of eleven, she had become so broken that she was slated to be executed and disposed of. -She said she was saved when one of her abusers negotiated for her freedom. That abuser would later sit as a defendant in the trial.

Other witnesses and victims would soon come forward, describing such things as “Black Masses,” with child and adult sacrifices taking place in front of observers and participants, which included prominent politicians and figures. This would be corroborated by a note found by police at the house belonging to Bernard Weinstein—a man who previously worked with Dutroux, but whom Dutroux had murdered. The letter contained very specific requests for certain types of victims for satanic sacrifices.

The letter was signed by a man who called himself 'Anubis'. It turned out 'Anubis' was the high priest of a satanic cult called 'Abrasax' whose real name was Francis Desmet. Police obtained a warrant and seized computers, documents, mail, actual human skulls, jars of blood, and all sorts of Satanic items - but none of this was enough to make an arrest.

As the Dutroux trial went public, other victims stepped forward and confirmed the testimony, offering up descriptions of sexual abuse and human sacrifice.

They also described “hunting parties” where elites would release naked children into the woods to hide, so that the elites themselves could hunt them down and slaughter them. Many of the stories from victims contained so many similarities, they were impossible to deny. For example, the hunting parties were often held at castles, where victims could not escape and were hidden from the public eye. Those not killed in the hunt were usually chased down and mauled/killed by Dobermans.

All of these victims echoed the testimonies of other, older survivors of ritual Satanic abuse from around the world.

It is also notable that Dutroux owned 10 homes valued at 6 million dollars.

It is also notable that Dutroux was not employed.

It is also notable that Dutroux received $1,200 per month in public assistance.

It is also notable that documents released by Wikileaks show large sums of money in various currencies were deposited into his wife's bank account.

It is also notable that those deposits coincided with reported kidnappings and missing children reports.

It is also notable that before his removal, judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes of sexual torture that took place in Dutroux's dungeon.

It is also notable that 20 potential witnesses for this case have died without explanation.

Does any of this sound familiar? Are there any headlines today that sound like history is repeating itself?

Guys, not one single thing in this post is theory. It's all proven and on record.

You see the pictures attached to this post? Those are images of hunting games. They're paintings that people like Tony Podesta buy, and hang in his home, and invite others over to enjoy.

We all know Epstein was a sick sob who had friends in high places - the same friends that hang out with Tony Podesta.

You think Epstein was the only one? That he's somehow unique? Or was he the low level one they were willing to sacrifice to protect everyone else involved at a higher level?

Do you realize now that when it comes to trafficking, satanism, pedophilia, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, adrenachrome - that it is art imitating life? That these people who are so obsessed with the art that glorifes these things might actually, themselves, be engaged in these things?

Do you think normal, non-pedo, non-cannibal, average Joes would hang that garbage up in their homes?

Suddenly the claims that world leaders and governments being involved in this satanic horror show isn't so far fetched after all.

Suddenly its not so crazy to say that world agencies who claim to stop these crimes (WHO, UN) are actually facades that cover up the real work of procuring and enabling - yes, even participating - in these crimes.

Suddenly the whole house of cards comes crashing down.

With this one case, all the unbelievers are silenced.

For crying out loud, this trial was in 2004! Did you remember it? If not, do you wonder why it was not front page news across the world?

And if you're asking yourself HOW DO THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THIS - have you not yet figured out that the very people who are supposed to end it, are doing it?

Most everyone has watched an Epstein documentary on Netflix - I think there's been maybe 3 or 4 made since his death. And the one thing I heard people say over and over and over again was this: ""Where is Epstein's girlfriend and why hasn't she been arrested yet?""

Did anyone asking that question even try to find the answer? Or did you just shrug your shoulders and say, ""Well, it is what it is and there's nothing I can do about it"" and go on with your life?

Let me help you out.

Did you hear the news story from two weeks ago that President Trump fired federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman? He was the prosecutor in charge of the Epstein case.

AG Barr requested Berman step down, and Berman refused. So Trump fired him and Berman was replaced with prosecutor Audrey Strauss. And then suddenly BAM! Maxwell is in custody.

You now get a front row seat for the horror show that is about to come out.

You will not believe who is involved and how deep it goes. And you will not believe the lengths they'll go to in order to protect their secrets.

Naturally, this raised a few questions amongst the ""conspiracy community"". 

**I'd Like to point out that there was a subreddit dedicated specifically to Pizzagate in the early days, several months ago. That sub was deleted and banned by mods, which many believed to be a BLATANT example of censorship.**

**Fearing yet another witchunt, Reddit bans Pizzagate sub**


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/


Following the ban, one of the earliest examples of media distortion/intervention regarding the subject of John Podesta's emails was the invention of the term ""fake news"".

The timing of the creation of this new Orwellian term, ""fake news"" seemed all too  coincidental with the Pizzagate revelations of John Podesta's Emails. 


After the investigation began to pick up steam, the MSM and social engineers agreed this could no longer be ignored, it had passed the threshold and had to be addressed with propaganda to distort the public's view. 

**Stephen Colbert's Hit Piece on PG pushing the new ""Fake News"" term, discrediting the investigation** 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y


This was unprecedented ^. Many of us were in shock when we saw this. However, this is merely one example of the great lengths TPTB would go to to try and bury this investigation..

Next, Snopes had released their article on the ""conspiracy theory"", somehow debunking it, and also branding it as fake news. 

http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/

And who else but our beloved Wikipedia, to release a write up on Pizzagate, also referring to it as fake news and calling it ""Debunked"", whilst distorting several of the fundamental facts.

**NOTE: the term Debunked has never been used or associated with a conspiracy until Pizzagate. There was a clear, coordinated effort to discredit this investigation, and the desperation to use the term ""debunked"" was unprecedented until then.**

Surprise, **A gunman storms into the suspected pedophile trafficking business with a gun, branding the issue as a ""violent witch hunt"" and ""politically motivated""**

https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/



After successfully branding the investigation as a conservative hate-hunt, the social engineers (ever so nervous), had decided it's time a major news network address this issue. So, our dear friend at FOX news and Megyn Kelly decided to set the record straight for us, with an appearance from Comet Ping Pong owner himself, James Alefantis. The interview focused on the ""detrimental effects of fake news"", and how small businesses can be affected by fake stories.

**(NOTE: Many of us believe the shooting to be a staged false flag attack. The topic simply picked up too much steam, and they had to demonize the investigators as ""Radical alt-Right)""**

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG3k2Bv0jrI

At this point, TPTB are feeling pretty secure. They have:

1. **Declared it a ""conspiracy""**

2. **Branded fake news**

3. **Painted Pizzagate as a politically motivated movement against the left**


At this point, all they have to do is wait. They hope that time will eventually bury the issue and it will be just a mere memory. 

However, with the amount of circumstantial evidence that has been archived on the Internet, there is enough to put these people away forever.

**This is a coordinated and focused effort to discredit us. Keep talking about this stuff, keep sharing, keep it alive. The fact that they are going through this amount of money, resources, and effort to silence is. Is only validating our cause. Good speed gents.**

PS: David Brock, there is a special place in hell for you, you two faced fuck.

I truly believe that this letter from his lawyer is one of the biggest legal/political gaffes I've ever seen. His lawyer has issued an official letter clearly stating that John Podesta was fully in his legal right to move his shares with this Kremlin connected company so that he wouldn't have to report to the Obama White House that he had them. Read the letter, that's what his lawyer is arguing very strongly. I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

He's eventually intimidated into ceasing his investigation. 

The secret society of the upper class is shown to have creepy sex-based rituals, with elements that seem to be modified from Christianity, like a bastardization of it. Here it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvYfMsKJhE

The creepy part, though, is the old conspiracy theory that Kubrick was killed because of this movie. People believe he was a central figure in the Illuminati (he seems to be the most respected one in all Hollywood, despite not being a hitmaker like Spielberg). The theory asserts that the above ritual and other behaviors shown by the upper class in the film are based upon true behaviors of those people, and a real secret society of theirs. 

I never believed it, because I didn't believe in a secret ruling class secret society, I thought it was dumb tbh. Plus, he was over 70, and the official cause of death is a heart attack while he slept. Seems likely. I figured it was just art for art's sake, while being an interesting look at society's financial heirarchy. That changed with the Podesta emails.

What the Podesta emails possibly show is that the theory IS true. The upper class DOES hold secret, ritualistic meetings, (we know for sure that they attend Spirit Cooking rituals now) and the links people are bringing up are revealing all this crazy stuff about ritualistic, masonic, satanist sex rituals, largely involving children and sacrifice, as well as cannibalism. 

We still don't know for SURE what's true and what's not, but Eyes Wide Shut fits WAY too well into this theory with all of this other stuff coming out.

He confirms WikiLeaks has not been compromised. Julian took questions from the Reddit AmA but answered them via live, current and interactive video. He did this very intentionally, and by so doing, was true to his word. Watch a recording of the live event here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2EjKYMCeg

---------------------------------

On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry (self admitted Skull and Bones member) visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.

For over four years, the Ecuadorian embassy has been under surveillance and Julian's human rights violated as he has been unlawfully detained termed ""illegal arbitrary detention"" by a recent UN ruling. During that time, it has been possible for intelligence agencies to gather critical information and build a detailed profile and plan to circumvent Julian's dead man's switch.

Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies know perfectly well that cutting off Julian's internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that are damaging to Hillary's campaign. It has been very clear for a long time that
many US officials wanted Julian Assange dead, Hillary Clinton even has remarked, ""can't we just drone the guy"". 

The cutting off of Julian's internet access was not for the purpose of preventing the leaks of the Podesta and Hillary emails. Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they know that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also know WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian's ability to communicate.

Removing Assange would not be enough, they would need to circumvent his dead man's switch and then tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Removing Assange's internet could have the effect of causing Assange
to take steps that can be followed to prevent the automatic triggering of his DMS. 

From the day Julian's internet was cut off, a series of peculiar and uncharacteristic events started to take place. The same day that Julian's internet was cut off, CBS reported that Pamela Anderson visited Assange and had ""Tortured"" him with a vegan sandwich. A few days before on the 14th, John Podesta tweeted ""I bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy"". Then on October the 16th the SHA-256 prerelease keys were issued on WikiLeaks twitter feed, although these events are odd and seemingly inconsequential, combined with John Kerry being in the UK from the 16th to the 17th sparked concern among the community for Julian's safety.

Assange supporters started to gather at the embassy to keep Assange safe and witness any foul play, some of these witnesses have claimed that a very swift police armed raid took place that lasted only 5 minutes while the crowd was kept under control and prevented from approaching, there have also been reports that they were prevented from taking photographs and that their phones were confiscated. A live periscope feed was also cut off. There have also been some reports of the presence of a mobile jamming van.

If Assange has been seized, any recognition by mainstream media would be detrimental to Hillary's campaign. A covert operation with media blackout would be the only effective way of seizing him at this time. On October the 18th Fox News said that Julian Assange would be ""arrested soon, maybe in a matter of hours."". The was video was then promptly removed and articles relating to it have disappeared. However, one reddit user was able to find an alternative source and now the video can be found again on YouTube.

Although Julian's primary DMS (the release of insurance file encryption keys) did not activate, on October the 18th one of Julian's contingencies did activate, a script was activated that made https://file.wikileaks.org/file publicly visible and set all the file date and time stamps to 01/01/1984 (Orwell reference). This file repository contains many documents that had not been released prior. 


Staffers Kristinn Hrafnsson and Sarah Harrison, have gone silent while the Ecuadorian embassy is refusing to provide any updates on Assange’s fate. There is a recorded call made to the embassy by a journalist where the receptionist refused to confirm that Julian was at the embassy, she also refused to confirm that Julian was even alive. Julian has not made an appearance at the window of the embassy since being cut off.

WikiLeaks suggested in a tweet that its supporters were responsible for the DDOS attacks on the 21st. Neither Assange or WikiLeaks would ever insinuate such a thing. WikiLeaks deceptively tweeted a video of Michael Moore that was actually recorded in June. The video was posted on the 24th of October giving the impression that Michael Moore had been speaking with Assange in the embassy. Why would WikiLeaks do this when they know they are already under suspicion?

WikiLeaks have been using their Twitter account to give the appearance of his safety while providing no concrete evidence of his safety. They issued a poll asking what proof would satisfy the public that Julian was safe. WikiLeaks have yet to follow up on the conclusive result of a video or window appearance.

Julian Assange is known for his attention to detail and his consistently good spelling and grammar. Currently the twitter feed has very poor spelling, there are numerous uncharacteristic spelling errors, for example, an accomplished cryptographer knows how to correctly spell algorithm and so do WikiLeaks staff.

On the 21st of October, there was a massive widespread DDOS attack that disrupted US and EU internet. Also on the 21st of October London City Airport was evacuated. The next day (the 22nd), Gavin MacFayden is reported dead. WikiLeaks made a further blunder by stating his death as the 23rd.

There has been a number of high level WikiLeaks deaths recently too. John Jones QC - WikiLeaks U.N. lawyer died on April 16th 2016. Michael Ratner - WikiLeaks chief counsel died on May 11th 2016. Seth Rich - Employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was fatally shot on July 10th 2016 and Gavin MacFadyen - WikiLeaks director died October 22nd 2016.

If WikiLeaks has been compromised, it is already preparing the scene for future discrepancy to seriously tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Nothing WikiLeaks has shared since the 15th of October 2016 should be trusted until Julian has been fully verified as alive.

My speculative fears are that Julian has been seized and removed from the Embassy. His internet being cut not being related to the release of the emails, but rather as a component of a plan of 4 years in the making to as secretly as possible remove Assange from the embassy, circumvent his DMS and hijack WikiLeaks with the key team members silenced or under duress.

My fears would be confirmed by no future public (mass witnessing and recorded/televised) appearance of Julian Assange discussing recent topics. His death by whatever means after the US presidential election would be extremely suspect. Until proof of life, assume the following compromised:

SHA-256 verification Keys posted after the 15th. 
WikiLeaks submission process and/or platform.
WikiLeaks twitter feed.
Any WikiLeaks leaks after the 15th October 2016.

1) Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks.
2) RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)
3) Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised
4) The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files
5) Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning. No one actually saw Julian through the whole process.

Additional points:

-UK disregard for international law
-Capabilities of combined intelligence agencies
-WikiLeaks down on October 17th
-Mass censorship
-WikiLeaks reposting old stuff

[Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks]
Watch this https://youtu.be/GSIDS_lvRv4 video for a simple and good explanation of public/private key cryptography. Here https://riseup.net/en/canary is an example of how a legitimate cryptographically capable organisation uses PGP to sign a message and prove authenticity. WikiLeaks has this setup too. Why do they not use it and prove they are not compromised?

WikiLeaks could easily do this. They have their private key. The public has WikiLeaks public key. Even if Julian isn’t in possession of the key, WL most certainly is, no excuse for WL not to prove themselves. This has been heavily requested of WikiLeaks. I’d like to hear from the individuals who claim that their requests were removed (please leave comments). Of all the red flags, not posting a PGP signed message is by far the most damming.
If we are to believe that the person in the audio recording at the FCM 2016 is Julian Assange, then what he says about the keys is missing the point. If he himself is not in possession of the key, then WikiLeaks will be. If WikiLeaks use the key to prove themselves, then we know they are not compromised. By extension, we will also be assured that Julian is safe as an uncompromised WikiLeaks would be in a position to confirm his safety and be believed. This audio file includes everything that he says regarding PGP keys: http://picosong.com/UyVw/ (I am not convinced this is Julian).

[RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)]
RiseUp is an activist ISP providing secure services to activists. Its mission is to support liberatory social change via fighting social control and mass surveillance through distribution of secure tools (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseup).
RiseUp use a warrant canary as a means to protect their users in case RiseUp are ever issued with a NSL or gag order etc (https://riseup.net/en/canary). This is renewed quarterly, assuming no warrant has been issued. However, this is now considerably overdue so the assumption is that the canary is dead, and just like the canaries used in coal mines, everyone should get the hell out of there when it dies. https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/something-happened-to-activist-email-provider-riseup-but-it-hasnt-been-compromised/. I would be grateful if someone could provide a source for the WikiLeaks twitter email account being hosted by RiseUp.

[Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised]
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088 https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788099178832420865 On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian Embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.

Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies knew perfectly well that cutting off Julian's internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that were damaging to Hillary's campaign.

Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they knew that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also knew WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian's ability to communicate.

Now it is long after the election and Ecuador have still not restored Julian’s internet. Ecuador have no grounds to continue to restrict Julian’s internet. It does nothing apart from increase tensions and raise suspicion.
Ecuador have always been supportive of Julian. However, after John Kerry applied pressure on Ecuador, that whole dynamic changed. Ecuador cut Julian's Internet. He then essentially threatened Ecuador, the UK and John Kerry by submitting those pre-commitment file hashes on Twitter. Since then we have only seen hostility towards Julian from all three parties. Ecuador didn't restore his internet and didn't let his lawyer interview him and no one actually saw him. The U.K. Denied him access to Gavin's funeral and denied him access to medical treatment. The UK also continually disregard the UN. The dynamic now is totally different. He has no political friends. It seems that both the UK and Ecuador are now working against Julian and Wikileaks. An environment where a collaborated siege would be feasible.

Finally, many have speculated about mobile signals being blocked at the Embassy. I can confirm that there is 4G signal right outside the Embassy door. I was there, with my phone, and tested it. There is no reason to think Julian cannot use a MiFi device (or similar) connected to a cellular network.

[The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files]
Here are the October tweets with the file hashes:

https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781046519693316
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781519951720449

These 3 pre-commitment Twitter posts are SHA-256 file hashes. SHA-256 file hashes are 64 characters long. They are not encryption keys for insurance files. They simply are a mathematical formula for verifying that later released files are genuine and have not been altered.

These hashes were released because Julian felt threatened and in increased danger. They specifically targeted the UK FCO, Ecuador and John Kerry. All of whom are key players in his current predicament.
On November 7th, WikiLeaks released 3 new insurance files. These files names match the names given in the pre-commitment hash tweets:

2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_EC.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_UK.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_US.aes256

EC = Ecuador, UK = UK FCO, US = John Kerry. Soon after these files were released, the 3 files hashes were compared to the 3 hashes posted on the 16th of October. They did not match. When this was brought to WikiLeaks attention, WikiLeaks released the following statement in a tweet:
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521

“NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.”

This firstly proved that the hashes and the insurance files were related (a fact that was already clear). Secondly, it was a lie, as it implied historical use of pre-commitment hashes in this manner. Thirdly, the (obviously) comment was also a deception and an insult to supporters. It was not obvious to anyone, not even to our crypto guys in /r/cryptography/, on the contrary, they thought it highly suspicious.
Additionally, what they suggest would be absolutely pointless. Pointless as a threat, as the UK, Ecuador and John Kerry would have no practical way of identifying the documents to confirm the threat.
There's absolutely no scenario where an uncompromised WikiLeaks would either post bad file hashes or altered insurance files.

[Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning]
This is highly unusual and very suspicious. Also, Jennifer Robinson was not in the room with Assange. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&feature=youtu.be&t=9m55s and neither was the chief prosecutor http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37972528 “Swedish chief prosecutor Ingrid Isgren will not speak to Mr Assange directly”.

[UK disregard for international law]
The UK threat is very real. Back in August 2012 the UK was poised to break international law citing the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act of 1987 as a basis for entering the Embassy and arresting Assange (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19259623). It all became very public, very quickly and fortunately never happened (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/ecuador/9488996/Ecuadors-president-raiding-embassy-to-snatch-Julian-Assange-suicidal.html). I expressed my concern at the time that the UK shouldn’t have even been contemplating such action, let alone threatening it in writing to Ecuador.
More recently, the UK disregarded the UN ruling that Julian Assange was being arbitrarily detained (https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/julian-assange-wikileaks-arrest-friday-un-investigation). The UK appealed, and then finally lost their appeal in November (https://www.rt.com/news/368746-un-ruling-free-assange/). Julian has also been refused to leave the Embassy with a police escort for medical treatment as well as denied to attend Gavin MacFadyen’s funeral. The UK’s behaviour is appalling and clearly has no respect for international law. The reported raid on the Embassy during the latter part of October seems more plausible when taken in the context of past behavior.

This is the Britain I now live in: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html. I never used to be ashamed to be British.

[Combined capabilities of intelligence agencies]
We know much about the combined powers of the intelligence agencies. We know what they are capable of, thanks to the leaks of Edward Snowden. The combined powers of the NSA, CIA and the UK’s GCHQ are capable of pulling off such a massive takeover of Wikileaks. We know the NSA works with other US intelligence agencies, we know that the NSA works with GCHQ.

We know about Tempora, we know about JTRIG, we know about PRISM, we know about HAVOK. We know that websites can be altered on the fly, we know that real-time voice profiling is trivial for these agencies. We know that censorship is happening.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)

The NSA has a remit to be 10 years ahead of the curve. We have commercial products that can be purchased off the shelf today that can easily manipulate audio and video. Just imagine what the NSA and the military are capable of.

Real time facial manipulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk Signs of editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O9t_TEE1aw. Both Julian Assange and John Pilger are not filmed together at any time during the interview. There is also no establishing shot. It is also claimed that Assange’s audio is spliced and edited. No recent events mentioned by Assange, only Pilger. Unfortunately, this interview is not sufficient proof of life.

What the NSA can’t do, is that they cannot break PGP encryption. This has been expressed by Glenn Greenwald who was one of the journalists that Edward Snowden leaked to. He commented that he knows how secure PGP is because the NSA keep moaning about not being able to crack it in their documents he is reading. This is another reason why a signed PGP message can be the only true proof that WL isn’t compromised. Mathematics cannot lie, people can and do. A compromised WL can’t sign a message without the private key.
Edward Snowden revealed that in 2013 the NSA were capable of 3 trillion password attempts per second. As it is now almost 2017, that number will likely be multiple times higher (anywhere between 9 to 15 trillion attempts per second would be my guess based on Moore’s law).

[WikiLeaks down on October 17th]
The alleged raid on the Embassy supposedly took place on the 17th just after 1am GMT. On Monday the 17th of October 2016 WikiLeaks website was reported down (http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/wikileaks.org.html expand the comments) https://postimg.org/image/6t68fe4kj/. The internet was alive with reports of mass censorship around this time. This all coincides with when the alleged WikiLeaks takeover occurred. It also coincides with John Kerry being in the UK.

[Christine Assange audio only radio interview] Julian's family had their identities changed quite a few years ago after receiving death threats. It is odd that his mother has now revealed herself to a news agency. If you do a YouTube search for Christine Assange (her original name), you'll find all the videos are older than 3 years. She's in hiding, not openly talking on radio shows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange scroll down to the personal life section).

[WikiLeaks bitcoin account was emptied on the 18th of November] Interestingly it was after the bitcoin account was emptied that the encoded message in the blockchain was left. Why would WikiLeaks go to all that trouble when they could just sign a message with their PGP key? Is it because bitcoin accounts can be cracked and the PGP keys can’t?

[Mass censorship] Facebook is censoring this event (https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/). It has been advertised for weeks now any only a handful of people are attending. Recently Wikileaks was live on FB. 50% of the viewers (roughly 2.5k) were commenting #PoL, #Whereisassange, RIP etc. The live event was only a prerecorded video being played in loop. Once it concluded, the whole Live event along with all the comments including the comments asking for PoL and PGP signed message were deleted. It was as if it never took place.
When Julian’s DMS had supposedly been activated, I saw posts in threads being deleted within minutes. Supposedly with encryption keys, but it all happened too fast for anyone to collate. I took PDF printouts of the pages and then later noticed that posts and entire links were taken down. I have PDF's of pages that now no longer exist. I've been following this since mid-October and seen the censorship first hand. I know many people here on reddit witnessed the same (please comment with your experiences).

[WikiLeaks reposting old stuff]
There are many examples of this already mentioned in the timelines. One for example is the Palantir Technologies report. Palantir Technologies prepared a report on how to destroy WikiLeaks that was leaked in 2011. The proposal was submitted to Bank of America through its outside law firm, Hunton & Williams. Palantir later apologised for their involvement. But WikiLeaks has recently regurgitated it as if it was new. There are many examples of this. I have watched as WikiLeaks have increasingly destroyed their credibility.",conspiracy,Podesta

I would think the kind of people who frequent a conspiracy sub would be relatively open to questioning the official mainstream media narrative. The skeptics are literally echoing MSM talking points, and you're on a conspiracy forum, where **NOBODY here trusts the media. You are not only wasting your breath and your own time by relaying their narrative here and slapping down the legitimate questions we have, but you guys look ignorant for pushing that stuff here.**

It's pretty funny actually, think about what you are doing. You're literally coming onto a conspiracy sub, discouraging an independent investigation and protecting the Elite who are implicated using mainstream media talking points as your rationale. Thats the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life, you are going to get nowhere. It's a fucking conspiracy sub! Everybody here hates and distrusts the elite and the media, and you're on here essentially protecting them and telling us we shouldn't bother looking into this. Ha! Thats classic!

I have never seen a ""conspiracy"" so aggressively attacked. Especially one that is actually backed by mountains of circumstantial evidence, that no rational person could overlook. Ignoring even the slightest chance that these kids could be in danger is stupid and selfish. The shills are going to try and split this board up over this issue, and divide us. We need to unite under this issue. I can tell you right now that millions of people all over the world are taking Pizzagate and the content in Podesta's emails seriously. You guys are smart enough to see that they are covering their tracks, deleting twiter posts and instagram photos, and the media is launching a fucking onslaught of ""fake news"" attacks, they likely staged a false flag gunman to demonize our investigation, and now they're trying to de-legitimize Podesta's emails with this new Russia narrative. They are blatantly scared. If you are still denying pizzagate, than you simply do not possess the ability to see the big picture in your head. The majority of people on this board are able to, we encourage a questioning attitude and we have an innate distrust of authority, we don't attack or try to embarrass others for looking into something as you are doing.

Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that every single person reading this post - every single one of you - was alive when this story became news in 2004.

That fact is intriguing because everyone reading this post has either never heard this story, or forgot about it (I'm betting on the first one, because it is truly unforgettable).

Furthermore, once you hear this story in its entirety, I can promise it will be seared into your memory forever.

Our main character is a man named Marc Dutroux. He was born in Belgium in 1956. He was twice convicted of kidnapping and raping underage children. The first time was in 1989. The second time occurred in 1996.

That was not a typo - you read that correctly. He was convicted and served a (much too brief) sentence in 1998. He served only 3 and a half years of his 13 year sentence because he was released for good behavior. Less than 10 years later, he was arrested again on the same charges (different victims).

In the second round of charges, he was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and abusing victims, some of them to the point of death.

What I am about to tell you comes from the statements made by his surviving victims (called the X Files), Marc Dutreox himself, and evidence from law enforcement.

Here we go.

Marc confessed to kidnapping, raping, drugging, torturing and filming children for many years. He also claimed he was doing it at the behest of a political elite who financed his career as a professional trafficker.

Not only did this political elite finance his efforts - they made specific requests of him. Sometimes they requested specific types of children (they were called ""party favors"" and he was asked to deliver kids of certain age, sex, race). Sometimes they requested specific means of torturing the children to fulfill their desires (orgies, satanic rituals involving sacrifices, torture games).

And sometimes they requested he film certain influential people engaged in these acts, for later use as blackmail.

He claimed many of his customers and financiers were world leaders. This was not a stretch of the imagination because he lived in Belgium, where the EU and NATO headquarters were located. This statement was also corroborated by victims who were able to identify specific politicians.

Anneke Lucas was one of his victims who testified against him. She claimed she was 6 years old when the cleaning lady hired by her mother sold her to the pedophile network in 1969. Her claims were extraordinary:

-She was raped over seventeen hundred hours before turning 12 years old.
-She was 6 years old when she was forced to participate in her first orgy, which included wearing an iron dog collar and eating human excrement.
-She would actually be delivered back to her parents from time to time. However, her parents themselves were complicit in the crimes and always sent her back to her abusers.
-Torture included being strapped to a butchers block used to execute other children. Other victims were forced to torture her for hours as part of their initiation.
-She was considered attractive and that made her preferred by her abusers. She claimed that she tried to use that to her survival advantage to the best of her ability, but by the age of eleven, she had become so broken that she was slated to be executed and disposed of.
-She said she was saved when one of her abusers negotiated for her freedom. That abuser would later sit as a defendant in the trial.

Other witnesses and victims would soon come forward, describing such things as “Black Masses,” with child and adult sacrifices taking place in front of observers and participants, which included prominent politicians and figures. This would be corroborated by a note found by police at the house belonging to Bernard Weinstein—a man who previously worked with Dutroux, but whom Dutroux had murdered. The letter contained very specific requests for certain types of victims for satanic sacrifices.

The letter was signed by a man who called himself 'Anubis'. It turned out 'Anubis' was the high priest of a satanic cult called 'Abrasax' whose real name was Francis Desmet. Police obtained a warrant and seized computers, documents, mail, actual human skulls, jars of blood, and all sorts of Satanic items - but none of this was enough to make an arrest.

As the Dutroux trial went public, other victims stepped forward and confirmed the testimony, offering up descriptions of sexual abuse and human sacrifice.

They also described “hunting parties” where elites would release naked children into the woods to hide, so that the elites themselves could hunt them down and slaughter them. Many of the stories from victims contained so many similarities, they were impossible to deny. For example, the hunting parties were often held at castles, where victims could not escape and were hidden from the public eye. Those not killed in the hunt were usually chased down and mauled/killed by Dobermans.

All of these victims echoed the testimonies of other, older survivors of ritual Satanic abuse from around the world.

It is also notable that Dutroux owned 10 homes valued at 6 million dollars.

It is also notable that Dutroux was not employed.

It is also notable that Dutroux received $1,200 per month in public assistance.

It is also notable that documents released by Wikileaks show large sums of money in various currencies were deposited into his wife's bank account.

It is also notable that those deposits coincided with reported kidnappings and missing children reports.

It is also notable that before his removal, judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes of sexual torture that took place in Dutroux's dungeon.

It is also notable that 20 potential witnesses for this case have died without explanation.

Does any of this sound familiar?
Are there any headlines today that sound like history is repeating itself?

Guys, not one single thing in this post is theory. It's all proven and on record.

There are images of  these “hunting games” They're paintings that people like Tony Podesta buy, and hang in his home, and invite others over to enjoy. Pictures of young girls running through woods with cuts on them and often red shoes. 

We all know Epstein was a sick sob who had friends in high places - the same friends that hang out with Tony Podesta.

You think Epstein was the only one? That he's somehow unique? Or was he the low level one they were willing to sacrifice to protect everyone else involved at a higher level?

Do you realize now that when it comes to trafficking, satanism, pedophilia, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, adrenachrome - that it is art imitating life? That these people who are so obsessed with the art that glorifes these things might actually, themselves, be engaged in these things?

Do you think normal, non-pedo, non-cannibal, average Joes would hang that garbage up in their homes?

Suddenly the claims that world leaders and governments being involved in this satanic horror show isn't so far fetched after all.

Suddenly its not so crazy to say that world agencies who claim to stop these crimes (WHO, UN) are actually facades that cover up the real work of procuring and enabling - yes, even participating - in these crimes.

Suddenly the whole house of cards comes crashing down.

With this one case, all the unbelievers are silenced.

For crying out loud, this trial was in 2004! Did you remember it? If not, do you wonder why it was not front page news across the world?

And if you're asking yourself HOW DO THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THIS - have you not yet figured out that the very people who are supposed to end it, are doing it?

Most everyone has watched an Epstein documentary on Netflix - I think there's been maybe 3 or 4 made since his death. And the one thing I heard people say over and over and over again was this: ""Where is Epstein's girlfriend and why hasn't she been arrested yet?""

Did anyone asking that question even try to find the answer? Or did you just shrug your shoulders and say, ""Well, it is what it is and there's nothing I can do about it"" and go on with your life?

Let me help you out.

Did you hear the news story from two weeks ago that President Trump fired federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman? He was the prosecutor in charge of the Epstein case.

AG Barr requested Berman step down, and Berman refused. So Trump fired him and Berman was replaced with prosecutor Audrey Strauss. And then suddenly BAM! Maxwell is in custody.

You now get a front row seat for the horror show that is about to come out.

You will not believe who is involved and how deep it goes. And you will not believe the lengths they'll go to in order to protect their secrets.",conspiracy,Podesta
140,PizzaGate is just the tip of the iceberg. A global PedoGate of profound criminality committed against the children of the world that has been kept secret for too long.,516.0,5kyjw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5kyjw3/pizzagate_is_just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg_a_global/,127.0,1483038369.0,"https://newsununity.com/2016/12/29/pedogate-a-special-report-on-the-washington-d-c-pedophilia-scandal/#more-19669


Nevertheless, every journalist ought to be aware that it is Pizzagate that will ultimately take down World Shadow Government that unlawfully controls the US Government and every other Western power.
The Internet is now overwhelmed by misinformation, disinformation and false information about the Washington, D.C. scandal known primarily as Pizzagate.


Pedogate is Global, Pizzagate is Local
Many have complained that Pizzagate should be called Pedogate.
In fact, Pizzagate is just one of many Pedogates occurring around the world at this very moment.  As the title indicates, “Pizzagate Represents Only a Single American Franchise Within a Worldwide Child Trafficking Operation Known As Pedogate“.


The most critical point here is that Pizzagate is the lynchpin that is inextricably connected to all the other Pedogates.  Because it represents the child exploitation operation in the nation’s capital and related power centers, its outing has the capacity to expose the whole bloody child abuse culture.  Yes, Pizzagate is that prominently configured within the world-wide Pedogate scandal.  It’s not the grand-daddy like the Brussels Pedogate, but it involves a Who’s Who of American society and especially the political class.


First, it’s important to understand that Pizzagate was revealed by the double whammy of the Podesta WikiLeaks and Anthony Weiner’s 650,000 emails.  In other words, the time had come for this pedophilia in high places to be blown wide open.  Because it all went down just a couple of weeks before the most contentious election in U.S. history, the whole world was watching the American political theater with utter amazement.


What the reader needs to understand is that Pizzagate represents only the tip of the iceberg—a global iceberg of profound criminality committed against the children of the world.  Not only does it concern a much larger worldwide pedophilia ring known as Pedogate, it also involves an international crime syndicate that trades in the exploitation of children—EVERYWHERE —24/7.


What makes Pizzagate so very explosive is that all of the key players are deep in D.C. politics and Washington power-plays, US government influence peddling and federal power-brokering.  And then there is the C.I.A., often regarded as the intelligence agency that not only controls the many Pedogates occurring nationwide, but also closely monitors each and every one of them.  After all, these unimaginable child abuse operations are implemented — first and foremost — as the primary control mechanism that keeps American politicians in complete check.


The C.I.A. has always been notorious for being deeply involved in the top 3 illicit revenue-producing operations of the world.  Drug trafficking and arms trafficking are both quite HUGE; however, it is child trafficking that really keeps them in business.  The CIA has so many black budgeted operations to fund that they require massive funding from these criminal activities to continue to run them across the planet.  Child trafficking also provides a special means to control those in positions of perceived power.  However, it is those who occupy the highest echelons of the global power structure who are also taken care of by way of this global pedophilia ring.


The very endeavor that put the Clinton Foundation on the map was its response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti.  However, a woman who was caught and convicted of child smuggling (33 children) — Laura Silsby — and who Secretary of State Clinton tried to protect from prosecution, also has ties to the Foundation.  Which is why the mainstream media (MSM) was eerily silent on this whole criminal matter.


Because the C.I.A. uses pedophilia to control so many politicians, Mr. Alefantis was quite unbelievably identified as the “49th most powerful man in Washington, D.C.”  He is also on record for visiting the White House at least 5 times.  He has photos of himself with Tony Podesta, half of the super-lobbyist duo with brother John Podesta.  And he has a thank you letter signed by Hillary Clinton for the use of his restaurant for a Democratic event that raised some serious money.


The only way that the global Pedogate operations can be terminated is for people of good will and those with a conscience to face it front on.  The perps have only gotten away with so much flagrant criminality against the children because of the unwillingness of good people to acknowledge its occurrence.  Even those who know all about it are either afraid or unwilling to stop it.

#Remote Viewing

##Project StarGATE
[CIA powerpoint on Project StarGATE](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2.pdf)

[Remote Viewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at [SRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International) in the 1960's with the famous psychic [Ingo Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann). The two most famous physicists involved in these experiments were [Russell Targ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Targ) and [Hal Puthoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff) who were very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics which would allow for psychic abilities to operate.  Ingo was one of the first members of [Project StarGATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project) which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program ([source](http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562)). I will be referring to the CIA in this section because of their recent declassification surrounding a lot of these documents.

[This is an example](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf) of using Remote Viewing (astral projection) to spy on a Soviet base off the Ural Mountains

[Here is a document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) purporting to show a Remote Viewing session of Mars at 1 Million B.C. which we will come back to later in the post.

##Revisiting Quantum Mechanics

[Nonlocality]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality) is a property of Quantum Mechanics which states that entangled particles affect each others' quantum state instantaneously, seemingly transmitting information faster than the speed of light. In [this](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) CIA paper we gain insight into what the CIA calls [The Gateway Process](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/catalog/122) using [Hemi-Sync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-Sync) technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:
> You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works

He then goes on to explain the foundations of [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation), [Brain Coherence](https://npepjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40810-015-0015-7), [Holograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a universal consciousness matrix, [OBEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience) and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.

As if this isn't strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell's conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:
>Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded

This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness.

[The Bohm-Aharanov Effect and Scalar Interferometry](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900680014-4.pdf)

##Quick aside - Connection to DMT?
There is a lot of research done by people such as [Terrence McKenna]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna) which shows that psychedelic drugs (which places the subject in an altered state of consciousness) often cause the subject to see and interact with seemingly intelligent entities while tripping. [This great article](https://www.sociedelic.com/apparent-communication-with-discarnate-entities-induced-by-dmt/) shows an undeniable correlation between ingestion of psychadelics and contact with intelligent entities.

##Remote Viewing and Humanoid Contact
Revisiting the [Mars paper](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:
>SUB: I'm seeing ah.... It's like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it's only a shadow. It's as if they were there and they're not, not there anymore.

>MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.

>SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they're very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes. 

>MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.

So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was *specifically* the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:
>MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.

>SUB: They're ancient people. They're ah... they're dying, it's past their time or age. They're very philosophic about it. They're looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can't seem to get their way out, they can't seem to find their way out... so they're hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...

> MON: What is is they're waiting for?

>SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It's like I'm getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It's failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.

...

>MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?

>SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn't know who I am. Think he perceives I'm just a hallucination or something.

>MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?

>SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.

>MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.

>SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it's very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.

From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.

#Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs
It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950's, so I don't intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.

##Emails to John Podesta from Edgar Mitchell and Tom Delonge
Regardless of your opinion of Tom Delonge, I think it's important to include these emails here because it shows at the very least government and military officials involved with the coverup of the UFO phenomena cooperating with him and feeding him information which is tied to the psychic phenomena and crashed UFO sightings. For important sections of the emails I will include quotes.

[Email showing Terri Mansfield setting up a Skype meeting for Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6983)
>Dear John,

>In ongoing requests for our Skype talk to discuss Disclosure and the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent obedient ETI and the celestials of this universe, and because Hillary and Bill Clinton were intimates of Laurance Rockefeller who had an avid interest in ETI, I direct your attention to Scott Jones, PhD.
In Scott’s book Voices From the Cosmos, he describes himself as an octogenarian in full karmic payback made following 30 years in the military, half in combat arms and half in intelligence.
He references you in his ETI matter, as well as the Catholic Church.

>For many years you and I have shared a mutual vision of disclosure. I highly commend your public record urging disclosure which includes the forward you wrote for Leslie Kean’s book and your call for the Pentagon’s release of 25 year old classified government papers on UFO investigations. When our government releases this classified information we become the twenty-fifth country to make public disclosure.

>You and I also share a mutual vision for earth sustainability apparent in the escalating demand for a change in global energy policy. Our phone discussion will also include the zero point energy research and applications developed by my Quantrek international science team.

After seeing a thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bong6/working_theory_according_to_rod_wheeler_pi/) that Amy Dacey might be a key person at DNC connected to Seth since she was his boss while he was working on the Voter App project, I searched back through the wiki podesta files to see if she came up and YES SHE DID. Im going to start here and connect it all back to Seth and how she might be a key player in all this.

Rewind back to 2007, Amy worked for SEIU and has a LONG history of working with Podesta. Here's an email about a meeting she set up with lots of names we will recognize (hint: Ballsack Eyes!) https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40160
(note: This email has Amy Dacey setting up a meeting between Soros and Co. Herb and Marion Sandler are listed in that meeting. Herb Sandler is the person who wrote the email to Podesta asking if he'd do better playing dominoes on cheese or on pasta.)

She moved to the Government Relations Dept with SEIU: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26012 And she also was Executive Director at Fund for America working with the same crowd: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24363
She then went on to be CEO of the DNC and was leading the investigation into the voter database compromise that happened in December 15. Tl;dr for those that dont remember: the dnc voter database was compromised and Bernie campaign ended up w voter info from Hillarys campaign. They had NGA VAN do a few audits to find what was compromised and reported the results and who was responsible in the Bernie campaign for accessing info they weren't supposed to. The director of voter data for the Bernie campaign was fired as a result. This is the report she sent out after the initial audit: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15792 At the end of this report, she refers to continuing the audit which is when I think they might have initially discovered Seth as a leaker. The DNC has also instructed NGP VAN to conduct a review process of their internal procedures to identify how this mistake was allowed to happen and prevent further such mistakes. The DNC is currently beginning the process of securing an additional, independent audit by a data security firm of NGP VAN’s procedures.

As a result of this analysis, NGP VAN found that campaign staff on the Sanders campaign, including the campaign’s national data director, had accessed proprietary information about which voters were being targeted by the Clinton campaign — and in doing so violated their agreements with the DNC. After discovering, he accessed things he shouldn't have and suspected him, then that could have lead to the unmasking hunch everyone has for further surveillance. If that is the case then perhaps this NGP VAN is also a point of research as they would have played a part in uncovering this? Other important note: he was working on the voter app project for dnc when he discovered the fraudulent voting sites issue, which was reportedly one of his motivations to work with Wikileaks. If you read the emails exchanges during the Bernie/DNC Voter Compromise, the Hillary campaign wanted to know the ""ACTUAL DAMAGE"" of the compromise perhaps afraid the fraud would be discovered? https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35361

According to a few news articles Seth made the exchange to this ex MI6 agent that now works with Wikileaks in September. http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/ Important because if we was exchanging info back in September and continuing through this ongoing audit/investigation which started in December then it could've been discovered during that.

Antonin Gregory Scalia was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 until his death in 2016. Scalia died in his sleep at age 79 on the night of February 12 or the morning of February 13, 2016 in Shafter, Texas. He was pronounced dead of apparent natural causes.

# Possible assassination and involvement of John Podesta
[John Podesta referencing wet works days before Scalia dies](http://pizzagate.wiki/images/d/d0/Scalia-wetworks.png)

The above image is of an email, discovered in the Podesta emails provided by Wikileaks, which shows John Podesta talking to a Steve Elmendorf about ""wet works"" at ""the Vineyard"" just 3 days before Scalia's death: https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6008

Famous Reddit informant [FBIanon](http://pizzagate.wiki/FBIanon) has suggested that Justice Scalia was looking into something the Clinton Foundation did not want seen.

A few hours after Scalia's body was found, John Podesta received an email from Chris Stone of George Soros' Open Society Foundation discussing a possible replacement for Scalia: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48389

Podesta receives another suggestion for a replacement Justice at this time from a Brent Budowsky: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3789

# Potentially coded email describing the plot
There is another email sent to John Podesta from a ""viejojoe"" in which a ""2016 political, game changing film project"" is discussed almost exactly a year before Scalia's death: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1459

This lengthy email includes a single link to the Smithsonian's website which is a map of Texas can be seen: http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html

There is a single area which specifically has a line drawn to it, titled ""Claimed by Mexico and the Texas"". This location, as can be seen by our image comparison seen below, is almost identical to the location of Scalia's vineyard. 

>I have the script, the budget and a producer for this 2016 political, game changing film project - funding is needed. You would be in charge of the content and selecting the producer.

There is speculation that this email is a lengthy coded message, which seems to be supported by the mysterious nature of the sender, the sender's use of false personal information like being ""Joe Patterson"", and the ""plot"" of the movie discussed. Who would need to ask John Podesta to read a movie script anyway?

# Events after death which hint at a cover-up

In addition there were many unusual events following Scalia's death which hindered any further investigation:

* No autopsy
* No medical examiner on site to decipher cause of death
* No U.S. Marshal protection detail accompanying Scalia
* No functioning CCTV cameras on day of death
* Scalia was found clothed on bed with pillow over face
* Scalia’s body was mysteriously cremated before it could be examined

The DNC hack is not how Podestas emails got out. Just because there was a hack doesn't mean that it's the source of the leak. In fact Wikileaks has said the exact opposite. 

Today Wikileaks has released various CIA files pertaining to their cyber intelligence operations, but I think it's safe to call the content of these files weapons of cyber warfare. 

A couple weeks ago I wrote this review of the official and private sector reports on Russia being behind the hacking of the DNC and Hillary Clinton and her associates 

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5up4ax/analysis_of_the_russian_hacking_accusations_and/

The core of my conclusions was that we were being given an equation of a type of math we didn't understand, and the reports were claiming to have the answer to the equation without showing their work (how they got that answer). They didn't provide the evidence to support their claims. The original post has much more detail on this. 

This quote from my original post 

>Everything seems to boil down to originating domains and servers being in Russia. Isn't step one of Cyber espionage figuring out how to make it look like you're someone and somewhere you're not? ThreatConnect says things like ""Please note, the presence of these domains on the same name server as DCLeaks and servicetransfermail[.]com does not concretely indicate a tie to Russian activity. However, as repeated use of smaller name servers is a Russian TTP, these domains merit additional scrutiny."" They also say that they traced back Guccifer 2.0 to a russian VPN service. but couldn't anyone buy a Russian VPN and wouldn't someone trying to not appear like they a Russian avoid using a Russian VPN? just questions I have.

My main issue with their claims was that they were pointing to indicators that to me were the first things you would mask as an attacker. In today's Wikileaks release (part 1 of Vault 7) mine and many other people's suspicions were confirmed. The CIA does indeed take extensive measure to mask their attacks by copying the attributes and digital ""finger prints"" of other nations, including Russia.

>The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.

>With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.

In other words all the ""evidence"" provided by the private sector and government reports falls under the scope of the UMBRAGE program meaning the ""evidence"" is no longer even slightly indicative of who the attackers are. ",conspiracy,Podesta

Hillary paid for the legal defense of a haitian woman caught illegally taking 33 children from haiti . The children were not even orphans so no ""better life"" excuse. The lawyer they paid for WAS A CONVICTED CHILD TRAFFICKER.
The individual in question is one Laura Silsby, former director of The New Life Children's Refuge. She was caught trying to steal 33 children from the country, most of whom were not even orphans and had families. Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura's NGO. Laura had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose. They instead located to Haiti. Sources: https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465 Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman's organization: https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772 One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook: http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf And the attorney who represented Laura Silsby?

“To all the people confused about Spanish comments and the PizzaGate hashtag: It's gonna get long but bare with me. Latino and Spanish people are theorising that this video contains symbolism exposing pedophilia in the music industry and elite of the world in general. Here are all the clues that have led them to believe this:

1.	⁠The party includes very rich people dining and being entertained by kids playing violin.
2.	⁠Justin promoted the song on instagram using the hashtag Yummy and pictures of babies.He also seems ""desperate"" for people to stream the song 24/7, maybe because he's not getting support for it's distribution. He also shared a logo of the title Yummy stylized after pizza (PizzaGate pedophile rings).
3.	⁠Some of the foods are quite  disgusting, in contrast with the title Yummy (pedophilia is disgusting but the pedos enjoy it).
4.	⁠Everytime Justin takes a bite of food 0:42 he seems overly excited and at one point his jaw enlargens abnormally 2:21 (effects of being drugged, excitement and hallucinations).
5.	⁠The old man with huge glasses 0:48 seems to represent John Podesta, powerful political consultant who worked with Obama and the Clintons. He was involved in the PizzaGate scandal after emails were leaked containing coded language in the form of different foods, which pedos use to refer to children, child porn and sexual acts. Any coincidence this video contains so much food when he could have made it about anything else?
6.	⁠The black waiter 2:19 on the right side of the screen, seems to represent L.A. Reid, who discovered Justin at the beginning of his career since he was 14 and made inappropriate comments about his looks saying he was ""beautiful like a woman could be"".
7.	⁠The blonde lady eating french fries 0:24 could represent Jenny McCarthy, former playboy model who handed Justin an award at the 2012 AMAs, where she was wearing very similar earrings, glasses and hairstyle as the lady in the video. She got physically inappropriate with Justin and he said later on he felt violated by her actions.
8.	⁠One of the cakes includes lots of blue swirls 1:18 which have been confirmed by the FBI to be symbols that pedophiles use.
9.	⁠At the end scene 3:33 on Justin's right (your left) behind his table you can see a red outfit which is the same that the girl in the beginning playing violin is wearing 0:21 (insinuating she was abused during the party).
10.	⁠In that scene, only Justin, ""John Podesta"" and ""L.A. Reid"" remain. Podesta is still eating (abusing children), Reid is cleaning up the mess (covering up after the pedos) and Justin has a plate with a cake in front of him which underneath reveals a photo of his kid self with the word Yummy under it (insinuating he was once the ""meal"", or in other words abused).

You might think this is all conspiracy theorist BS but keep in mind that pedophile rings amongst elitists are not a myth but a proven fact. Look no further than Jeffrey Epstein. He had a whole island where he and his pedo friends satisfied their sick perversions. Once he got caught and was ready to drop names he mysteriously ""killed himself"", even though he was in a high security cell with surveillance 24/7,  designed specifically to prevent it's prisoners from killing themselves.

Bill Gates owns the patent for Coronavirus.

Bill Gates has partial ownership of all 4 biolabs in Wuhan, China. (George Soros has a partial stake in 3).

Bill gates funds the Lieber Foundation which is headed by Charles Lieber, arrested on 28 January 2020 for espionage selling Bioweapons to China, to the same Labs Bill Gates partially owns.

Bill Gates is the primary financier of the World Health Organization. Donating more than $2 Billion over the last decade. The W.H.O. that complimented China and discouraged any 'over-reaction'.

Bill Gates held 'Event 201' in October 2019 simulating a Coronavirus Pandemic, seemingly 30 days prior to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Sponsored by John's Hopkins.

Bill Gates real name is William Henry Gates III, and he is a 12th generation Rockefeller; the Rockefellers own the large majority of healthcare infrastructure throughout the united states, including John's Hopkins which is the official score keeper for Coronavirus.

Bill Gates is on the Epstien Flight Logs.

Bill Gates partnered with Maria Abromovic, staring in Microsoft Commercials. Maria Abromovic is known as the most influential Satanist whom appears in Hillary and Podesta's leaked Emails; she is very specifically connected to pedophilia and torcher in cases such as Epstein, Weinstein, and NXVIM; all of which were brought down as a direct result of Clinton's emails. (Laura Silsbey as well, Clinton Foundation).

Bill Gates father chaired the board of Planned Parenthood; during it's infancy when it was no-secret that it was a eugenics program against colored people. 

Bill Gates has been sued and tried criminally in Africa and India (GUILTY) for crimes against humanity by way of forced vaccinations which caused severe side-effects and death.

Bill Gates has publicly stated that he wants to depopulate the planet using vaccines. Now he wants to chip every person on the planet with ID2020, as a digital passport to travel or work.

If you want to know who is behind Coronavirus, it is the same man who's fingerprints are all over it, and who thinks that he is out in front of it. 

If these facts don't paint the picture for you, I can't help you. You are already dead.

Edit in response to $oUrCeS!!!: If you're too lazy to research this yourself and don't know how to tell the difference between 'fact-checkers' and actual facts, there really is nothing I can do. People are quite litteraly brainwashed to be sheep. If I laid out carefully picked links for each and every point, the people asking for sources would just provide a bogus fact checker, deny it, and go about their happy little sheeply lives. People aren't taught, they have to have a desire to learn. I gave more than enough direction to start people researching. They either research, or they would never have accepted any amount of proof to begin with.

Case and point, Wienstien, Epstien, NXVIM, Silsbey are all directly tied to Clinton, yet people will claim Pizzagate is a lie because of factcheckers and MSM, despite the extremely obvious evidence, the criminal convictions, the emails, the guilty pleas. If someone can't come to grips with that and yet asks for sources, that's a person who was never under any circumstances going to accept the truth.",conspiracy,Podesta

Welcome to Skull and Bones. The Foundation for Art and Preservation of Embassies is made up of dozens of billionaire families and politicians with ties to the global elite who are able to ship artwork around the world without passing through conventional security channels. They have partnered with the Rothschild, and Alefantis, The Podestas and Hillary Clinton are involved.

50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair **1** celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. Here are some of them posing for a photo. **2**

Here is a detailed listing of the FAPE board members, which includes such figures as The Rockefellers, the Annenbergs (funded Obama), Tony Podesta, the Estee Lauder family, John Kerry and Meryl Streep.

My research into the Embassy Art shipments began when the Howard Gutman Belgian embassy pedophilia scandal appeared on Voat, and somehow no one in the state department did anything to stop Gutman from doing his job.

( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10114694/US-state-department-accused-of-covering-up-prostitution-investigation.html )

An ambassador, believed to be Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman, who ""routinely ditched ... his protective security detail,"" and inspectors suspect this was in order to ""solicit sexual favors from prostitutes,"" some of whom were underage. The investigation into Gutman was called off after his meeting with Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy.

**Beth Dozoretz**

Today, Art in Embassies in run by Beth Dozoretz, a close friend of Hillary Clinton and famous for helping Bill Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his final day in office. **1** To quote Vanity Fair, Dozoretz became drew attention to herself when ""she played a key role in persuading her friend Bill Clinton to pardon her fugitive billionaire ex-husband, Marc Rich”. As is the case with most Hillary Clinton confidantes, the more effort they put into covering up international crime and trafficking, the higher they climbed. And even though Hillary’s state department did little to oversee embassies during her tenure as SoS, she still invested a ton of time and effort into promoting Art in Embassies.

**1** ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106 )

Dozoretz has worked with Alefantis before and they are closely linked among the D.C. elite. This shows that Alefantis, at the very least, is closely tied to the center of globalist power in America, and with the podesta brothers & company.

**Skull & Bones, kings of opium and smuggling**

The Art in Embassies program is run by many members/alumni of the Yale circle of elites, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Robert Storr (Dean of Yale School of Art) and many other industrialist families behind some of America’s best-known brands. The Sackler's, the family behind Purdue Pharma (Valium and Oxycontin), clearly took time away from their role as drug-pushers to promote the arts with the global elite. Here they are with their esteemed lapdog Alec Baldwin.

( http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg )

This is an important detail I can’t stress enough. They literally controlled the Opium market with a prescription drug, exactly as the United States did in Afghanistan, all the way back to the era of the Opium Wars in China…which Skull and Bones controlled. Remember, these families are primarily located around connecticut.

The Sacklers, who have coordinated events with James Alefantis, **1** presented medals to Marina Abramovic and Jeff Koons, whose former wife stated that Koons made his Child touch his private area **2** both of whose work have been transported on these aircraft multiple times, some directly through the Tony and Heather Podesta collection. In fact, Podesta “gifted” transported some of Abramovic’s ""bloody"" work to Whitechapel, London, **3** supported in part by the ""UK Friends of the National Museum of Women Artists"". Notice how they conceal their organizations--diplomatic groups functioning within art galleries.

**3** ( http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/terrains-of-the-body-photography-from-the-national-museum-of-women-in-the-arts/ )

The event shows that it’s not simply celebrating art, but actually announcing the sending of the paintings.

>The event marks the beginning of a landmark collaboration between the Sackler and Art in Embassies. In coming years, **the Sackler will host exhibitions of works by contemporary Asian and Asian American artists before their installation by Arts in Embassies at new U.S. embassies overseas.**

Here’s where it gets weirder. Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event. **1** Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes.

Please Note Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.

**Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass**

One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.

( https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php )

( http://www.multimodalintl.com/ )

The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.

>This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain **endangered species or animal products**), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others. **We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.**

While their corporate headquarters are in Manhattan, Masterpiece International has other 'public' locations which are interesting, including West Palm Beach and Miami Beach; places famous for all kinds of ""cargo"" so bypassing security is very convenient for them. 

The founder of this shipping outfit is David B. Epstein (his genealogy is scrubbed as it that of Jeffrey Epstein, so I couldn't see if they might be actually related. Not much about David on the web, but there's this in the public domain. 

( https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx )

When I noticed that Masterpiece International has a business relationship with the largest shipping container firm in the world which is 49% owned by the govt of Israel, then it got interesting. You can see ZIM on this rate increase PDF from Masterpiece Intl:

About ZIM 

( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_Integrated_Shipping_Services )

ZIM is global, even has a port in Turkey

( http://www.zim.com/countrysites/asia/turkey/en-us/pages/aboutzim.aspx )

Information that ZIM moved radioactive remains of WTC and sold this ""steel"" to China had been completely scrubbed, but most people have heard of them because they broke their lease to get out of the WTC before 9/11, losing $50K in the process, which is maredly interesting.

>The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moved their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks (VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001). More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten were still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escaped unharmed. (JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001) 

There's a lot on that topic, but here's a link with documentation

( http://historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zim-american_israeli_shipping_co. )

>When ZIM moved out of WTC, an Israeli moving company occupied their floors but escaped unharmed on the big day as well. [How many Muslim owned companies moved out of the WTC complex just before Sept. 11, 2001? 0]

A year later, ZIM was busted with US/Israeli weapons heading to Iran.

So, crime scene evidence, armaments, what else? The closer to the top of the pyramid, the more interconnected it all is. Don't forget that all major art transactions are highly suspect and that ""modern art"" which is a farce, at best, is without value but is great for money laundering. See Miles Mathis excellent paper on this topic here

( http://www.mileswmathis.com/launder.pdf )

Anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?

This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world. If you do not know what the Venice Biennale is, google the logo. Exactly logo to the FBI Boy Lover symbol.

**James Alefantis and the Comet Ping Pong Link**

The Transformer Gallery hosts an annual silent auction, but few have picked up on the detail that every auction requires the transportation of art from another country that we can now know is shipped through diplomatic channels and part of the same larger network of diplomatically-exchanged art. Per the Gallery program:

This is the 13th Annual Auction and a celebration of Transformer’s 15 year anniversary. The Italian Ambassador is our diplomatic chair this year – highlighting year long collaboration with the Italian Embassy in D.C., and artistic exchange with artists and art spaces in Rome and D.C.

From BrightestYoungThings **1**

**1** ( https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/preview-transformers-13th-annual-auction )

>There’s more than 175 works up for silent bidding this year – I think we actually have 190 works! We say this every year – but I truly feel this is our best selection of work up for bidding yet.

For more on James Alefantis and his friends; Google Heavy Breathing, The Apes Band and Pedophilia. 

Be warned, what they say and the images and videos the bands produce are pedophilic in nature and depict torture. Did I mention the main singer of The Apes was a former Special Needs teacher. You can also google her name, I'll let you find it and search her alter-ego drawings of weird creatures. It's as if all of these people were abused in child hood and so too are they doing the same.

**Connection to Skull and Bones**

Alefantis’ connection to Skull and Bones is rather subtle, but it’s telling that all news media has reported Alefantis’ role as an event organizer for this group. This is two-pronged. First, he coordinates events with the Sackler Freer gallery owned by the Opium family. Secondly, regular Comet performer Kid Congo Powers is married to the curator of the Yale University Art Gallery. **1** You know, the former headquarters of Skull and Bones.

**1** ( https://vimeo.com/67959660 )

Kid Congo powers performs with DJ **Baby Alcatraz**, sometimes at Planned Parenthood events. **1** Remember DJ Baby Alcatraz was the one who owned what appeared to be Pizza Map near Marfa. **2** I won't be getting into the details of how perverted these bands are, as that isn't the premise of this post. Do know though, if you google some of these bands do not click tumblr posts of Google+ posts as many lead to boy lover forums and offputting and pedophilic pictures. 

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/F5E0E8a.jpg )

**2** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1647807 )

Kid Congo Powers, former member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, shows a few suspicious habits on his Tumblr. 

( https://imgur.com/a/ip3ZO )

* Making **Erudite references to actual Bavarian Illuminati members and strange comments about the tomb at the Skull and Bones headquarters.**
* Wearing a Bavarian Illuminati-themed Jacket
* Showing up at Transformer auction around ambassadors
* Vampire Teeth, and references to pizza and blood; so not a normal guy. 

We can’t forget Alefantis’ hosting of the Roosevelts and CFR-connected reporters like Wolf Blitzer. **1** A pizza owner who just so happens to know media affiliates for years, who would have thought. The fact that he and Dozoretz are closely linked in hosting these parties, and that major news networks seem just as involved in the afterparties, there’s no question why the entire Beltway wanted to shut this all down.

**1** ( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770143 )

Note that you see the exact same pattern with Susan Alefantis and the Chris Kloman case. **1** Those who defended Kloman include CFR-connected anchors like Charlie Gibson and Clinton cronies like Ken Starr.

**Uribe and the Colombian connection**

The Colombian ambassador to the United States worked for a law firm that, around the time that Comet Ping Pong first became a household name, became involved in a case of satanic abuse homicide in Bogota. The murder of Yuliana Samboni by Rafael Uribe would not be so intriguing were the diplomatic chair at Alefantis’ 10th annual Transformer Gallery auction not connected to the same law firm as the assailant.

The blog ‘Blueberry Perspective summarizes the link very well. 

>James Alefantis has political ties to the same colombian oligarch family where the rich architect son is involved in a **satanic ritual abuse case** with other people of a rape and murder of a seven year old poor girl, and it's being covered up in the colombian media, and by the colombian police, and colombia is a country that at the same time has the clinton foundation, carlos slim and frank giustra heavily involved in raping the natural resources, fake foundation activities, that all deal with youth and children, and banking regulations, are tied to haiti, robbing oil money killing union leaders and workers rights abuses, running illegal investment slush funds, etc

**Art world connections**

The reason that the wealthy run art galleries is that they have a lot of money and want to engage in improving civic culture. That would be all fine and dandy if nearly every major family involved in the Skull and Bones network seems to have a connection to this Shipping lines. James Alefantis, in a sense, works for the Maccoby family because of their links to the Folgers, one of the families involved in FAPE.

The Folgers are heavily involved in the so-called Skull and Bones power circle, and they share both the credentials of being an early connecticut settler family and having an ancestor who was ambassador to Belgium. Notice Alefantis’ proximity to the Folger family. From this Voat Post:

( https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673862 )

>The Folgers, are a secret power elite family since at least the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lee’s mother is Barbara Sue (Bitsy) McElroy.[8] She was the daughter of Harvard’s Neil H. McElroy, former president of the multi-million dollar corporation, Procter & Gamble, and October 9, 1957, appointed President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense. Neil’s grandmother was Mary Camilla Fry of England- baroness, suspected British Knighthood bloodline lineage.[9]

>Neil’s father is financial advisor Lee Merritt Folger– a child sacrifice (Moloch, also spelled Molech) pagan member of the Bohemian Grove.[10] Lee’s father was investment banker, John Clifford Folger (1893-1981), U.S. Ambassador to Belgium (1957-59)- Alfalfa Club.[11] The Folgers are descendants of Peter Folger. Peter was an early 17th century English settler of Martha’s Vineyard.

**Ellen Susman & Pay 4 Play**

Texas Democrat writes to John Podesta asking to be Ambassador to New Zealand after her and her husband donate to HRC. This fits in line with the pay-to-play allegations surfaced by Guccifer 2.0, when he released the ambassador names and the amounts paid to Obama/HRC to get an ambassadorship.

But what’s more interesting is the Ellen Susman sits on the 2015-2016 National Leadership Board of the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.

( http://blantonmuseum.org/national-leadership-board/ http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/well-trod-path-political-donor-to-ambassador.html )

Not everyone wants a gilded posting in a European capital. Ellen Susman, a Texas philanthropist who contributed $100,000 to the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Obama, has alerted people involved in the decision-making of her interest in serving as director of the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, responsible for managing the art collection that hangs in American embassies around the world.

**Amman, Jordan**

But the Transformer gallery not only takes art in from other countries, but also ships the art outward, as well. The presence of art by Matt Sesow, the artist involved in several Transformer auctions and who once painted an uncanny **‘cumpanda’** **1**, was featured in a Jordanian art exhibit. Notice the imagery of the gallery and it’s pederastic “Da Vinci Children’s Exhibition” and the all-seeing eye out front.

**1** ( http://i.imgur.com/bdVvSBg.jpg )

An interesting tidbit to add is that a Syrian diplomatic cable showcases one of the Jordanian gallery’s **1** exhibitions (Wikileaks - A Shout Out From My City **2**), and explains that the exhibition occurred under the patronage of the Ambassador to France. What is important to note is that the auction at the Transformer gallery hosted by James Alefantis was always patronized by a guest ambassador, who made a special art donation to the gallery. Is it proof that he’s smuggling children? No. But does it prove that his connections—including to the Rockefeller’s through Luzzatto, to the Rothschilds, to Skull and bones.

**EXTRA INFO**

____

**Historical precedent to Comet Ping Pong -- an 18th century occult club that lured politicians, lobbyists and ambassadors into a web of blood ritual**

Germaine de Staël, was not only connected to major American diplomats, but also to a mysterious building in Switzerland that Tony Podesta seems to be visiting today. Given their current relationship with ambassadors and actual nobility, it is highly plausible that the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are involved in the same type of operation.

**Body**

During the French Revolution, several notable figures at the highest seats of power in Switzerland and France played decisive roles in overthrowing Louis XVI and guillotining the royal family. It's worth knowing that Soros-type bankers still lorded over Europe at the time--after all, this was the age of Rothschild. Jacques Neckar, from Switzerland, was one such rival and became a finance minister under Louis XVI for France. During the revolution, he barely managed to hold France together, but according to Wikipedia, he also helped spark one of the bloodiest days of the Revolution:

>Necker's dismissal on 11 July 1789, provoked by his decision not to attend Louis XVI's speech to the Estates-General, enraged the people of France and sparked rumors that the king meant to attack Paris or arrest the deputies. These fears provoked the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.

But there's so much more to this. His daughter, Germaine de Staël, was a gifted writer and power player in the French Salons. She would end up being one of Napoleon's sworn enemies as she tried to subvert his power on several occasions. She was also married to the Swedish ambassador in France. While still young, she ran her own salon in Paris with the ambassador, and they quickly gained a reputation as **being a hotspot for the actual Illuminati and Swedenborgian Cult.** Quotes from the book ""Mistress to an Age: A Life of Madame de Stael"" reveal she was known to the American political elite as well.

>Germaine’s salon in the rue du Bac had become a political meeting place for the liberal aristocracy which soon was to carry out the first phase of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morries, a frequent guest, described Germaine to George Washington as “a woman of wonderful wit, and above prejudices of every kind,” and her house as a temple of Apollo.

Evidence also suggests that the Illuminati/Swedenborgians were involved in some bizarre sorcerer deep-state activities, as we see now with Jimmy Savile, 'Especially' Michael Aquino, wikipedia page scrubbed and the 'Podestas' activities.

>[Monsieur de Stael] had also turned to the Swedenborgian sect, was deeply involved in the mysticism of the Illuminati, and indulged in conjuring spirits...In the Age of Reason, at at the court of the enlightened despot Gustavus, two opposed schools of sorcerers and soothsayers were engaged in secret and mortal combat. King Gustavus’ clairvoyant, Miss Arfwedsson, whose oracle he consulted on every important occasion, was all-powerful, but she was decidedly outnumbered by the soothsayers who surrounded the King’s brother, Duke Charles of Sudermania, for whom they predicted a glorious future. Most influential among them was the Duke’s friend, Baron Reuterholm, who, before witnesses, had put the **Duke into a hypnotic trance to make him prophesy the role he was to play in the regeneration of Mankind.**

>Baron de Stael already had attached to his embassy a Swedenborgian named Halldin, whose specialty it was to make spirits appear in mirrors (he thus produced John the Baptist) and **to read the future in books stained with blood.** Under Reuterholm’s influence these innocent pastimes took a more serious turn.

>At one of the seances held in 1790 in Stael’s presence, a medium revealed that Duke Chatlr was “in possession of the truth itself” and that Reuterholm be his only instrument…”Mention of the King was also made; what has been said concerning His Majesty is of great interest but of such a nature that I dare not trust it to my pen.”

They were literally performing mind control/hypnosis to major political figures to help them carry out political goals. This is congruent with allegations of both the CIA and Globalists blackmailing VIP pedophiles to further their aim. What's also interesting is that Le Bac was a favorite among lobbyists, and was actually known to court the most powerful American diplomats at the time. Staël met Jefferson, Washington, Adams; but what's most interesting is that Madame de Staël is (1) in such an identical position to American socialite James Alefantis, who frequently courts ambassadors from his art functions. Think I'm exaggerating? Here he is hosting the Swedish ambassador. **1** Another Transformer event was even held at the French embassy, and Alefantis has helped organize events with actual French nobility. **2** History repeats itself, and there's even MORE proof.

In some amazing coincidence, Stratfor leaks indicate that Tony Podesta was subscribing to Stratfor from a property in Lausanne. **1** Turns out, he's actually connected to Lausanne through his family and through the art world: Several pieces by Giovanni Battista Podesta, one of the purported ""founders"" of Art Brut, appear at the Collection Art Brut, **2** located in a castle in the town called Le Chateau Beaulieu. He is a worshipper of Mammon. **3** If you want a better idea of what art brut is, please look here. **4** Art brut is essentially ""trauma art"", **5** where victims of trauma, including satanist abuse and pedophilia, paint their experiences. I have spoken to actual art brut collectors who have confirmed this, and who have also admitted that many of the artists come from ""transcendental cults"". Also, abuse victim Kim Noble's work is Art Brut. **6**

We also know that Tony Podesta is connected to this Art Brut art movement for three reasons: (1) He opened the **""Art Blu"" café in Venice, where he owns another property, (2)** **1** he owns countless paintings that are or could be deemed Art Brut and (3) **James Alefantis is one of the biggest patrons of art brut on the East Coast, if not America.** And the painters he helps showcase have painted **pedophilia** **2** and **cumpandas** **3** (Matt Sesow, the artist in question, appears to have been a regular at Comet Ping Pong). So what's the big deal with this castle that Podesta is secretly visiting?

* **It's the old home of Jacques Neckar and Madame de Staël.** Literal Illuminati members use to live there and held unimaginable financial power over Europe. Now Tony Podesta is directly involved with visiting the same property as one of the top--if not THE top American lobbyist--in the world.

* **The group at the Chateau Beaulieu appears to be still tied to pedophilia.** 
There is a call to the board at the bottom of the page to go on an excursion ""every leap year"" **1** to Sciacca in Sicily. It's the home of a sculpture garden and art brut artist pictured here. **2** Now it's owned by a **vineyard called Strada Del Vino Terra Sicane.** **This is their logo.** **3** That logo is one we've seen time and again--and yes I am going to make the case that Comet Ping Pong is far, far more than just a one-off fake news hoax. I think it's at the very heart of this organization, whether it be a place to blackmail people or meet secretly with members of the global elite. It's a perfect cover.

I've been reading everything I can about the pizzagate stuff, and the history of satanic abuse of children by the establishment, including Podesta, Clintons, etc. And also the Queen of England, with children going missing from native schools and other institutions in Canada. Much of this has been documented by David Icke. And I've read a great deal of it, including individual cases of abducted and sexually tortured and/or missing children.

I was on a personal vacation at a resort in Mexico, way down south. I was talking to this couple I had met from the Ottawa region and we were making some typical small talk and I said something flip about the govt or something. I don't even remember what exactly started the conversation down the path it took. But she reacted and said that she gets livid at the thought of a Trudeau. She then told me point blank that she had been satanically ritually raped and physically abused by Trudeau senior and several other high ranking govt people of the day. When she was around 5 years old, about 55 years ago.

I was stunned. I was not expecting anything like this. I told her that I believed her 100%. A year ago I might have thought that she was batshit crazy. But I believed her 100% now. And I told her that. 

I asked her if she had documented this in any way. She said that David Icke had done that. Then it hit me, I remember reading about this case specifically. Slowly the details started to come back to me as to what I had read about it.

She showed me scars on her wrists. Again, I was stunned. The reality of all of this and the whole weight of the massive affair hit me in the gut. Hard. It was emotionally overwhelming.

Out of my stunned fog, I was able to ask her one question. I recalled that pizzagate email talking about the found hankerchief and the ""map"". I asked her if they had placed a hankerchief under her, if she recalled that detail, and she said yes. I asked her if she knew what they called them, did they call it a map? She said no, they called it a flag. And she said that the Pearson people actually got a laugh out of the idea of the new Canadian flag and their use of the word flag to describe their hankerchiefs. And if you look at the Canadian flag it two lines of red and a splotch of red on white. Now that is fucking morbid.

That's when I had to break off the conversation. I was torn between wanting to know more but not wanting to know more. I also did not want to make her go thru the telling of this again, although I really don't know if she would feel better about talking it out or if it would just make her relive it and cause her more pain.

But it was more than I could handle. It was totally unexpected and out of the blue. It hit me hard emotionally. Like I told her, all this time I've been reading about all of this, well, it's over there where I can read about it at a distance, and when I met her, now it's right here, right in front of me. right in my face. I am still stunned and shocked. The reality smacked me in the face with a two-hander. And I was not prepared for it.

We need to keep pushing this. We need to keep making people aware. We need to stop this. I don't know how we can make a difference, but we have to try our best.

Thanks for listening to me.

*****************************************

***The Recent ""Chatter""***

https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771

Federal prosecutors are considering charging Anthony Weiner with possession of child pornography. Keep in mind that Weiner getting busted for sexting a 15 year old is what lead to the NYPD seizing the laptop shared between Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin (Hillary's right hand for years). Keep these two things in mind:

1.) NYPD had possession of and forensically investigated the Weiner-Abedin laptop for four to six weeks before the FBI disclosed to the public both knowledge of the laptop and the investigation into Hillary Clinton being reopened.

2.) The FBI announced the laptop and the re-opening of the investigation on the evening of Friday October 28, 2016.

Good timing allowed me to watch the FBI press conference as I walked in from work and just as it began. I had Twitter open on my phone and it started blowing up with tweets along the following lines:

""My sister's husband works for the NYPD. Rumor is that the laptop contains evidence of pedophilia and child / sex trafficking. The NYPD has been quietly working on this for weeks, but the cat was let out of the bag internally and it is all anyone in the entire department can talk about right now.""

You can apply relevant hashtags to a twitter search and then scroll back to the tweets from October 28 in order to get the specific tweets.

https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/take-second-look

PSA released by Department of Homeland Security. The message is to remain vigilant and on the look out for signs of human trafficking. Notice how the opening shot is in front of a pizza shop and the synched dialogue is ""The signs are everywhere; sometimes you just have to take a second look.""

The six links above were tweeted by @FBIRecordsVault, the twitter account run by the department / division of the FBI responsible for releasing newly declassified information and permissible FOIA requests which may be of interest to the public at large.

Each page contains a PDF file of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Foundation. The biggest takeaways are the following:

1.) The FBI determined that the number of private servers used by Clinton and associates demonstrated willful intent to conceal emails which were subject to FOIA regulations for the purpose of preserving the emails and making them public; and 

2.) The FBI discovered >1,500 work emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin. The emails were supposed to be turned over under the terms of a federal subpoena. They were never turned over and they were discovered after Clinton and her legal team claimed to have turned over.

3.) Then Attorney General Loretta Lynch used to do the accounting records for Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Foundation. Needless to say, this was a huge, undisclosed conflict of interest. Obstruction of justice by Lynch  and the DOJ to cover their asses has become blatantly obvious.

200,Anybody else have a distinct sense that there's a major false flag incoming?,386.0,5i9al6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5i9al6/anybody_else_have_a_distinct_sense_that_theres_a/,154.0,1481700265.0,"Just a theory, wondering if anyone else is seeing this unfold. 

Russia will be formally accused of hacking our election. But this is *not* going to be used to make the EC vote differently. 

It is going to be used as a pretext to launch a cyber counter-attack on Russia (as Biden already said), a process that will ultimately force Russia into conflict.

 How do we know this?

Because the ruling regime will lose a civil war, so civil war is not an option. Assassinating Trump or flipping the EC would both trigger civil war -- which the State will lose -- so that is not an option. (Cross reference ""Red Team Planner."")

But they feel they *can* win WW3. They have already been preparing. It is something they've already been planning. It is a nuclear exchange with Russia.

There is one problem: Russia has the blackmail videos of politicians raping children. Up til now, Russia has used the threat of a leak as a deterrent against conflict. (Confirmed by FBI Anon.)

Now, here's the only way for the political class to eliminate that threat of exposure, keep Trump out, and go ahead with the conflict that has been planned for quite some time now (the plan that Hillary was supposed to carry out).

It you assume they are thinking logically, it is their best and possibly only available option at this point. 

Look at the patterns and you'll see. Bill Gates suddenly portayed by media as open to Trump. (Thus he (or rather his OS) will not be suspected as involved.)

NYT suddenly saying Russia can plant child porn on computers. 

Folks they are setting the stage already.

Here's how they can still win, if.you assume they are rational actors and need to cover up their crimes to maintain power.

Many of our machines will be infected with child porn nationwide. They probably already have been. (Anybody notice your comp acting weird lately? Have you noticed any honeypot links? Increased updates, perhaps? Freezing as if something is being downloaded? Did you get any recent ""Amber alerts"" on your smartphone?) 

Suddenly thousands will be seeing brutal child rape. On their phones, on their computers. Maybe on Televisions. It will sicken the nation. If it involves a child being killed, it will be big. Very big. It may absolutely traumatize the nation. It will be made to look as if it is Russia planting snuff films/child porn on machines. There might be massive concurrent DDoS attacks as well, which again will be pinned on Russia. 

Why something so insane like this? Why a false flag of this nature, as opposed to one which, say, shuts down the power grid?

Well, you've got to place yourself in the position of a rational politician who risks being exposed to appreciate how it would function as the best exit strategy. Its function is to dilute any attempt by leakers to release the REAL footage implicating the political class. If it is on all of our machines, or even just a sufficient number of machines, it will be impossible at that point for Americans to distinguish between a real leak and ""Russian cyber attack."" 

It will be a crisis. And the frame is set so that anything released must be a cyber attack from Russia.

It will be pinned on a Russian cyber attack. Russia plants child porn, remember? The NYT said so.

This is also why NYT and others have all pulled the stories on the Norwegian pedo ring. They don't want the public to be conscious of the very real precedent that politicians are in pedo rings.  They instead want the public thinking any cp that is found must be a Russian cyber attack.

It's really the only way they can escape this. An EMP would be too costly and transparent. 

The narrative is already in place. It will be the digital 9/11.

The Internet will have to be restricted and mostly shut down, and people will understand once they are convinced Russia is putting CP on our machines. (This will silence most of us and prevent us from accessing info and dissenting.)

A cyber attack will be initiated on Russia (as Biden confirmed in a previous interview) that will be sufficient to force  Russia into a war. People (idiots) will also welcome this, as they will be so outraged by the CP ""planted by Russia."" And Russia also ""tampered with our election to install that racist Trump."" 

The MSM will all be making it appear that Americans want Obama to strike back.

Israel has already mobilized in Syria. US has sent more as well, and ships are also in place in key locations. Mobilization has been occurring for the last six months.

The first round of nuclear exchange will then occur. Why? Because Russia cannot win in conventional warfare, and so must rely on nuclear weapons.  

And you can guess the rest.

You are seeing it unfold now with the saber rattling against Russia. 

Can we stop it? Perhaps. Only way is to warn everybody right now to expect a false flag of any form and to provide a range of scenarios that might occur. Pre-emptive exposure might work.


Edit to add: a commenter on Voat posted a similar line of thought regarding the recent ""findingassange.com"" link that has been circulating. ***TL;DR:*** be on high fucking alert for any kind of digital false flag being used as a pretext to attack Russia, check the authenticity of everything you read extremely carefully (""verify everything"" ought to be our motto right now). 


 REALLY hate to be the one to hypothesize this , but here is one possible way that the ""findingassange.com"" website could be a trap:

* The website delivers the 15,000 emails and two Insurance Files on schedule.
* They appear to be authentic
* Everybody goes nuts, using the contents of the data dump to launch the biggest lynch mob the world has ever seen. [perhaps there is child porn as an ""attachment to John Podesta's email""]
* Our friendly neighborhood Intelligence Agency (CIA for example) then announces that careful forensic examination of the files proves them to be extremely sophisticated forgeries, such clever forgeries that only a ""State Player"" would have the financial resources technical capability to pull it off (Russia for example)
* Our own careful forensic examination eventually determines that the files have indeed been fucked with. Although MUCH of the incriminating CONTENT revealed in the files appears to be both true and authentic the SOURCES of the files have been altered (in a manner that only a real expert could detect) to make them appear to have come from ..... you guessed it ...... Russia.
* To make matters worse, SOME of the most outrageously salacious content ( the kind most likely to spread out through the internet social networks fastest and hottest ) are just straight up bullshit forgeries.
* The FORGED (false) documents will be the ones that our friendly neighborhood law enforcement agencies actually investigate, and of course the alleged crimes will be quickly PROVEN to be total frame-ups.
* These FALSELY alleged crimes, now exposed as total forgeries, will then be used to discredit  * ALL of the evidence in the 15,000 emails and 2 insurance files.
* The bad guys can now cast serious doubt on any and all crimes exposed in all of the documents.
* The good guys look like gullible assholes.
* CIA puts Hillary in the Whitehouse.
* Our job becomes infinitely more difficult, sifting the wheat from the chaff and being forced to find NEW evidence for everything, because the old evidence has been rendered pretty useless.
Is this scenario plausible ? 


There's only one other way that the political class could be in absolute checkmate right now, and that is if the leak clearly shows an ***identifiable politician*** on video raping a child. For example, if it is clearly Podesta in the video, then at that point nobody will care if Russia or whoever leaked it, nor can the political class use anything close to the exit strategies outlined above -- the crime would be so heinous it would spark rebellion. 

A response like ""but Russia leaked my pedophilia so we should attack Russia"" would not even be resorted to. ",conspiracy,Podesta

  The (((deep))) is deep, no matter who is President, who's the director of what department, who owns the house or senate, etc. A zebra doesn't change it's stripes. But to be clear on this, people like Trump are a curveball. Like Lincoln, Kennedy and Reagan before him. What you all need to remember when debating these crimes and cover-ups, is that the core ""establishments"" DNC AND RNC, are against him. You don't have to like Trump. You don't have to support him and you don't have to vote for him in 2020. It's not about Trump. This far proceeds him. Don't get caught up in the politics of it all because like your opinions, neither of them matter. We don't have ""parties"". We don't ""elect"" those who represent us. We don't have (and haven't for a VERY long time), the freedom of ""choice"". (((They))) just let us THINK we do to divide/control us.

They're not even capable of coming up with verifiable lies AND IT WON'T JUST CRIPPLE THE DEMS... roughly 20% of the GOP estab. will burn in flames. The delay is Trump's inability to execute to perfection as the estab. throws last ditch efforts to evade and prolong (like the **Flynn sacrifice, forcing Trump to sacrifice an innocent man, who'll be vindicated and reconfirmed by no later than Christmas**).

We'll, one could lead to the other if you think about it. **People are going to have to swallow some pretty big horse pills of pride. They'll feel dumb, duped, stupid, like they've been had, etc. many will still proceed to deny the reality they now can't avoid.** If the masses can't keep their shit together, by not running to their banks, selling all their stocks, making dumb decisions, etc, then things could escalate.

Not for nothing but this is literally WHY there are total transparency, isn't feasible or sustainable. Internally, the economy is what worries us most. The fall out could be devastating, but that said, it's time. It's time for the people to know the truth about a lot of things and not just us, the world.

Yes to some extent. But he may also be needed. He's basically being extorted in a good way. Worst thing Pbama actually did was run for President. He's unqualified as he's not a citizen. He knows. We know. They know... but we also have the docs. Hillary did too. She also literally ran his entire presidency. He was a planted puppet since 2008. He tried to pick up his balls after he won in 2012, but that didn't play so well, especially after Benghazi.

So if we ever needed to rationalize with the dems or calm their REEEEEs and keep civil order, we'd need someone big enough they couldn't deny or dispute. Enter Obama.

205,"Disputing Stephen Colbert's claims in his Youtube Pizzagate video, and showing how he intentionally misinforms the public PART 1",375.0,cw4z3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cw4z3b/disputing_stephen_colberts_claims_in_his_youtube/,145.0,1566914955.0,"So the top post in the sub right now is a claim that Podesta and Colbert are good friends, and that Colbert's Pizzagate video is number 1 for the search on Youtube. Frankly whether they are friends are not is irrelevant, but I read the comments of the post and people were asking why no one was debunking his claims, or showing how he is intentionally misinforming the public.  Here is a link to the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y)

00:00-01:05 - He begins slandering himself as not a proper ""news source"" while highlighting that you should only get your news through ""established"" media, mentioning CBS and the WallStreet Journal specifically. He says that you should never get any news from Social Media (the original news breakthrough for the West of the Amazon burning was locals on Social Media). He then creates the idea that media you receive from Social Media is ""Fake News"" and to lend credence to that claim he uses the Pope's quote ""Media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have morbid fascination with excrement."" However, the pope was talking about the very same media, who push fake narratives for political gain, he never mentions fake news from social media. This is what you call confirmation bias. Here is the actual quote:

""I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into – no offence intended – the sickness of coprophilia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true,” he said. “And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.

The means of communication have their own temptations, they can be tempted by slander, and therefore used to slander people, to smear them, this above all in the world of politics,” he said.

They can be used as means of defamation. No one has a right to do this. It is a sin and it is hurtful.”

01:05-02:05- Now that Colbert has established that Fake News is essentially the same as eating poop, he moves into his first claim regarding Pizzagate:

""And the craziest fake news of all is something called Pizzagate."" -The first line intentionally creates a narrative before evidence is even presented. The idea here is that you create a comparison that now lingers in your mind before even touching the actual subject. Now he presents the actual subject after comparing it to eating poop, whatever he is about to touch it is now ridiculous in the viewers mind.

""People actually believe a Conspiracy Theory that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring at a pizzeria in DC. This is a lie. \*insert joke\*""

The next line is the first time we see him intentionally misrepresent Pizzagate. Never was it implied that Hillary Clinton, nor John Podesta, ran a child sex ring. The latter's emails provided us with information. The original claim was, and still is: John Podesta is involved in pedophilia and sexual abuse, Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill associate themselves with people like this and may be involved in using their political powers to help those involved once the run into legal trouble- ie: Laura Silsby. The Pizzeria called Comet Ping-Pong was just a bi-product and most likely a safe haven for people to commit these types of acts, much like Epstein's private island..... never was it claimed a child sex ring was ran out of Comet PingPong nor that Podesta and Clinton were at the forefront. Being involved, or being a cog in the machine are massively different than running one.

""According to the people with spider eggs hatching in their brain""

Another example of this psychological technique (late shows are riddled with this technique), creates a narrative without evidence that sticks in your mind before anything is even delivered. The next statement must be ridiculous because these people are crazy with a bunch of spider eggs in their brain.""Clinton and Podesta have a series of smuggling tunnels that connect to the basement of the Pizzaeria, but police refuse to investigate the basement crime scene on the flimsy excuse that the pizzeria does not have a basement.""

Once again he uses the wrong names furthering his initial false claim. James Alefantis himself is the one who denies that Comet PingPong has a basement. However on April 16th 2015, in an interview from MetroWeekly James says he stores his organic tomatoes in his restaurant basement:

[https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/](https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/)

Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, store them in the basement, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in. - James Alefantis

People tried to claim that the basement he was referring to was his other restaurant, but storing 10 tons of tomatoes at another location that requires food storage itself is quite far-fetched. Not to mention that this interview was regarding Comet PingPong specifically. Why you would refer to it as ""the basement"" when talking about your restaurant that the question is asking about, when you meant a different basement a block away is curious to say the least.

02:05-03:05- He now has my favourite line in the whole video:

""So where did this Conspiracy Theory start? Apparently some Alt-Right folks were combing through Clinton campaign emails, hacked by Russia and published by Wikileaks and noticed there seemed to be more references to pizza and pizzerias than people expected. Which can only mean one thing: child sex rings.""

Wow, keep in mind this was long before there was any real evidence it was Russia, no investigation or anything. He purposely misrepresents where it starts. It was personal emails written by Podesta which began the investigation. When certain words were used out of context. Like this email titled ""Cheese""[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613)

\> Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?

If you were sending your good friends a gift, that was normal and legal, why would you have a strategy that required certain steps to adhere to in order for your friends not to be concerned. Who needs a strategy to send cheese or pasta. Furthermore, why would you play a game like dominoes on a surface that would not balance the dominoes themselves. These were the types of emails that caused the initial interest, and people began searching the terms ""Pizza, Cheese, Pasta"" and began digging when they were constructed like this.

That's it for part one. I'll be sure to post Part 2 tomorrow.

Edit: I've noticed this post is under serious bombardment from accounts that appear like they are one of the researchers. They will often present misinformation as evidence to further discredit the investigation. This technique is called Black Propaganda. More on the entire investigation here:

Gee, with Obama's $65,000 in pizza and hotdogs being flown in from Chicago and all these handmade tortillas being flown in from Mexico there is certainly a lot of ""flying around"" of food, isn't there?

The ""you should bring all children that are available"" comment is very strange as well. Not ""kids are welcome"".

I've been in Texas (from UK), and you can get fresh tortillas at nearly every restaurant and grocery stores (still hot, or made on the other side of the restaurant moments before). Tortillas are a mixture of flour and water or cornmeal and water with very little else besides lard. You don't freaking FLY tortillas anywhere so it is INCREDIBLY absurd. They could more easily hire a tortilla maker to come to their party and make them right there along with that entire roasted whole pig. Besides Podesta is a ""foodie."" He surely knows this...

Also a cookout, with a suckling pig, in winter? Also because of the water issues in Mexico it would not be ideal to fly perishable food like that.",conspiracy,Podesta

On February 4th, 2017, Wikileaks posted a very strange Tweet, and they have continued to release one (with the hashtag #Vault7) daily since then (through today, Feb. 9th, 2017).

First, [here](https://postimg.org/gallery/2088uhz6q/) is a gallery containing all of the images.

Now on to each individual post:

[**What is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65ad71655.jpg) Posted Feb. 4th, 2017. A picture of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen near Longyearbyen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago, about 810 miles from the North Pole.

[**Where is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65aebfe9f.jpg) Posted Feb. 6th, 2017. A picture of the Merkers salt mine. Merkers-Kieselbach is a former municipality in the Wartburgkreis district of Thuringia, Germany. The Merkers area of the municipality is famous for its salt mine, which is now exploited as the Merkers Adventure Mines visitor attraction. Here large amounts of Nazi gold, and many stolen works of art were discovered by the United States Army in 1945. General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself went into the mine in April 1945 in order to examine the find.

[**Who is #Vault7? -**](https://i.imgsafe.org/b65af1b823.jpg) Posted Feb. 7th, 2017. A picture of Chelsea/Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden. Three extremely famous whistle-blowers.

*Chelsea Elizabeth Manning* (born Bradley Edward Manning, December 17, 1987) is a United States Army soldier who was convicted by court-martial in July 2013, of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses, after disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly three-quarters of a million classified, or unclassified but sensitive, military and diplomatic documents. Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years' imprisonment, with the possibility of parole in the eighth year, and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army. On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted all but four months of Manning's remaining sentence; she is scheduled to be released on May 17, 2017.

*Julian Paul Assange* (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, which he founded in 2006. He has won numerous accolades for journalism, including the Sam Adams Award and Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 but came to global prominence in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks, provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. In November 2010, a request was made for Assange's extradition to Sweden, where he had been questioned months earlier over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Assange continued to deny the allegations, and expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States due to his perceived role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered himself to UK police on 7 December 2010 and was held for ten days in solitary confinement before being released on bail. Assange sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. Assange has since remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, and is unable to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions. In 2016, WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and the Podesta emails during the United States presidential election, 2016.

*Edward Joseph Snowden* (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.

[**How did #Vault7 make its way to WikiLeaks? -**](http://i.imgsafe.org/c9039166e3.jpg) Posted Feb. 9th, 2017. A picture showing Stasi surveillance of mailboxes in Berlin. When mailboxes were being observed by Stasi agents, every person posting a letter was photographed. Some films found in the Stasi archives also show persons dressed in civilian clothing emptying the mailbox after the conclusion of the surveillance action. Mass surveillance in East Germany was a widespread practice throughout the country's history, involving Soviet, East German, and Western agencies. On 8 February 1950, East Germany saw the establishment of the Ministry for State Security (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit), commonly known as the Stasi. The Stasi sought to ""know everything about everyone"". Its annual budget has been estimated at approximately $1 billion. Out of a population of 16 million, the agency kept files on nearly 6 million of its citizens. The Stasi had 90,000 full-time employees who were assisted by 170,000 full-time unofficial collaborators (Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter); together these made up 1 in 63 (nearly 2%) of the entire East German population. Together with these, a much larger number of occasional informers brought up the total to 1 per 6.5 persons. People in East Germany were subjected to a variety of techniques, including audio and video surveillance of their homes, reading mail, extortion, and bribery.",conspiracy,Podesta

Or Thanks or Tom Hanks has been Infecting just about just about every “fringe” event of sub-series of conspiracy communities. With all the hoopla surrounding him currently I wanted do dive back a couple years to some of the down right ODD things in connection with Mr Hanks.    


From the top I will mention the various point where Tom or connected parties showed up in the particular research I was doing.     
    
  First big series of hanks sync weaving was to do when I was researching the Mandela effect and the prominent position Hanks has as a Nexus of effects.      
    
  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an\_exercise\_followed\_by\_examples\_word\_association/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an_exercise_followed_by_examples_word_association/)    
    
  If you are unfamiliar with the Mandela effect then essentially is a a series of pop culture points that have been altered or a wide collection of people have noticed a change from their memory of a particular specific point.   


Weather or not it is faulty human memory or something else is up for debate but what is not up for debate is the rampant and creative ways the Mandela effects connect to Tom Hanks.     
    
  I made this post as a way of explaining how to play with words and symbolism, ways of looking at things as a puzzle.   


Here is a bit of what that looks like.     


Mandel means Almond, An almond is the Mandorla, Mandelas prisoner number is 46664 but used to be 4664 according to some. Cern is said to be responsible or at least involved in some way and their video “Happy” Has Both Nelson Mandela and 4664 (the occluded Prisoner number) Cerns logo has the 666 theme as well as being Mandela effected as well and the effect added a mandorla. Cern built the WWW or 666 vav vav vav 777/ which is also the Monster energy drink logo. LOGOS changing LOGOS is the WORD and the thing that was with God during creation. The levels of fractal metaphor are stunning to me. Staggeringly beautiful not just in their existence but the fact that conscious minds can behold it.   
    
   Isnt it funny that Jaws (villian) and Jaws(shark) are both to do with The mouth and teeth and the ME involves braces... And that the dolly/jaws scene had them mirror each others smiles, like in snow whites mirror mirror. and that the actress who plays dolly is Blanche Ravelec. Blanche means White/pure. As does Clarice In the Silence of the lions/lamb.... loins fruit of the womb. froot looms loony looms..... the double 00 thing oo like eyes that see.  

  
   Sally fields name is effected, her famous Oscar speech is effected, she costars in forest gump which has curious George as a key element and sally field being the one Tom hanks is quoting, he would then be involved in another ME later on. And sally fields brother works at cern... Tom hank is also Woody and Says “Theirs a Snake in my Boots” which contextually makes no sense and reminds us of the Fields not having a plural.. Another way to look at that is “Boots” could be interpreted as a word.. and the Snake is S s is a snake a snake hissessssss los of ssess lol The s on the end can also denote possession (again more S'es) possession is ownership and ownership is shackling and oppressive. You may also be reminded of Field of Dreams “If you build it THEY/HE will come (who is he?) HE is right in the middle of THEY TY thank you... and back to the start with the fact sally fields acceptance speech was her saying thank you to the academy.  


  
   This may appear to be nonsense or gibberish but if you had the time and knew the things I was referencing then you would be able to see the connections.   


Of Course this is just nothing as it is. But then the universe nods to us this genuine morsel.

Here is a point of note. I am browsing this wiki for the first time and I am seeing this nugget.  


Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [Cante dei Gabrielli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cante_dei_Gabrielli) da [Gubbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubbio)  was appointed [*podestà*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podest%C3%A0) of the city.

Podesta really..... I had no idea this name meant anything, really never looked into it, even though I have an obsession with names and the meanings of said names, I had not sought this.   


Ok I seem to be diving into other trails in this Warren of rabbit holes.     
    
    
  Back too Event 201 and Tom hanks game with Rita Wilson where 6 games in is ahead 201 points.     


[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)    


What is this? 6201.................... 6 games 201 points...... bill signed into law the day you and Rita Wilson tested positive for corona virus in Australia with your CORONA typewriter?   
    
  So we have a grand convergence of coincidence. 1 with event 201 coming before HR 6201 is passed and 2 with the rummy game hanks played with his wife referencing said bill.

I searched for Tom hanks and found this post from r/Typewriters and its simply an autographed Typewriter but altogether a nod that Im on the right path.

Babaloo Mandel? Baloo and Mandel, for real? Mandel like the Mandel effect and the Mandela effect. And Baloo like the character from the jungle book who is not wearing coconuts as a bra anymore?  


Look up “Baloo Mandela effect” and you'll see what I mean.  


This stood out too me because of course Tom hanks connection too the Mandela effect through notably the Most Mandela effects attributed to his name and works. But I didn't think it was 'Enough” to share here.   


So after seeing Madonna and Tom hanks connected via the Corona Typewriter I googled . “Tom Hanks and Madonna”  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_League\_of\_Their\_Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_League_of_Their_Own)    


OK so the other film by Babaloo Mandel that stood out as another Tom hanks flick was this movie .   


Im getting long winded and as always there is more left out then I have presented it too you as their really is no way of condensing this so that you acquire the full picture.   


I end with a question?!!!   


What was Madonnas name before she changed it too MADONNA for the purposes of being a star?

Well that's not actually the end because we need to wrap this baby up in swaddling clothes.

Tom hanks wife is Rita Wilson...................... Wilson you say?! Hmmm well the vollyball in CAST AWAY must have been named after her... right????   
    
   In the film, Wilson the [volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)) serves as Chuck Noland's [personifie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification)d [friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend) and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island). Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, [Wilson Sporting Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Sporting_Goods), the character was created by screenwriter [William Broyles, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Broyles,_Jr.) While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the [Gulf of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California), to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation    
     
   Here is a prime example of synchronicity that when brought up to someone not exposed to these ideas they would come back at you with “Well its prolly because his wife was named Wilson” and then the door is shut for them they don't have to take on any new ideas or modify there existing foundation of reality.  If you tell anyone a small peculiar fact then they inevitably try and “Solve” what you just told them. They have to organize the new information in a way that doesn't cause uncomfortability or stress. The human brain seems to have an Autonomic response to new information that doesn't jive with the world view that person has built up over the years.    
     
   Mention any Mandela effect and someone will try and come up with a reason to ignore what you are presenting to them. The effects themselves are in such mundane places that it doesn't seem to have much weight to the average Joe.    
     
   It seems like many people fall into the logical fallacy of the “Wisdom of the Crowd” Even if they have no concept of what this is they may still fall into its tenants.    
     
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)    
     
   Take any of the biggest conspiracies out there. The moon landing, 9-11, flat earth. The bigger and more wide spanning the conspiracy then the more “Well, if this is real then people would have said something about it” “You couldn't keep a secret that big” “Somebody in my life would have told me if X was True/False.”    
   Have you seen the meme from xfiles with the poster Mulder has saying “I want to believe” with a flying saucer on it. Thats what this is like. But the train goes both ways. “I want” and “I dont want. “    
     
   [https://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Poster-Believe-Official-24x36/dp/B003V1IU3O/ref=asc\_df\_B003V1IU3O/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61981387152&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101](https://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Poster-Believe-Official-24x36/dp/B003V1IU3O/ref=asc_df_B003V1IU3O/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61981387152&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309733593834&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8924062892720319746&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010924&hvtargid=pla-571329128101)    
     
   Both of these Mantras play out in our heads unbeknownst to our recognition. A duel play on what we wish reality to be and what we wish it not to be. As want and unwant are dualistic sides of the same coin.  For someone that believes 9-11 was an inside job. “I want to believe” that I among all these other people on this planet found out that this large sector of society has been duped and I am one of the few people smart enough to have figured it out.    
     
   For someone who thinks 9-11 conspiracy theorists are insane. “ I dont want to believe I have been duped by the establishment and that everything I have been taught and all the people that I love have been duped into believing an untruth.”    
     
   I think this is mainly something that stems from our human need for others to identify with and a tribe to call home. And to have our beliefs echoed by another group. To be acknowledged as a contributor to the paradigm and to feel validated by others that feel the same way.    
     
   Its like we are innately narcissistic creatures who love our own images. We find those most similar to us and we just stare at each other reflecting the same ideas and producing a greater dived between US and THEM.What it comes down to is life's great mystery. Which takes shape in questions we ask ourselves:  ” Why do I exist?” “Why is reality a thing instead of a non-thing?” “What is my purpose?”    
     
   Instead of “what is my purpose?” it becomes “Is there even a purpose?”    
     
   Mainstream elements give us Relativity, The Big Bang, and Evolution.    
     
   If a human delves into and absorbs these tenants of culture, then one may come to the conclusion that reality is the result of a freak accident of random number of infinite forces coming together and creating everything you know and love and think and do. That it is all a fluke and you are just lucky..... but luck doesn't exist because this is a random universe and nothing lies deeper than surface exploration.    
     
   To identify Self you must also have the Other. The contrast creates the existence of a thing.Imagine 2 worlds, one of infinite shadow and one of infinite light. The one of infinite shadow would be a black slate and the world of light a white slate. Without contrast everything is nothing. Sense without the lack of sense is Nonsense. A world of pure sound or silence is a world where sound isn't a thing that exists.  If you ask the question. “What is a thing” the answer would be the inverse of its opposite. What is an exhale. It is the inverse of an inhale. But what is that? It is a see saw..... seeing and after seeing sawing. SAW because it WAS. Its like pIng pOng In and Out IO overlapped is the symbol for power. On/Off.  Imagine a hero without a villain. The story of Batman is a prime example of the balancing force of the universe. Without the Joker he would have never experienced the trauma to become the batman, its very possible that if the joker had not killed his parents that he would not have had fear in the cave with the bats. Joker was the primeval creation force alchemizing the batman into existence.    
     
   And then you ask would the Joker have done what he did if he didn't have a nemesis to combat against... a force to emphasize his existence    
     
   This reality/ game seems like a puzzle of disCERNment. That the presence of so many untruths shows us the massive amounts of truths that can be yielded. The shadows can show us where the light lies.

  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s\_Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)   


The book is a story of a dystopian future where children are raised on video games and are chosen based on their aptitude to be brought into the military and as a part of their training they do a series of “Wargames”  via simulations systems and Haptic feedback suits for realism. SPOILER ALERT! The simulations they were performing were actual drone battle missions where they were killing actual sentient creatures.     


The psychology of getting kids to perform against actual foes with the knowledge that it was all a game made them more proficient in their duty to kill.    


Ok lets reel it back for a     
    
  TLDR.   
    
  Tom hanks is involved or a focal point in the Mandela effect phenomenon present in Forrest Gump Life is/.was like a box of chocolates, Apollo 13 Houston we have/we've had a problem, Woody from toy story says “There's a snake in my boot/s ,Momma from Forrest Gump is played by sally field/s whose name is considered a Mandela effect and has a famous Oscar speech that is commonly attributed to the Mandela effect and Sally Fields brother in real life is a scientist at CERN. CERN  makes a video set too Pharrells Happy that is filmed at Cern and a scientist holds up signs saying Bond# (Barry Nelson) and Mandela underneath, also showing the number 4664     
    
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46664)    
    
  Tom hanks then turns CERN back on after a failure that had occurred. He did this in honor of a movie Angels and Demons whos sequel INFERNO has Hanks catch a virus set to be a worldwide pandemic for the purposes of population control for the greater good. In Nov of 2019 one month before the first documented case of Novel Coronavirus Event 201 is hosted in  NYC by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. And on 3-11-2020 the same day Hanks and Rita announce they are infected with Corona virus, after bringing a Corona typewriter all the way to Australia. Then Hanks announces his wife's score of 6 games 201 points. When 6201 if you google it will get you one thing.  


[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201)   


Hanks is called out in a video also calling out Epstein and others involved in the underground trafficking of children, This person is then killed/died/epstiened on route 66 which Tom hanks Tweets about.   


There is some funky stuff going on in the world and to be blunt there are 3 options. And then variations between those 3 options.   
    
  The extremes are   


1. This is all orchestrated and everything presented through the public is controlled/filtered and dispensed with one purpose. All news media and things that people talk about are intricately put together to share some underlying puzzle.  


Ways this could be feasible: this is a simulation and everything is preordained and put in place with no free will to the occupants in the simulation.   


Ways it couldn't be feasible. Barring a simulation it just would not cut it to have any sort of person or group in charge of such a thing, its too well orchestrated for human hands.   


I suppose a god of the realm in control of such things could perform such a feat..... but why?  


2. This is all the universe playing a coincidence game, a red herring game of sorts to keep some busy and others asleep.  Like if Tom hanks really got the itch to bring his Corona typewriter and he and his wife did actually play games of Gin Rummy that resulted in the 6 games 201 points with Event 201 being finished and HR 6201 just passing the same day they are infected with coronavirus.   


This is just one facet of the coincidental underlying tapestry that paints itself underneath human activity.   


Within this post I detail some stellar findings/coincidences that bear repeating here.

What are the odds that Wilson the volleyball is not named after Rita Wilson, his wife who kept her last name. But is instead named because the Writer stranded himself on an island and a Wilson Volleyball washed up onshore. This is the type of coincidence that bars any human forethought or knowledge to arranging. One of those universal winks in the form of syncs.   
    
    
  Look for my post history and you will find hundreds of WTF how is this a coincidence facts that could be both coincidence/divine providence/ or the will of man.  


Oh yeah and the 3rd Extreme way of looking at this data I have presented here and in the past is to just shut the door and say.  


“Nothing” none of this means anything at all and you are just thinking too much or looking too deep.   


The most likely is a synergy of these 3 points. There maybe a controlling organization or AI program controlling the media and news, film and music.  But there is most likely a clever universal side of things projecting the ironic in these peculiar times. And im sure some of this is just digging to deep as everything is intrinsically connected .

1,Former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta has backed efforts to get the Electoral College voters an intelligence briefing on Russia's alleged interference in the election. What are the possible outcomes of this?,274.0,5hybqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5hybqf/former_clinton_campaign_chairman_john_podesta_has/,995.0,1481567986.0,"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/clinton-campaign-backs-call-for-intelligence-briefing-before-electoral-college-vote-232512

>“The bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,” Podesta said in a statement Monday. “Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed. Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,” he said. “Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.”

2,"Assuming that Russia hacked the DNC and/or others with the intent of influencing the election, what should Trump do about it?

Assuming that this is true, what should Trump do about it?  In particular, what would liberals / Democrats want him to do about it? 

Is it just a matter of getting Trump to acknowledge that the hacking occurred?  Is that the goal here?  If Trump came out and said ""Yes, Russia hacked us, and that's very bad, and we should try to prevent it next time"" would that be a sufficient response? Or is Trump expected to punish Russia in some way, possibly sanctions?  

As an aside, are the reports true regarding John Podesta's email password being something like ""password""?  If so, doesn't he deserve some of the blame for making it extremely easy for another country to compromise our election?  To me, it's kind of analogous to someone who leaves the keys in the ignition and the car running every time they park.  Eventually, their car will get stolen.  Yes, the car thief should be fully punished, but the owner of the car was also acting irresponsibly and should change their behavior.  This is especially true when the stolen ""car"" is not just personal property but instead is a democratic election that affects an entire country. ",PoliticalDiscussion,Podesta
3,How often do journalists behave like this?,25.0,8p4su1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/8p4su1/how_often_do_journalists_behave_like_this/,58.0,1528322447.0,"While I was looking through some emails Wikileaks claimed 'expose collusion' between Clinton 2016 campaign and US media (spoiler alert - they really don't) I uncovered this email, which even Wikileaks seemed to ignore:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3173
Essentially, it seems that Clinton campaign press secretary Jennifer Palmieri  was angry about previous New York Times coverage, so they insisted that NYT piece about Clinton's policy proposals includes some details and caveats provided by her campaign. So far, so good. Then she sees that they warned NYT about 'further setbacks' in the relationship if the piece was 'unfair'. This is less than ideal, but, hey, it's their right to stop giving privileged access to new information to the NYT, if they feel they're not being covered fairly. It's worth noting that around this time NYT was publishing stories about Uranium One and covering 'Clinton Cash' in multiple articles. Complaining about negative coverage is also nothing new - Wikileaks also (perhaps unwittingly) reveals that Michael Bloomberg had a coffee wiith NYT editor in chief to object about his own problems with the newspaper. But the last part bugs me the most. In it, Palmieri writes : 'She (Maggie) is going to read me the story later today off the record to further assure me.' 'Maggie' is Maggie Haberman, who was then starting her career in the NYT, previously writing for Politico. Clinton campaign memo describes her as a 'friendly journalist who we had tee up stories for us and who never disappointed us before'. Now, that Clinton's staff thinks about her this way is obviously not Haberman's fault. But I am not so sure about reading articles in advance. This is generally not done, as far as I understand. Granted, this is about Clinton's policy proposals, but still, it seems unnecessary and unprofessional. This is the article she published the next day:
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/politics/hillary-clinton-economic-agenda-aims-at-a-party-moving-left.html
It's not glowing praise of Hillary, that's for sure. It's also not scathing criticism, so why were they making such a fuss about it in the first place? Anyway, Haberman won a Pulitzer this year for covering Trump ties with Russia, so I would hope this is not something she regularly does, because it is unworthy of a top journalist like her. There is nothing similar to this in the rest of the emails, so it does seem it was a one-off. So, two questions for those knowledgeable with political journalism:
1) Do you agree with my analysis?
2) How often do journalists do this kind of stuff? Is it accepted as OK, or is it to be avoided at all costs?
Thanks!",PoliticalDiscussion,Podesta

> POTUS in Peru says his brief chat w Putin did not include alleged Russian intervention in US election because ""that's behind us."" 

We have spent the better part of the last few months dealing with the various accusations that Russian meddled in this Presidential election, via the DNC server hacks / leaks, as well as accessing John Podesta's Gmail account and providing the emails to Wikileaks.  

Many on team Clinton felt Wikileaks was an arm of the Russian government, and that 17 Intelligence agencies all but confirmed Russia was behind the hacks.  Many on team Trump (and I would argue those on neither team...team Stein/Johnson) felt the U.S. government, as well as the Clinton campaign, were red baiting the public.  

Any foreign interference in an election, especially an American election, is a horrible thing..especially if a desired result is being attempting to manipulate. Regardless of the result, if proof was determined a foreign government was trying to rig an election, there would be consequences, yes?  

So why would our President make a comment like **""that's behind us""**?  Almost the entire political establishment, the media, and almost 50% of eligible voters did not want Donald Trump as President...and said ""Russian hacking"" was at the cornerstone of daily and weekly accusations during the end of the Primary and General Election.  Now that the results played out to everyone's surprise, it's ""behind us""? 

I am one of those individuals who felt the Russian connection was very weak and loose, and the democrats were using it as a red baiting tactic to use fear in voting against Donald Trump. I, myself, did not vote for him. But if any of the accusations were true or accurate, I would fully expect our President and government to push forth in retaliation or at minimum an actual investigation. 

So Barack Obama's comment certainly stands out as odd for me.",PoliticalDiscussion,Podesta
5,Does the recently leaked Clinton/Podesta email that appears to confirm Saudi support of ISIS prove this theory more than any evidence we've had before?,17.0,57r4w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/57r4w9/does_the_recently_leaked_clintonpodesta_email/,95.0,1476619686.0,"There have been theories about the Saudi government (as opposed to just random wealthy Saudis) supporting ISIS for a while, but I don't know if there was ever any hard evidence for it. However, recently Wikileaks published the following email:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774

In which Hillary Clinton (presumably) writes:

>we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.

Is this email better evidence for the theory of Saudi government support of ISIS than what we (those of us outside the intelligence/defense community, in any case) had before it came out?

My take on the matter is that, if it *is* indeed known as a fact in the US defense/intelligence community that the Saudi government has supported ISIS, it is rather insulting and suspicious that this fact is not part of the official narrative about Middle Eastern events which that community gives out for public consumption, especially given US arms deals with Saudi Arabia and US support for the Saudi war in Yemen.",PoliticalDiscussion,Podesta

How do you prepare? 

TLDR:- Presume the Clinton campaign know there is a really bad email within The Podesta leaks but yet to be released, how do you prepare? 

 

For fun a few ideas of potential of emails:

1) The email directly implicates Hillary in genuinely fixing the Primary against Sanders 

2) The email unequivocally shows quid-pro-quo between Clinton foundation donors and Hillarys state department.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

5,Megathread: Trump ex-campaign chief Manafort to help Russia inquiry in plea deal,27374.0,9ftbt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9ftbt1/megathread_trump_excampaign_chief_manafort_to/,7465.0,1536941436.0,"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has agreed to co-operate with an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as part of a plea deal.

In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose banks accounts.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

7,"If you say you are ""The Most Transparent Candidate"" while constantly obfuscating data, what does that say about your integrity?",8619.0,4e0vo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4e0vo6/if_you_say_you_are_the_most_transparent_candidate/,1165.0,1460199883.0,"Mrs Clinton not too long ago stated that she was [The Most Transparent Candidate in modern times] (http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/271879-clinton-im-most-transparent-public-official-in-modern). But what does she really mean by this? 

When we look at how she gets her money there are no real clear answers. In fact we have to dig to find anything, but we find that Hillary Clinton is no stranger to the Corporate interest groups and lobbyist. 

We know that she receives donations from [Oil Companies / Oil Company Lobbyist ]( http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/oil-companies-donated-clinton-foundation-while-lobbying-state-department-2348832) 

[It's not a Lie, Fossil Fuel Investors Are Pumping Millions of Dollars Into Hillary Clinton's Campaign](https://news.vice.com/article/fossil-fuel-investors-are-pumping-millions-of-dollars-into-hillary-clintons-campaign)

We also know that Hillary’s Clinton Foundation received money from [Atomic Energy companies as well](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-gained-us-uranium-assets). Uranium One in three separate transactions after being purchased by a Russian atomic-energy agency, Rosatom from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons. Soon after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

We now know that [Egyptian Companies and Government Entities](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clintons-state-department-increased-chemical-arms-sales-middle-east-countries-1949653)   gave money to the Clinton Foundation while Her State Department cleared Egypt to continue purchasing arms the U.S. government classified as toxicological agents, a broad designation that included chemical and biological weapons. Once in 2010, Mubarak government paid Bill Clinton a $250,000 speaking, less than 4 months before the Egyptian revolution began , And again  in 2012, a firm with an ownership stake in the company that manufactured the tear gas reportedly used by Egyptian security forces against the protesters paid $100,000 to $250,000 for another Bill Clinton speech.

Clinton’s massive campaign machine is built and fueled from the very thing — super PACs, secret cash, unlimited contributions — she says she’ll attack once she wins the White House.
How is it that Clinton still claims that she is “THE MOST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATE IN MODERN TIMES” when her Foundation [Failed to Disclose 1,100 Foreign Donations](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-29/clinton-foundation-failed-to-disclose-1-100-foreign-donations)  . And this is on top of Clinton's Failure once again to disclose more than $26,000,000  in speaking fees [""from foreign governments and corporations"" ]( http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/politics/clinton-foundation-speech-income/index.html)  Because you know….“That’s what they offered”.

In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187) Just two months before a deal with Boeing to make warplanes was finalized with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [Boeing donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/boeing-gave-to-clinton-causes-after-hillary-steered-its-russian-contract/article/2563994)

The Hillary Clinton campaign and Foundation have been raking in cash from Banks that have [admitted Wrongdoing](http://www.ibtimes.com/clintons-foundation-raked-cash-banks-admitted-wrongdoing-2010404). So once again we see here that Hillary does not mind muddying the waters, Saying that she will be hard on these banking institutions while taking more money from these banking institutions that any normal person could ever hope to make in a lifetime. 

Then there is that added issue of the [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/), and  the issue of Clintons Foundation and Campaign connection to it and the vast array of institutions caught in this scandal. In lobbying for the Panama-United States Trade Promotion Agreement, Clinton paved the way for major banks and corporations, most notably the Deutsche Bank, to skirt national laws and regulations.  Once she resigned as the Secretary of State, the Deutsche Bank paid her $485,000 for a speech. While criminality can’t yet be definitively established, this may change when the “Süddeutsche Zeitung” publishes its comprehensive list at the end of the month. In addition to the aforementioned connection, Clinton’s name has already surfaced in connection to a billionaire and a Russian-controlled bank named in the files. Which I imagine is a connection to the Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony Podesta, a major Clinton bundler. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which first reported the connection, Sberbank registered with the Podesta Group last month to lobby on issues related to economic sanctions against Russia and on stock and bond trading for its U.S. clients.

**EDIT 4:** for those who keep telling me that Hillary has always supported the LGTB crowd. 

We can blame Bill Clinton for the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. Clinton defended her husband’s Sept. 21, 1996 signing of the bill.

This is where Hillary Clinton said that [she does not support Gay Marriage / Civil Unions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZkK2_6H9MM)

This is where Hillary Clinton Said that [she believes that Marriage is only between a man and a woman in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I)

Senator Sanders has been a longtime supporter of LGBT rights. In 1983, during his first term as Mayor of Burlington, Sen. Sanders supported the city’s first ever Pride Parade. He later signed a city ordinance banning housing discrimination.

When he served in the House of Representatives, then-Congressman Sanders voted against “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 1993 and the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act” in 1996. Sen. Sanders hailed the landmark Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2015 which struck down DOMA and recognized same-sex marriage is a right in all 50 states, calling the decisions a “victory for same-sex couples across our country as well as all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded equal rights.”

FBI Director James Comey has announced that the Bureau has discovered new emails that they believe pertinent to their previously closed investigation into fmr. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her use thereof.

*****

**Text of the memo from Director Comey to Congress**

> In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

> In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether the contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

> Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete the additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

*****

**Statements from Secretary Clinton at a short press conference Friday evening**

> We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes.  Voting is already underway in our country, so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.

>So we don't know the facts, which is why we are calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has.  Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let's get it out.


> We’ve heard these rumors.  We don’t know what to believe. And I'm sure there will be even more rumors. That’s why it’s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they're talking about.  Your guess is as good as mine and I don't think that’s not good enough.

Lobbyists were already calling her presidential bid ""inevitable"" and retooling Democratic PACs to back her.

> Lawyers and lobbyists gave more than $18 million in campaign contributions to Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

> Elmendorf is among a number of prominent fundraisers on K Street who could help build a Clinton machine. Tony Podesta, chairman of Podesta Group, is another campaign rainmaker who is expected to support her if she runs.

> In addition, a number of lobbyists and consultants have already taken formal positions with the “shadow campaign” that is being waged in Clinton’s name.

> In January, Priorities USA Action announced that Jonathan Mantz of BGR Group would become a senior adviser. The super-PAC, which was created for President Obama’s reelection campaign, is retooling in anticipation of a Clinton bid.

> Mantz was the national finance director for Clinton’s 2008 campaign. Jay Dunn, a senior managing director for FTI Consulting, was Mantz’s deputy in 2008, and lobbyists consider him a likely Clinton backer in 2016.

> Another prominent K Street supporter is former Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif.), who is an adviser to the super-PAC Ready for Hillary, which is already on the ground in primary states like Iowa and South Carolina.

> “She [Clinton] is perhaps inevitable because of her enormous skills and experience. … Only she can make the decision, and she hasn’t yet. So we will just have to wait and see, but for many of us, she’s the one,” said Tauscher, who was undersecretary for arms control at the State Department with Clinton.",politics,Podesta

\**Note to the Bernie Sanders campaign*\*

Vet your vetting team.

At least two high level Sanders staff have ties to initiatives run and advised by current and former Clinton acolytes.   Aisha Dew and Joe Caiazzo of the Sanders campaign were both accused independently of sabotage in their own regions.  Allegations were raised over the past month from staff and volunteers under these people.

The Truman National Security Project is behind The Trans Pacific Partnership, which Sanders is against.

Recently The Truman National Security Project **attempted to scrub Aisha Dew and Joe Caiazzo** from its website by locking profiles to hide affiliation. {[1](http://trumanproject.org/home/team-view/aisha-dew/)}{[2](http://trumanproject.org/home/team-view/joe-caiazzo/)}

**Other info**

On Jan 9, 2013, ""The Truman National Security Project"" merged with ""Center for American Progress"" (founded by John Podesta)  
The Center for American Progress is part of The Democracy Alliance.

**What is the Democracy Alliance?**

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html

> A year after its founding, Democracy Alliance has followed up on its pledge to become a major power in the liberal movement. It has lavished millions on groups that have been **willing to submit to its extensive screening process and its demands for secrecy**.

> **These include the Center for American Progress**, a think tank with an unabashed partisan edge, as well as Media Matters for America, which tracks what it sees as conservative bias in the news media. Several alliance donors are negotiating a major investment in Air America, a liberal talk-radio network.

> Democracy Alliance was formed last year with **major backing from billionaires such as financier George Soros and Colorado software entrepreneur Tim Gill**. The inspiration, according to founders, was a belief that Democrats became the minority party in part because liberals do not have a well-funded network of policy shops, watchdog groups and training centers for activists equivalent to what has existed for years on the right.

> ""Everything we invest in should have not just short-term impact but long-term impact and sustainability,"" she said. The group requires nondisclosure agreements because many donors prefer anonymity, Wade added. Some donors expressed concern about being attacked on the Web or elsewhere for their political stance; others did not want to be targeted by fundraisers.

> ""Like a lot of elite groups, we fly beneath the radar,"" said Guy Saperstein, an Oakland lawyer and alliance donor. But ""we are not so stupid though,"" he said, to think ""we can deny our existence.""

> Those who make the cut have prospered. **The Center for American Progress (CAP), which is led by former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta, received $5 million in the first round** because it was seen as a liberal version of the Heritage Foundation, which blossomed as a conservative idea shop in the Reagan years, said one person closely familiar with alliance operations. CAP officials declined to comment.

> **The exclusive donor club includes millionaires such as Susie Tompkins Buell and her husband, Mark Buell, major backers of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)**, and Chris Gabrieli, an investment banker running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts this September. Mark Buell estimated that about 70 percent of alliance partners built their own wealth, while 30 percent became wealthy through inheritances.

**What about this billionaire George Soros guy?**

Soros tied to both the Democracy Alliance, Hillary's SuperPAC, and Move-on?  interesting.  
Move-on is behind scheduling and co-ordination of protests that is giving Bernie's campaign a bad name.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/hillary-clinton-george-soros-218494

> George Soros donates $8 million to boost Hillary

> The massive check brings to $8 million the Hungarian-born investor's total 2015 giving to pro-Clinton groups.

> The super PAC that received the $6-million check, Priorities USA Action, raised $25 million in the second half of 2015, according to a report it filed Sunday evening with the Federal Election Commission. The haul brings the PAC’s tally to $41 million for the year, and left it with a strong $36 million in the bank headed into the year.

Soros has previously funded McCain via the Reform Institute.
http://www.wnd.com/2008/02/56177/

Soros also funds a number of left wing media outlets, including Center for American Progress and Think Progress.

Both George Soros and John McCain are members of the Council on Foreign Relations whose agenda is to undermine National Sovereignty in favor of large multinational Corporate interests.

John Podesta was CEO of Center for American Progress before Obama formally brought him into his White House Staff to lead his NSA (non) review.

The review of the NSA will be heavily influenced by George Soros via his close connections to John Podesta.

In 1998 Podesta became President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff in the second Clinton Administration and executed the position until the end of Clinton's time in office in January 2001. He had a key role in introducing Executive Order 12958 which led to an unprecedented effort to declassify millions of pages from the U.S. diplomatic and national security history and also oversaw Clinton's pardons in the last days of his administration.

Presumably John Podesta has also been brought into the White House fold to smooth the path for Hillary Clinton's presidential run in 2016.

Hillary Clinton has just taken a $400,000 bribe from Goldman Sachs to fund her campaign. 
Goldman Sachs will be expecting to be paid back - with buckets of interest.

Hillary Clinton Tells Wall Street She Believes Anti-Wall Street Rhetoric ‘Foolish’

Here we go again. According to a piece in Politico Magazine former Secretary of State and likely 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had some harsh words related to progressives in her $400,000 speeches for Goldman Sachs and friends. Clinton decided to use her speaking opportunity before the super rich to attack those criticizing Wall Street and its numerous criminal practices.

Ordinarily these masters of the universe might have groaned at the idea of a politician taking the microphone…

But Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring, according to accounts offered by several attendees, declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish.

0,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,92.0,5bgwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/,15.0,1478453724.0,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Hackers Broke Into John Podesta and Colin Powell’s Gmail Accounts](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-hackers-broke-into-john-podesta-and-colin-powells-gmail-accounts)

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>---

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>---

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

He frequently re-tweets WikiLeaks, just like DCLeaks. He re-tweets and follows conspiracy theory outlets like Alex Jones and Roger Stone, just like DCLeaks followed RT and PressTV. Of course, he sprang back to life two days ago, right before Election Day, to complain about ""Democrats rigging the election."" I thought he didn't favour any political party?

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? “Do you feel in charge?” Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?

>TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight. But first questions.

>Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing “Free Press” is not being “Free as in free beer” or “Free as in free of government influence?

>Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

Maybe is being cleaned up? To peoples is being owner of pitchimpair computers, don’t be looking for files, rootkit will self destruct. Be making cold forensic image. @GCHQ @Belgacom TheShadowBrokers is making special effort not to using foul language, bigotry, or making any funny. Be seeing if NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX is making stories about now? Maybe political hacks is being more important?

Again, the usual old spiel of brave hackers fighting ""USSA""/""Amerikansky"" ""corruption"". It's gotten quite repetitive by now.

Bizarrely, they began posting Bill Clinton and Lorreta Lynch erotic fan fiction at some point:
